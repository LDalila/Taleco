The dubious status of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms A Constitutional Anomaly in the Czech Republic? On May 1, 1995, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, the remarkable leader of the Czech Republic, visited the University of Chicago. His visit became the occasion for an intriguing discussion of the status of constitutional rights in the Czech Republic. 
The bare facts are these. In 1991, the Federal Assembly of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic passed the Constitutional Act Instituting the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. This Charter was written with considerable help from Western Europeans and Americans. It contains an ample set of rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech and religion, protection against abuse of police authority, protection against discrimination, and much more in the way of civil rights and liberties. The Charter also includes a set of social and economic guarantees. Consider the following examples: Article 28: Employees are entitled to fair remuneration for work and to satisfactory working conditions. 
Article 29: Women, adolescents, and handicappedpersons are entitled to increasedprotection of their health at work and to specialworking conditions.Adolescents and handicappedpersons are entitled to specialprotection in laborrelations and to assistancein vocationaltraining. 
Article 31: Citizens areentitled underpublic insurance tofree medicalcare and to medical aid under conditions set by law. 
Article 30: Citizens are entitled to materialsecurity in old age and during incapacitationfor work, as well as in the case of loss of theirprovider.Everybody who suffers from material need is entitled to such assistance as is essentialforsecuring his or her basic living conditions. 
Article 35: Everybody has the rightto live in afavorable living environment. 
Article 32: Parents who are raisingchildren are entitled to assistancefrom the state. 
Article 26(3):Everybody has the right to acquire the means of his or her livelihood by work. The State shall provide appropriate material security to those citizens who are unable without theirfault to exercise this right. 
Shortly after the enactment of this Charter, the conflict between the two republics threw the status of the Charter into great doubt. But the Charter had a continuing effect on Czech and Slovak constitutionalism. The Constitution of the Slovak Republic was passed on September 1, 1992, and it expressly included the Charter, with deliberate modifications, in its text. On December 16, 1992, the new Czech Constitution was enacted. It did not, however, contain an explicit set of provisions guaranteeing fundamental rights and freedoms. Unlike the Slovak Constitution, it did not include the Charter in its text. Instead it contained two very short, relevant articles: Article 3: The Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedomsforms a part of the constitutionalorder of the Czech Republic. 
Article 4: The fundamental rights and freedoms shall enjoy the protectionof thejudicialpower. 
To say the least, these are unusual provisions. 
A lawyer, a political scientist, or a citizen of the Czech Republic should at this stage raise two questions: What is the precise status of the Charter in the current Czech Republic? And what was the genesis of these puzzling articles? The first question seems easier to answer than the second. Articles 3 and 4 appear to give the Charter the same status as anything else in the Czech Constitution. Something that is "a part of the constitutional order" seems, at least to an outsider, to -be a part of the Constitution. In any case some such conclusion seems very important to reach, since if the Charter is not part of the Constitution of the Czech Republic, there is no bill of rights in that republic-no protection of free speech, freedom of religion, fairness in the criminal justice system, or anything else. It therefore seems easy to conclude that the Charter has been made part of the Czech Constitution. 
But we should not jump to conclusions, for the problematic genesis of Articles 3 and 4 raises many relevant questions. Some people in the Czech Republic claim that these Articles were not voluntarily adopted by the Czechs at all, and were not a product of any deliberative judgment from the leaders and citizens of the Czech Republic. On their view, these articles were produced by a form of compulsion from the Council of Europe and from West European intermeddlers, and in particular from Brussels and Strassburg. This appears to be right, but it may not be the whole story. Some observers claim that Articles 3 and 4-and the specific contents of the Charter-had something to do with pressures from, among others, communists and former Communists, who wanted social and economic guarantees to receive constitutional status. 
I do not claim that either of these accounts is entirely true. In fact I do not know exactly what lay behind Article 3 and 4.. But it now seems clear that the odd genesis of both the Charter and Articles 3 and 4 has made their legal status highly questionable. Are they or are they not a serious part of the Czech Constitution? Are they enforceable in the Constitutional Court? Are they binding on the prime minister and the Parliament? Do the prime minister and other officials take them to be binding? What is the current status of the Charter and its many parts? Do the social and economic guarantees have the same status as political and civil rights? Might uncertainty about the guarantees create similar uncertainty for the rights? These are very important questions. But they are not easy questions to answer. 
We might draw three general conclusions from all this. First: The leaders and citizens of the new Czech Republic have not yet had a sustained discussion of what sorts of rights and liberties they want in their Constitution. Such a discussion should probably occur before very long, so as to create more security for rights than Article 3 and 4 may now provide. 
Second: Sometimes the problematic origins of a constitutional provision will give that provision dubious legitimacy. When leaders are aware of those problematic origins, a constitutional provision may not mean much. 
Third: In some parts of some postcommunist nations, the real-world consequences of constitutional provisions remain unclear. Under communism, constitutional guarantees were not worth the paper on which they were written; leaders felt free to ignore them if the situation so required. 
There is no doubt that many leaders in postcommunist nations, including Prime Minister Klaus, have done remarkable things under difficult circumstances, displayed brilliance and courage, and improved prospects for their people. But in some postcommunist nations, it is far from certain that leaders will deem themselves bound by constitutional provisions that they find inconvenient or that they dislike, because of their dubious origins or because of their consequences. 
An Eighteenth Century Presidency in a Twenty-First Century World 
Cass R. Sunstein* 
In the United States, the President is controlled by the Constitution, and in all respects subordinate to it. Insofar as it deals with presidential power, however, the American Constitution has proved to be a highly malleable document. With very few exceptions,' the constitutional provisions relating to the President have not been changed at all since they were ratified in 1787. But in the late twentieth century, those provisions do not mean what they meant in enforced judicially; but its meaning was hardly fixed when it was ratified. In particular, the contemporary President has far broader powers than the original Constitution contemplated. It is remarkable but true that large-scale changes in the authority of the President have been brought about without changes in the constitutional text, but nevertheless without significant illegality. 
This is a paradox. Is it not clear that constitutional changes, if not textual, are illegal? The paradox has considerable relevance to our current thinking about the presidency in particular and about constitutionalism in general. Perhaps the framers of the American Constitution feared legislative power most of all;2 but from well-known events in the twentieth century, it is possible to conclude that it is presidential power that holds out the greatest risks to both liberty and democracy. The President is by far the most visible leader in the nation; he is often the only person in government with a national constituency. Moreover, he is * Karl N. Llewellyn Professor of Jurisprudence, University of Chicago Law School and Department of Political Science. 
the diminished authority of the Electoral College. These provisions are closely connected with some of the changes discussed below, because greater democratic legitimacy helps account for greater authority. 
typically in charge of the armed forces, and his distinctive visibility can lead to a kind of "cult" that threatens constitutionalism and legality itself. On the other hand, a strong President has a distinctive democratic pedigree, and he is in a unique position to accomplish enormous good. An understanding of this fact has spurred large-scale changes in our conception of the presidency, especially in the New Deal period.3 
There is some dispute about whether the task of producing a strong President without endangering liberty has been successfully accomplished in the United States. Some people think that the American President is much too powerful; 4 others think that America has a weak president who is circumscribed by congressional "micromanagement" and unable to accomplish the tasks for which he is elected. This debate raises complex questions that I cannot discuss here. My purpose here is far narrower. I intend to show how the modern presidency is quite different from the founders' presidency, and then to make some observations about how all this has come about. 
I do not contend that the enormous changes in the nature of the presidency are illegitimate. In fact my purposes are mostly descriptive. But I do think that for those committed to the project of constitutionalism, it is important to maintain a degree of continuity between the twenty-first century president and that of the late eighteenth-century. I offer a few notations on that surprisingly difficult project. 
A general proviso: I will be covering a fair amount of territory in a short space, and most of the issues will not receive the detailed attention they deserve. My hope is that a brief and broad-gauged approach will provide a vivid picture of the changes that have occurred, and of how those changes might be defended. 
This essay is in three parts. Part I briefly describes some of the contrasts between the president of the late REV. 421 (1987). 
STRONG PRESIDENCY (1992). twentieth century and the president of the late eighteenth century. Part II outlines theories of constitutional change in the particular context of the expanded presidency. Part III offers some conclusions. 
It cannot be disputed that the original understanding of the presidency called for much less presidential authority than is taken for granted today.6 To be sure the prominent founder Alexander Hamilton, sought a powerful presidency.7 Moreover, the new Constitution created an executive where the Articles of Confederation did not; the creation of a novel executive branch was one of the most important innovations in the Constitution. But the original American President was exceptionally weak by contemporary standards. 
In domestic affairs, the President had relatively little law-making or even law-executing power, in part because of the limited authority of the national government, in part because of the general understanding that the President would have relatively little discretion in the lawmaking process or in law-implementation. In international affairs, the President's power was much narrower than it is now-in part because of the limited role of the United States in the world, in part because the President's principal unilateral power was to repel sudden attacks on the United States. 
It seems sensible to speculate that the increases in presidential authority have come in part because of the greater democratic legitimacy of the President given by national elections and by constant media focus on the President's plans and proposals. Nothing of this kind could havb been anticipated at the time of the founding. This was true in part because of the filtering effect of the Electoral College, which has withered since the founding period. To say the least, George Washington was a visible person. But the PROMISE UNFULFILLED (1985). 
enormously high visibility of the President has helped to create a massively different institution from what was anticipated. 
B. 
We can put constitutional changes in the power of the President in several categories. First, some changes offend no constitutional provision, but involve alterations from what the framers had expected or had hoped to achieve. Second, some changes do not clearly offend the constitutional text, but do violate the framers' understanding of what the text meant. Third, some changes offend the constitutional text. I will try to distinguish among these different kinds of changes below. 
Consider the following particulars, showing the contrast between the eighteenth and twentieth-century American presidencies. 
to have sharply limited authority in domestic affairs, partly because the federal government as a whole had sharply limited authority in the domestic arena. Basic regulation of the economy was to come from state government, and especially from state courts, which elaborated upon the common law of tort, contract, and property.8 To be sure, the President did have authority to make rules in some important areas. 9 But by modern standards, this authority was quite narrow. It did not involve much control over the domestic economy. 10 
By contrast, the modern President is a principal national lawmaker. The content of federal law has a great deal to do with the President's program and agenda. Much of this shift has occurred simply because of an unanticipated shift in power from the states to the federal government.

TREATISE (3d ed. 1994). 
government has helped to increase the authority of the President.1 In implementing national law, the executive branch, therefore, issues an extraordinary range of regulations affecting the national economy. 
It is a simple truth that the national government has far more authority than the framers of the Constitution originally envisaged. It is equally if less simply true that as an inevitable result of this shift, the President himself has assumed an array of duties and powers not within the contemplation of the Constitution's authors. 
The President's assumption of these powers is not in violation of the constitutional text (except to the extent that the current authority of the national government is itself unconstitutional). But there is no doubt that presidential powers are, along this dimension, quite different from what was anticipated. 
acts, the President needs congressional (or constitutional) authorization. He cannot exceed any limits that Congress has laid down. 12 He must "take Care that the Laws be faithfully Executed.' 1 3 But often Congress offers very vague guidance. The President has a great deal of discretion. Perhaps this discretion violates the Constitution, as a violation of the grant of legislative power to Congress. 4 Perhaps this is an impermissible delegation of legislative authority. But the twentieth century has witnessed a judicial refusal to enforce the nondelegation doctrine,' 5 which required clear standards from the legislature. The downfall of the nondelegation doctrine has meant that the President can exercise tremendous policymaking discretion in the domestic sphere. This sphere includes regulation of the environment, energy, occupational safety and health, communications, and much else besides. 
I do not suggest that the nondelegation doctrine was a clear constitutional imperative in the founding period, or i2. See Youngstown Sheet & Tbbe Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1959). -13. U.S. CONST. art. II, § 3. that in the original understanding, Congress was banned from granting broad discretion to the President.16 It is frequently observed, and lamented, that the nondelegation doctrine has not been used to invalidate a federal statute since 1935.17 It is less frequently observed, but no less important, that the doctrine was not used to invalidate a federal statute until that same year. The nondelegation doctrine enjoyed only one good year-a point that complicates the view that broad grants of policymaking authority are in violation of the original design. 
There can be no doubt, however, that the post-New Deal grant of discretionary authority to the President has altered the President's original constitutional role and greatly expanded his authority over the domestic sphere. We might be skeptical of the idea that courts should invalidate the grant of discretionary authority to the President, 8 while also agreeing that such grants give the President what is, in effect, legislative, or at least discretionary, power far beyond what was contemplated by the original Constitution. 
allow Congress to limit the President's authority over the many high-level officials who implement the laws enacted by Congress.1 9 If Congress saw fit, it probably had the constitutional authority to insulate some high-level officials from presidential supervision or discharge. This principle might seem to be a dry and technical matter, but it has enormous importance. If the Secretary of the Treasury can be controlled by the Congress, but not by the President, the allocation of national powers is much changed. 
It is now generally agreed, however, that the President has broad power over almost all high-level officials who im16. See KENNETH CULP DAVIS & RICHARD J. PIERCE, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW TREATISE (3d ed. 1994).

Sunstein, The Preside:,tand the Administration, 94 COLUM. L. REV. 1 (1994). A response can be found in Steven G. Calabresi & Saikrishna B. Prakash, The President'sPower to Execute the Laws, 104 YALE L.J. 541 (1994). plement the law. 20 To be sure, Congress has the constitutional authority to create "independent" agencies. 21 It is unclear, however, how "independent" the independent agencies really are, as a matter of law or practice. The Supreme Court has never told us, and in practice, the independent agencies are not so independent of the President.22 In any case, the heads of the Cabinet, and of most executive agencies, can be discharged by the President whenever the President chooses. In practice, this means that the President has enormous authority to control their activities. 
Moreover, Congress has no power to discharge administrative officials on its own and little power to prevent the President from acting however he wishes. (Of course both the President and all implementing officials must obey the instructions laid down by Congress.) The result is that most administration of the laws-an extremely large and important category-is subject to the will of the President. When the President changes, the administration changes as well, at least as a matter of technical law and largely, too, as a matter of practice. 
An especially interesting illustration of this phenomenon is the new process of White House supervision of agency rulemaking. This process received its most striking endorsement during the presidency of Ronald Reagan.23 President Clinton has made a similar claim of authority.24 In fact, President Clinton has gone somewhat farther than President Reagan, and in two different ways. First, he has asserted at least a measure of control over the so-called independent agencies; second, he has apparently claimed the authority to block regulations. At least as a technical matter, the process of White House supervision means that the President will have firm control over the rulemaking process. 
The assumption of broad presidential power over the executive agencies is not itself unconstitutional. That power is probably contemplated by Congress itself when it delegates authority to an executive agency, and there is nothing troublesome about presidential control of agents whom Congress has subjected to presidential control. But our current understanding of the constitutional landscape is not the founding understanding. Existing limits on Congress' power to structure what we call "the executive branch"--7however indistinct they may appear in hard cases-are far more severe than the limits at the founding period. 
submit to Congress both (a) a proposed budget and (b) a great deal of proposed legislation. As a result, the President now has a formidable role in the enactment of national legislation. The Constitution contains no explicit provision on the budget, and it does not clearly sort out the President's role with respect to congressional consideration of legislation. To be sure, the Constitution does grant the President the power to "recommend to [Congress'] consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient. '26 But it was not originally believed that the President would submit a budget to Congress, or that he would have a great deal of authority over the expenditure of national funds; nor was it understood that the President would play a dominant role in the national legislative process. 
Indeed, it is unclear exactly how much authority the President was supposed to have over the initiation of legislation. Despite the Constitution's provision on this point, President Washington suggested that " '[m]otives of delicacy ... have uniformly restrained the P[resident] from introducing any topick [sic] which relates to Legislative matters to members of either house of Congress, lest it should be suspected that he wished to influence the question before it.' "27 Hence, Washington "would not permit congressional committees to solicit his opinion, but intimated his willingness to express his views, when asked, to a friend. 28 
Washington's own approach does seem extreme; as I have noted, the Constitution itself authorizes a broader role.29 But in the founding period, it was hardly believed that the President would have the current powers of initiative, granting him considerable power over the content of national law. The President's modern power of initiative, with respect to the budget and lawmaking, is quite fundamental to the nature of our government. Of course, much legislation is initiated by people other than the President. But it is plausible to think that no one has as much authority as the President himself. This is not a violation of the Constitution. It is, however, a wholly unanticipated increase in presidential power. 
out to allow him a surprisingly large role in determining the content of national legislation. The founders of the Constitution deliberately and explicitly gave the President the veto power.30 But they did not contemplate its current importance, and they might well have been alarmed if they had been forewarned. 
In granting the President the power to veto legislation, the framers' principal goal was to allow the President to veto laws on constitutional, rather than policy, grounds.3' Their special goal was to permit him to prevent Congress from intruding on the President's constitutional powers. This goal was narrow indeed. The framers did not anticipate a situation in which the power to veto would entail a significant role over the development of policy in lawmaking. It is not entirely clear that the framers sought to allow HISTORY 55 (1948)(quoting George Washington, Letter (Feb. 1792), in 31 THE WRITINGS OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 493 (John C. Fitzpatrick ed., 1931-44)). the President to veto legislation solely on the ground that he disagreed with the policy judgments embodied in it (though probably the best reading of the history is that the founders believed that the President could veto legislation on policy grounds 32). But they thought that this power would be exercised rarely and only in the most extreme cases. 
The founders certainly did not anticipate the current situation, in which the veto power is a well-understood part of all lawmaking, and implies a large and continuous presidential role in lawmaking itself. In short: the President's legal and political authority is greatly augmented by Congress' knowledge that the President can veto legislation of which he disapproves. The deterrent effect of the veto should not be understated. The current veto power is probably best viewed as constitutionally acceptable, but as nonetheless producing a situation that the founders did not expect and would not have welcomed. 
power, the President's foreign affairs authority has become far more capacious than was originally anticipated. For the most part this is because the powers originally conferred on the President have turned out-in light of the unanticipated position of the United States in the world-to mean much more than anyone would have thought. The constitutionally granted authorities have led to a great deal of unilateral authority, simply because the United States is so central an actor on the world scene. The posture of the President means a great deal even if the President acts clearly within the scope of his constitutionally-granted power. Indeed, mere words from the President, at a press conference or during an interview, can have enormous consequences for the international community. 
In addition, however, the President has been permitted to initiate military activity in circumstances in which the original understanding would have required congressional authorization. On the founding view, a congressional dec32. See THE FEDERALIST No. 73 (Alexander Hamilton). laration of war was a precondition for war.33 The only exception was that the President could act on his own in order to repel a sudden attack on the United States.34 But in the twentieth century, a large amount of presidential warmaking has been allowed without congressional declaration of war.35 
We should distinguish among three categories here. First, some of these exercises of authority may have been unconstitutional. Some of them may have required a congressional declaration as a precondition for national action. Second, some may have been permissible because they involved military action short of "war." Third, some may have been permissible because the category of "sudden attack" must be understood capaciously under current conditions. I cannot desegregate these various possibilities here. Instead I offer a simple point: in any of these cases, the President's power goes far beyond what was expected. 
From all these points we might reaffirm the old truism that the Constitution-at least in the area of presidential authority-is no mere lawyer's document. The original understanding has not controlled the future. The Constitution's meaning is not fixed. It is in large part a function of historical practices and needs, and of shared understandings over time.36 Often the power of the President is understood to be quite different from what it was, say, twenty-five years earlier. 
But it would be a mistake to conclude that the President's constitutional power is simply a matter of what seems to him appropriate or necessary, and not a matter of law at all. Often the President loses in the Supreme Court, and in nearly every important case, he has graciously accepted his defeat. To take just a few examples from the twentieth century: President Nixon was forced to hand over 
J., concurring). his own tape-recorded conversations during the Watergate controversy; President Truman was prevented from seizing the steel mills during the Korean War; President Eisenhower was banned from stopping communists from travelling abroad.37 These defeats are important in themselves, but they are even more important for the general tone that they set. Every American President knows that his actions are subject to judicial review, and this is a large deterrent to illegal conduct. 
For purposes of judicial review, the President's most important constitutional duty is "to Take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. ' 38 This provision subordinates the President to the law. It also requires him to adhere to the law, both constitutional and statutory. 
I have suggested that the changing understandings of the President's power have occurred without either textual change or flagrant presidential violations of constitutional requirements. I have also suggested that this presents a genuine paradox. We have a president who is much stronger than the framers of the Constitution anticipated; but, at least in general, the current presidency is not thought, and should not be thought, unconstitutional. How, then, have the President's powers changed? There are several possibilities. 
A. 
Many of the changes have occurred because the relevant constitutional provisions are both spare and ambiguous, and they allow adaptation to changing circumstances. For example, the grant of "executive power" to the President leaves much uncertainty. To many modern readers, the term connotes all or much law-implementation. 39 It may have carried a narrower meaning in the founding period. Or consider the authority of the President in the area of foreign affairs. The relevant provisions are highly ambiguous, certainly on their face. It is hardly crystal clear what powers accompany the authority to be "Commander-inChief of the armed forces." 
The Constitution also contains important silences. The Constitution does not say whether the veto power comprehends policy disagreements. It does not describe the precise relation between the President and the administration. It does not discuss whether the President may submit a budget. Constitutional change has occurred in part because of constitutional ambiguities and silences. It seems obvious that a constitution that is not rigid, and that leaves gaps and uncertainties, will allow for adaptation without amendment or illegality. 
Many constitutions contain emergency provisions, allowing the government to have special powers under conditions of emergency. Most notably, the American Constitution contains no emergency provisions (although the President is allowed to suspend the writ of habeas corpus during war 0 ). It might seem natural to think that in spite of the absence of explicit emergency powers, many increases in presidential authority have occurred as a result of emergencies. Certainly it is true that some such increases occurred in the New Deal period, as a result of what some people believed to be the emergency conditions of the Great Depression. And some of the most dramatic exercises or vindications of presidential authority involved what many thought to involve emergency. 4' 
In general, however, changing powers of the presidency are not a product of emergencies. It would be a mistake to think that authorities have been conferred on the President because of an implicit "emergency provision" allowing American officials to do what is necessary in dire circumstances. Indeed, the President has rarely been found to have special authority to act during emergencies. A domestic crisis-widespread unemployment, social unrest40. U.S. CONST. art. I, § 9. does not give the President any new power.42 There is no judicial understanding that the President has greater authority if he can point to an emergency situation, or claim that unusual presidential action is crucial. 
Of course Congress might well decide to confer statutory authority on the President in order to enable him to respond to a crisis. Of course Congress has made this decision in emergencies. In the New Deal period, for example, Congress gave the President a range of new authorities because of the perceived need for special responses to the Great Depression. But the President has not been allowed to act on his own. An emergency does not give the President any unilateral powers. 
C. 
Some academic observers43 believe that in the United States, interpretation of the Constitution depends less on constitutional text and history and more on particular, casespecific judicial decisions. This process of case-by-case development allows the meaning of the document to change over time. Indeed, constitutional law in America (and in many other nations as well) has many features of the common law process. In that process, no one sets down broad legal rules in advance. The meaning of the Constitution is not a product of antecedent rules. Instead, the rules emerge narrowly as judges decide individual cases. Governing principles come from the process of case-by-case adjudication, and sometimes they Cannot be known in advance. It does seem clear that much of constitutional law in the United States comes not from the constitutional text itself, but from judge-made constitutional law, interpreting constitutional provisions. For this reason, the meaning of the document is not rigidly fixed when the document is written and ratified. 
Something of this kind is certainly true for the powers of the President, and the system of common law constitutionalism helps explain the shifting understandings of presidential power. Consider, for example, the complex question whether Congress or the President may discharge high-level public officials (the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Interior). The text of the Constitution does not speak clearly on this issue; instead, the governing constitutional principles have been worked out in the process of case-by-case adjudication. In Myers v. United States,44 the Court said that high-level executive officers must be subject to the plenary control of the President. In Humphrey's Executor v. United States,45 the Court qualified this rule, saying that officials exercising quasi-legislative and quasi-executive functions may be immunized from the President. In Bowsher v. Synar,46 the Court distinguished between a congressional role in removal of law-implementing officials, which would be impermissible, and independence, which would be acceptable. And in Morrison v. Olson4, 7 the Court said that purely executive officers may sometimes be made independent of the President. This elaborate body of doctrine, reflecting changing understandings over time, is a classic illustration of how the process of case-by-case adjudication, unburdened by general rules given in advance, can allow presidential authority to shift. 
It might be added that a good deal of presidential authority turns not on judicial decisions at all, but on traditional practices and shared understandings between the President and Congress. Common law constitutionalism occurs outside the judiciary. The development of these practices and understandings resembles the process of common law development. It is recognized that a certain practice "works"; Congress and the President endorse the practice; and the practice therefore operates as a guide for the future. Of course no such practices should be permitted to violate the Constitution where that document speaks with clarity. 
Some people, most notably Lawrence Lessig, 48 have argued that when circumstances have changed, the Supreme Court must "translate" the original constitutional text or history in order to adapt it to the new conditions. Suppose, for example, that the founders of the Constitution originally sought to allow the President to make war on his own only for defensive purposes-to repel sudden attacks on the United States. Suppose, too, that in modern conditions, threats to Canada and Mexico are extremely threatening to the United States because of the strategic importance of these nations to the American capacity for self-defense. Or suppose (as many people believe) that under current conditions, the line between "offensive" and "defensive" use of the military becomes extremely thin. New circumstances have made that original line far more ambiguous than it was at the founding. 
Consider another example. 49 Perhaps the original document gave the President less than complete authority over those who administer the laws. Perhaps the founders believed that Congress could insulate some administration from the President, on the theory that insulated administration would not, under the assumptions of the founding period, endanger any important constitutional commitments. It may be that insulated administration does endanger important constitutional commitments once the founding assumptions have been altered. Now that administration of the laws involves large-scale domestic policymaking, it may be intolerable-from the perspective of original constitutional commitments-to allow administrators to operate independently of the President, at least outside of certain confined areas. To maintain fidelity to constitutional commitments, we must understand the document to give the President power that he did not have at the founding. 
If this is true, perhaps it is generally true that original constitutional provisions, translated into a new context, give the President new and broader authority. If, to return to the first example, we want to adhere to the original constitutional goal-to allow the President to act unilaterally when necessary-perhaps the President may act unilaterally not simply to repel sudden attacks on the United States, but in any case in which American interests are at serious risk. Perhaps this view accounts for many of the changes I have described. 
The "translation" argument raises many complexities. The notion of "translation" is no more than a metaphor, and the task of interpreting a provision in new circumstances is hardly identical to the task of rendering words in another language. There are considerable complexities in deciding what it is that is being translated. What is being translated is not a brute fact, but itself the product of interpretation, in the form of a constructive account of some sort, one that has important evaluation dimensions. But the general idea of translation has appeared in several Supreme Court opinions as a way of making sense of the practice of interpretation in changed circumstances.5 0 In many ways the metaphor is useful. 
Some people, most notably Bruce Ackerman, think America has had more than one constitutional regimethat at crucial moments in our history, the people have inaugurated large-scale changes in the Constitution.5 1 The Civil War, for example, is said to have inaugurated a Second American Republic, with new understandings of the allocation of power between the nation and the states, and with new understandings of the allocation of power between the nation and the states, and with new understand50. See, e.g., Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985); Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349 (1910). 
ings of individual rights. Some people think that President Roosevelt's New Deal-responding to the Great Depression-also produced constitutional change. In his influential book, We the People: Foundations5,2 Ackerman argues that the United States has had three constitutional regimes, not simply one. In Ackerman's view, the New Deal was a constitutional moment, inaugurating a new constitutional regime. 
If America has had more than one constitutional regime, we might think about presidential power in a somewhat different way. During the Civil War period, the presidency became somewhat different from what it had been before.5 3 In the New Deal period, there were additional changes, many of them discussed above. The national government appeared to acquire significant new constitutional authority. The President was a principal beneficiary of this shift, especially insofar as the Supreme Court refused to enforce the nondelegation doctrine, which, as noted, required any legislative delegations of power to the executive to be narrow and clear. Some people therefore conclude that the New Deal effectively amended the Constitution, giving the President a range of new powers. 
There can be no doubt that after the New Deal, the Constitution meant something different from what it had meant previously. There can be no doubt that changing understandings of presidential power were an important part of this change. We may doubt, however, whether the notion of constitutional amendment is the most helpful way to conceive of things. In the United States, we identify the constitution with a written text. It is customarily thought that Constitutional amendments cannot occur without changes in constitutional text. The absence of a textual change seems devastating to the view that the New Deal amended the Constitution. To say that an unwritten change qualifies as a constitutional amendment does too much violence to our common understandings of what a Constitution is. 

On the other hand, it is right to point to the creative features of the New Deal period, and also to insist that our conception of constitutional meaning was different after Roosevelt from what it had been before. We can fruitfully think of the New Deal developments-if they are to be legitimated-as an effort to maintain fidelity with constitutional commitments through new interpretations as a result of changes over time. The commerce power, for example, plausibly means something quite different in the context of a highly interdependent economy from what it means in a period in which interstate consequences are far less likely. Permissible delegations of legislative power to the President may also shift when rapid changes in national policy became more necessary in light of the extent of national regulatory power and the need to keep up with changing developments of fact and policy.54 Moreover, we can take the Supreme Court's new constitutional interpretations post-New Deal as precedents, establishing the legitimacy of the New Deal entitled to a high degree of respect from subsequent generations. 
Discussions of "constitutional amendment" are helpful insofar as they draw attention to the creative aspects of the New Deal shift. But the notion of amendment seems too exotic and adventurous when more modest explanations do equally good explanatory work. 
In this essay, I have outlined some aspects of the extraordinary changes in the constitutional power of the President. I have also offered some diverse explanations of the changing nature of that constitutional power. There is no question that the current President is quite different from the founders' President. In some ways, it is hard for those committed to the project of constitutionalism to explain the discontinuities, which complicate the idea that the written constitution has a high degree of stability over time. One of the distinguishing features of the American Constitution is REPUBLIC, Jan. 20, 1992, at 32. its flexibility. The changed nature of the presidency is a testimonial to this fact. 
What best accounts for the changes? I have suggested that emergencies are not the source of constitutional change, and that it is too exotic to think that the Constitution was amended by the New Deal. The most promising explanations stress the flexibility of the original text, the process of common law adjudication, and the need to maintain fidelity with original commitments over changed circumstances. If these are the best explanations, it seems clear that a distinctive feature of the constitutional provisions governing the President is that they allow a large degree of adaptation over time. Moreover, it emerges that one of the virtues of the American constitutional experience is the process of case-by-case adjudication, giving meaning of constitutional provisions through close encounter with particular cases. 
The discussion suggests some broad outlines for constitutional interpretation as well. More "offensive" presidential authority with respect to military action is probably a good way of maintaining faith with the constitutional framework, in light of the problematic nature of the offense-defense distinction under modern conditions. General presidential control of the administration is also appropriate in light of the now-enormous authority of what has become known as the executive branch.5 It would be a mistake to reinvigorate the nondelegation doctrine, except, perhaps, for extreme cases; the purposes of the doctrine should be served through other means. 6 These general propositions leave many particular questions, but they might be taken to suggest some directions for the future. 
What lessons can be drawn from the American experience with constitutional constraints on presidential power? The question is of special importance not only for Americans, but for all others concerned with the nature of written constitutions, including those in Eastern Europe and South qualifications. 
323 (1987). Africa. Perhaps two lessons are of special importance. The first involves the limited effects of constitutionaltext, at least over time. Constitutional meaning depends in large part on shared understandings and practices. Most of these will not be in the Constitution itself. Although the Constitution is a legal document, there will be a great deal of opportunity to adapt constitutional meaning to changes in both understanding and practice over time. Words are outrun by circumstances. They may be rendered ambiguous by the sheer passage of time. New problems will emerge, and constitutional text may well fail to solve them, or even to address them. 
A second (and somewhat conflicting) lesson involves the importanceof a culture of constitutionalismin maintaining a constitutional order. Judicial review is an important, but by no means the only, contributor to the creation of such a culture. Without the courts, presidential illegality would be less frequently discouraged, and less frequently countered. But much of the relevant culture comes from shared understandings within the executive and legislative branches. This culture is needed to ensure against the most egregious abuses of legal authority, from the President as well as from others. 
In America, judicial review, and the constitutional culture more broadly, have been important as a check afterthe-fact and, perhaps even more, as a before-the-fact deterrent to presidential illegality. A culture of constitutionalism and the rule of law, spurred by judicial review, has helped deter presidential lawlessness in cases in which the need for action seemed great to the President, and the legal technicalities seemed like an irritating irrelevance. In such considerations, I suggest, lies the solution to a remarkable and insufficiently analyzed paradox of American constitutionalism: a dramatically changed and strengthened presidency, brought about without constitutional amendment and nonetheless without significant illegalities. 
HeinOnline -- 48 Ark. L. Rev. 21 1995 
Thank you all. It's a pleasure to be here for many reasons, one of which is that I see in the room people I have known at extremely diverse stages of my life, from students who were students in my very first classes at the University of Chicago to teachers I had when I was a student. But I won't identify them; it might embarrass them and make them feel less young than in fact they are. So thank you for having me. 
These remarks will come in five parts. I have five theses, and I am going to allocate three minutes to each of them. Each of them would of course require a fuller defense than I can supply here.' 
First: No approach to interpretation is self-justifying. Any system of interpretation needs ajustification. In that sense, personal judgments are unavoidable.2 
To this proposition, originalism is not at all an exception. It needs a defense of some sort. Those who find originalism attractive must mount a defense in terms of some account of the right or the good. References to legitimacy and political authority don't supply that defense; they are question-begging. 
In the end, any system of interpretation needs to be backed by a claim that that system, more than any other, will make for a good system of constitutional law. There is no way of avoiding our own judgments on that question. 
Second, constitutionalism in its American version has two fundamental goals. The first involves rule of law values. There is an intimate connection between constitutionalism and rule of law values: to-wit, the protection of stability, certainty, predictable expectations, and limits on official discretion, including prominently limits on judicial discretion.3

tenure ofjudges as essential tojudicial discretion); Antonin Scalia, The Rule ofLaw as a Law of Rules, 56 U. CHh L REv. 1175, 1177-80 (1989) (arguing that adherence to legal rules prevents arbitrariness). 
A second goal of American constitutionalism involves democratic concerns. On this view, constitutionalism attempts to furnish the preconditions for democratic self-government. In its best form, our system of constitutionalism has the rule of law and democratic self-government at its foundations.4 
Three: There are two forms of originalism, hard and soft. Hard originalism, which is the more famous, is unacceptable. For the hard originalist, we are trying to do something like go back in a time machine and ask the Framers very specific questions about how we ought to resolve very particular problems. The hard originalist view is the dominant theme ofJudge Bork's book.' 
Justices Scalia and Thomas sometimes speak as if they are hard originalists.6 Hard originalism is an unacceptable project because it is inconsistent with too much that is both settled and worthy in many areas, including free speech, religious liberty, racial discrimination, and sex discrimination. The problem with hard originalism-putting the epistemological problems to one sideis not that it is indeterminate, but that it would result in an unacceptably narrow set of liberties for the United States in the Twentieth Century.7 
There have been heroic efforts to show that the Framers' conception of religious liberty, race equality, sex equality, and free speech is acceptably ample.8 These heroic efforts are, I believe, notjust heroic but also a bit comic. We ought not to be fooled. It is not the case that the Framers' views justify the set of results that even those most suspicious of rights-based constitutionalism would find minimally necessary. 
The fact that hard originalism is inconsistent with a minimal approach to free speech, religious liberty, and race and sex equality is important because any system of interpretation depends on a justification (recall thesis one). That justification must, broadly speaking, have a connection to whether such a system would make the world better or worse. Abstract words like political legitimacy and political theory won't do the job. This is why hard originalism is very hard to defend in principle. 
On what account, I ask, would hard originalism be better than the interpretive alternatives? This is the unanswered question. People who purport to be hard originalists tend to rest content with large-sounding but question-begging abstractions. 
Fourth: Soft originalism is a valuable project and it has great advantages over the alternatives, originalist and nonoriginalist. For the soft originalist it matters very much what history shows; but the soft originalist will take the Framers' understanding at a certain level of abstraction or generality. As Judge Bork rightly argues, it matters that the First Amendment, for the Framers, had a large connection with democratic self-government.9 A democratic conception of the First Amendment is defended in significant part by virtue of the fact that that was the Framers' understanding.' 0 A conception of the Equal Protection Clause that takes from the history a ban on second-class citizenship in the United States provides a defensible interpretive strategy. Indeed, it is a desirable interpretive strategy; it helps orient our inquiry. 
Soft originalism thus does not run afoul of the problems faced by hard originalism, and it is much better for rule of law reasons and for democratic reasons than nonoriginalist alternatives of the sort defended by Ronald Dworkin" and practiced on occasion by the Warren Court.'" 
Fifth: It would be very good to converge, if we could, on soft originalism. Soft originalism does have a problem, however: its incompleteness as a theory of interpretation. Soft originalism needs supplementation. At its best, our practice in the United States has two supplementary devices, neither of which should be foreign to nor incompatible with Federalist Society aspirations. One supplementary device is Burkean; the other is Madisonian. 
From the standpoint of the rule of law, the problem with soft originalism is that the soft originalist identifies constitutional aspirations at a level of imprecision. How is it that we can have a system committed to the rule of law in the face of that fact? We don't have to look terribly far. As Burke saw, the great legal achievement of the English system is the common law.15 And our system of constitutional law is in significant part a process of caseby-case development. The origin of constitutional doctrine is not principally in the understandings of the founders, but rather in rules developed by the Supreme Court over generations and generations. Our rules come from case-by-case development, Burkean style. That is where the rule of law under our constitutional system has its vindication, not by particular understandings of the Founders. 4 
What about democracy? A measure of judicial restraint is highly desirable. What I would like to suggest is that we have had too little of it and that the source ofjudicial restraint ought not to be principally or at all in hard originalism, but ought to be instead in more self-consciously democratic or, to be a little more precise, Madisonian considerations. This is a suggestion that the supplement to soft originalism ought to be an account of democracy, or republicanism-one that sees the judicial role as passive and restrained, except in cases where Madisonian considerations themselves argue for a judicial role. 
We can have a lot of debate about what that particularly entails. That was (roughly) John Hart Ely's project.1 5 I suggest that a version of that project is the right way to pursue the democratic aspirations of good Madisonians (noting that "democratic" was not a word that Madison was thrilled with).16 
Let me suggest that the Burkean and Madisonian supplements to soft originalism are far more promising than hard originalism, 1962) (1790).

Five Theses on Opiginalism which is really a misguided surrogate for the constitutional values of the rule of law and democratic self-government. Soft originalism, thus supplemented, brings out the underlying judgments more clearly and more honestly-and, most important, it does not rely on question-begging or (I think) impenetrable claims about legitimate authority.

Cass R. Sunstein: "Free Speech and Democracy" 
Traditionally, civil rights leaders and civil libertarians have stood side by side when free speech claims were at stake. In fact, minorities and others lacking political and economic power, in their struggle for equality, often are the most ardent advocates of free speech as they battle to have their messages heard and their complaints confronted. However, in recent years these old allies frequently have found themselves in adversarial positions as they respond to cries for regulations of hate speech, pornography, and hostile work environments. 
Essentially, civil libertarians and civil rights advocates have different views concerning the roles and importance of expression. Civil libertarians are skeptical about prevalent understandings of truth and, thus, would prefer reliance on an unregulated competition of ideas in the market to any state-imposed conception of truth. Civil rights advocates see the value of speech as consequential, as it helps the attainment of other societal values such as equality, justice, civility, and so forth. When these views overlap, as they did in the civil rights movement of the 1960s, their distinctive bases may be ignored. In the 1980s and 1990s, however, we have become more sensitive of the interplay between power, both economic and political, and communication. Differentials in power affect access to potent channels of communication which, in turn, aggravate these power differentials. For some civil rights advocates, the laissez-faire assumptions of the libertarian's marketplace seem highly unrealistic when power discrepancies are factored in. Historically subordinated, disempowered, or discriminated-against groups, they insist, need active government intervention if equality and an integrated community are to be attained -- and that intervention may need to take the form of regulating speech that interferes with efforts at obtaining the desired equality and community. 
Consequently, the historical alliance between civil libertarians and civil rights advocates seems at risk. The conflict, at times, appears as fundamental as choosing which of two paradigms is the proper basis for analysis. Should one begin by championing the values of free speech and asking when the demands for equality are sufficiently strong to constitute a compelling state interest? Or should our goal be one of fostering a community embracing equal dignity, and then inquiring when speech needs are compelling enough to override that objective? Curiously, the very act of labeling something as a "free speech" problem as opposed to an "equality" problem often appears to channel and predetermine outcomes. 
This symposium will both ask and attempt to answer whether there is a true conflict between these paradigms; whether each can accommodate the other; and whether strategies are available to minimize the apparent tension existing between them. 
As a starting point for any effort to confront the strains posed by our ambition to simultaneously promote values of community and those of free speech, one must understand the function of free speech in our governmental structure -25 both as aspiration and as reality. In this regard, I would like to introduce to you our keynote speaker. 
Professor Cass Sunstein, an unsurpassed scholar in jurisprudence, constitutional, administrative and environmental law, is the Karl N. Llewellyn Professor of Jurisprudence at the University of Chicago, a position jointly held in the Law School and the Department of Political Science. He received his A.B. from Harvard College and his J.D. from Harvard Law School where he served as executive editor of the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review. He served as a law clerk to Judge Benjamin Kaplan of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and, thereafter, for United States Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. Following his clerkships, he briefly worked as an attorney advisor in the Office of Legal Counsel at the United States Department of Justice before joining the University of Chicago Law School, where he has remained except for visiting positions at both Columbia and Harvard. Professor Sunstein has authored numerous books and an incredible number of articles, essays and book reviews, but none more important for our purposes today than his recent book, 
Professor Sunstein has titled his remarks this morning simply as "Free Speech and Democracy." After five years of repeated efforts on my part, I'm most pleased to have the opportunity to present to you Professor Cass Sunstein. CASS SUNSTEIN: I'm grateful to you all. Mostly I'm grateful to Stan for his persistence. It's not a coincidence that my daughter was born slightly over five years ago today, and that accounts partly for the difficulty in getting me here before this time. 
My task this morning is to determine whether liberty conflicts with equality. It is widely assumed that it does. The assumption of conflict has large consequences for how we think of the free speech principle. Perhaps our efforts to protect free speech are in tension with our efforts to promote equality. But we should hesitate before accepting that claim. Any conception of liberty, or free speech, has to be specified and defended; the term is not self-defining. The same is true for any conception of equality. It may be that once we identify the appropriate conception of free speech in our constitutional order, and once we do the same for our conception of equality, the tension between the two will be eliminated or at least much diminished. 
At the very least, we should recognize that the free speech and equality guarantees are not purposeless abstractions. They have purposes and goals. Once those purposes and goals are identified, we may be able to make progress on current free speech dilemmas. 
In this talk, I will spend some time defending a conception of free speech that is associated with democratic self-government. That conception of free speech contains a principle of political (not economic) equality. To this extent, the free speech principle is fully compatible with a large part of our nation's commitment to equality. From the creation of the American republic, political equality has been a defining ideal, and the ideal was sharpened and deepened during the Civil War and the New Deal period.' The equal protection clause has itself come to embody a conception of political equality, as in the "one personone vote" principle. 2 To this important extent, the Constitution's commitment to equality is quite compatible with its commitment to free speech. At the end of this talk, I will attempt to illustrate this proposition with reference to a number of areas of current dispute. 
The equality guarantee has another dimension. The Fourteenth Amendment was designed to eliminate a system of caste -- to ensure that the state would not turn the morally irrelevant characteristic of race into a systematic basis for second-class citizenship.3 On this view, the Fourteenth Amendment embodies an anticaste principle. So understood, the Fourteenth Amendment bears on current controversies involving pornography and hate speech, and I will discuss these associations later. My basic goal here is to attempt to diffuse the conflict between equality and freedom of expression, by offering understandings of these concepts that are not in severe tension, but that are mutually reinforcing, and that promise to help us escape from some apparently serious theoretical and practical dilemmas. 
There are two free speech traditions in the United States,4 not simply one.5 There have been two models of the First Amendment, corresponding to the two free speech traditions. The first emphasizes well-functioning speech markets. It can be traced to Justice Holmes' great Abrams dissent,6 in which the notion of a "market in ideas" received its preeminent exposition. The market model emerges as well from the great case of Miami HeraldCo. v. Tornillo,7 invalidating a "right to reply" law as applied to candidates for elected office. It finds its most recent defining statement not in judicial decisions, but in an FCC opinion invalidating the fairness doctrine.8 
The second tradition, and the second model, is focused on public deliberation. It owes its origins to the work of James Madison.9 The second model can be traced from Madison, with his attack on the idea of seditious libel, to Justice Louis Brandeis, with his suggestion that "the greatest threat to democracy is an inert people,"' 0 through the work of Alexander Meiklejohn, who associated the free speech principle with ideals of democratic deliberation." The Madisonian tradition culminated in New York Times v. Sullivanl2 and the reaffirmance of the fairness doctrine in the Red Lion case,' 3 with the Supreme Court's suggestion that governmental efforts to encourage diverse views and attention to public issues are compatible with the free speech principle -- even if they result in regulatory controls on the owners of speech sources. 
Under the marketplace metaphor, the First Amendment requires -- at least as a presumption -- a system of unrestricted economic markets. Government must respect the forces of supply and demand. At the very least, it may not regulate the content of speech so as to push "the speech market" in its preferred directions. Certainly it must be neutral with respect to viewpoint. For the marketplace model, Tornillo 14 is perhaps the central case, and inequality is not a problem or even an issue. The Federal Communications Commission has at times come close to endorsing the market model, above all in its decision abandoning the fairness doctrine.' 5 When the FCC did this, it referred to the operation of the forces of supply and demand, and suggested that those forces would produce an optimal mix of entertainment options.' 6 Hence Mark Fowler, Chair of the Commission, describes television as "just another appliance.... It's a toaster with pictures."' 7 
HeinOnline -- 6th Constitutional Law Symposium Drake L. Rev. 27 1995 
Those who endorse the marketplace model do not claim that government may not do anything at all. Of course government may set up the basic rules of property and contract; it is these rules that that make markets feasible. Without such rules, markets cannot exist at all."' Government is also permitted to ensure against market failures, especially by preventing monopolies and monopolistic practices. Structural regulation is acceptable so long as it is a content-neutral attempt to ensure competition. It is therefore important to note that advocates of marketplaces and democracy might work together in seeking to curtail monopoly. Of course the prevention of monopoly is a precondition for well-functioning information markets. 
Many people think that there is now nothing distinctive about the electronic media or about modem communications technologies that justifies an additional governmental role.19 Many people say nothing about the problem of political equality and its relation to freedom of speech. If a governmental role was ever justified, it was because of problems of scarcity. When only three television networks exhausted the available options, a market failure may have called for regulation designed to ensure that significant numbers of people were not left without their preferred programming. But this is no longer a problem. With so dramatic a proliferation of stations, most people can obtain the programming they want, or will be able to soon.20 With new technologies, perhaps there are no real problems calling for governmental controls, except for those designed to establish the basic framework. 
The second model, receiving its most sustained attention in the writings of Alexander Meiklejohn, 2 1 emphasizes that our constitutional system is one of deliberative democracy. This system prizes both political (again, not economic) equality and a shared civic culture. It seeks to promote, as a central democratic goal, reflective and deliberative debate about possible courses of action. The Madisonian model sees the right of free expression as a key part of the system of public deliberation. 
On this view, even a well-functioning information market is not immune from government controls. Government is certainly not permitted to regulate speech however it wants; it may not restrict speech on the basis of viewpoint. But it may regulate the electronic media or even the Internet so as to promote, in a sufficiently neutral way, a well-functioning democratic regime. It may attempt to promote attention to public issues. It may try to ensure diversity of view. It may attempt to promote political equality. It may promote political speech at the expense of other forms of speech. In particular, educational and public affairs programming, on the Madisonian view, has a special place. 
In my view, the Madisonian conception is superior to the marketplace alternative, which creates insoluble theoretical and practical problems. 22 For constitutional lawyers, the argument for the Madisonian conception is partly historical; the American free speech tradition owes much of its origin and shape to a conception of democratic self-government. The marketplace conception is a creation of the twentieth century, not of the eighteenth. Insofar as it ignores political equality, it confuses modern notions of consumer sovereignty in the marketplace with democratic understandings of sovereignty, symbolized by the transfer of sovereignty from the King to "We the People." The American free speech tradition finds its origin in that conception of sovereignty, which, in 
Madison's view, doomed the Sedition Act on constitutional grounds. 23 If interpretation of the First Amendment is to be based partly on historical considerations, the marketplace model is hard to sustain. 
But the argument for Madisonianism does not rest only on history; it is partly evaluative as well. We are unlikely to be able to make sense of our considered judgments about free speech problems without insisting that the free speech principle is centrally (though certainly not exclusively) connected with democratic goals, 24 and without acknowledging that marketplace thinking is inadequately connected with the point and function of a system of free expression. The marketplace model, in its purest form, faces decisive counterexamples. The government regulates attempted bribery, private libel, false or misleading advertising, unlicensed legal or medical advice, threats to assassinate the President, conspiracies, and much more. Few people believe that all of these regulations are constitutionally impermissible. By itself, the marketplace model lacks the resources to explain distinctions that the law does, and should, recognize. Free speech absolutism is a sham; the question is how to distinguish between protected and unprotected speech, and the marketplace model cannot help in that task. 
Moreover, a well-functioning democracy requires a degree of citizen participation, which requires a degree of information; and large disparities in political equality are damaging to democratic aspirations. 25 The marketplace model is unhelpful on these points. To the extent that the Madisonian view prizes education, democratic deliberation, and political equality, it is connected, as the marketplace conception is not, with the highest ideals of American constitutionalism. 
Some people think that the distinction between marketplace and Madisonian models is now an anachronism. 26 Perhaps the two models conflicted at an earlier stage in history; but in one view, Madison has no place in an era of limitless broadcasting options and cyberspace. Perhaps new technologies now mean that Madisonian goals can best be satisfied in a system of free markets. Now that so many channels are available, cannot everyone read or see what they wish? If people want to spend their time on public issues, are there not countless available opportunities? Is it not hopelessly paternalistic for government to regulate for Madisonian reasons? 
I do not believe that these questions are rhetorical. We know enough to know that even in a period of limitless options, our broadcasting system may fail to promote an educated citizenry and political equality, and Madisonian goals may be severely compromised even under technologically extraordinary conditions. There is no logical or a priori connection between a well-functioning system of free expression and limitless broadcasting options. We could well imagine a science fiction story in which a wide range of options coexisted with little or no high-quality fare for children, with political inequality, with widespread political apathy or ignorance, and with social balkanization in which most people's consumption choices simply reinforced their own prejudices and platitudes, or even worse. Quite outside of science fiction, it is foreseeable that free markets in communications will be a mixed blessing. They could create a kind of accelerating "race to the bottom," in which most people see low-quality 
HeinOnline -- 6th Constitutional Law Symposium Drake L. Rev. 29 1995 programming involving trumped-up scandals or sensationalistic anecdotes calling for little in terms of quality or quantity of attention. 
It is easily imaginable that the content of the most widely-viewed programming will be affected by the desires of advertisers, in such a way as to produce shows that represent a bland, watered-down version of conventional morality, and that do not engage serious issues in a serious way for fear of offending some group in the audience. It is easily imaginable that well-functioning markets in communications will bring about a situation in which those interested in politics merely fortify their own unreflective judgments, and are exposed to little or nothing in the way of competing views. It is easily imaginable that well-functioning markets in communications will be accompanied by, and help create, political inequality. 
For this reason, the marketplace model offers an unhelpful approach to modern dilemmas. The Madisonian alternative is far superior. Notably, that model has an important positive dimension. It calls for broad public attention to public issues, and for exposure to diverse views. It claims that there is a problem with a system in which many citizens and views are deprived of effective access to communications. On this account, the goals underlying the fairness doctrine are perfectly compatible with the free speech guarantee. It may be doubted whether the doctrine actually promoted those goals and, even more, whether the doctrine is suitable for current conditions. But there is a pressing need to understand the connection between the free speech principle and democratic selfgovernance. 
Despite my remarks to this point, it is undeniable that in many areas of current law, there is at least a potential conflict between freedom of expression and equality. The best way to approach or even to diffuse these problems is to try to understand the purposes of the relevant principles. I have suggested that the equality principle is best understood as referring to political equality and opposition to caste, and that the free speech principle is best understood in Madisonian terms. In the remainder of this talk, I will attempt to show how these ideas might bear on current controversies. The discussion of each issue will be very brief. I attempt to show how apparent conflicts might be approached without suggesting final answers. 
In Turner Broadcasting System v. FCC,2 7 the Supreme Court issued an important ruling about the interaction between the free speech principle and principles of equality. The Court held that the government could regulate the speech of cable company operators if its goal was to promote broad viewer access to sources of speech. The Court explored the relevant legislative findings, which showed that without the "must carry" rules at issue in the case, free broadcasting might be endangered, and thus Americans without access to cable television might be deprived of their crucial source of information, including information about public affairs. 
In particular, the Court recognized a distinctive and legitimate legislative concern in the probability that cable operators have a strong financial interest in favoring their own affiliated programmers, and to do so at the expense of broadcast stations. The findings therefore suggested that the cable operators have an economic incentive not to carry local signals. This fact led to the important problem supporting the Act: Without the must-carry provision, Congress concluded, there would be a threat to the continued availability of free local broadcast television. 28 On the Court's account, the elimination of broadcast television would in turn be undesirable not because broadcasters deserve protection as such -- they do not -- but (a) because broadcast television is free and (b) because there is a substantial government interest in ensuring access to free programming, especially for people who cannot afford to pay for television. As Congress had it, the mustcarry rules would ensure that the broadcast stations would stay in business. The Court said that this purpose -- the protection of access to free programming through the protection of broadcast stations -- was unrelated to the content of broadcast expression and therefore legitimate. 
What is important about Turner is the recognition that regulation of speech might be justified if it is an attempt to ensure broad and free access to communication, especially communication about public issues. Insofar as the Supreme Court so held, it accepted an important part of the Madisonian model, and rejected the commitment to unrestricted economic markets. The Court was correct to take this step, and its decision may have broad implications for the future.29 
Sometimes it is said that "universal access" is one of the appropriate goals for any information superhighway. The question of access has several dimensions. To some extent it is designed to ensure access to broadcasting options for viewers and listeners -- the central problem in Turner. To some extent the problem is to ensure access for certain speakers who want to reach part of the viewing or listening public. In cyberspace, of course, people are both listeners and speakers. 
It is possible to regard the goal of universal access with considerable skepticism. The government does not guarantee universal access to cars, or housing, or food, or even health care. It may seem puzzling to suggest that universal access to information technologies is an important social goal. But if we focus on the goal of political equality, the suggestion can be shown to be less puzzling than it appears. Suppose, for example, that a certain network becomes a principal means by which people communicate with their representatives; suppose that such communications become a principal part of public deliberation and in that way ancillary to the right to vote. We know that a poll tax is unconstitutional because of its harmful effects on political equality. 30 
On a broadly similar principle, universal access to the Internet might be thought desirable. To be sure, such access would be most unlikely to be constitutionally mandated, since the right to vote is technically not involved. But universal access could be seen to be part of the goal of political equality. More generally, universal access might be necessary if the network is to serve its intended function. 
The point might be generalized. For any particular speaker, part of the advantage of having access to a certain means of communication is that everyone, or almost everyone, or a wide range of people, can be reached. The United States mail might be justified in part on the ground that a national system of mail is necessary or at least helpful to ensure that any letter can reach everyone. Perhaps a requirement of universal access can be justified not as an inefficient 1 effort to subsidize people who would be without service, but on the quite different ground that universal service is a way of promoting the communicative interests of those who already have service. The interests of the latter group may well be promoted by ensuring that they can reach everyone, or nearly everyone. 
Arguments of this kind have been used throughout the history of telecommunications regulation. For most of the twentieth century, there have been cross-subsidies, as local companies with local monopolies have charged high prices to certain customers (usually businesses) with which they subsidized less profitable services. Perhaps a similar model would make sense for modern technologies. 
There are, however, significant inefficiencies in this model of cross-subsidization, and a system of open-ended competition may well be better than one based on universal access. It may well be that open-ended competition will provide universal access in any case, or something very close to it. Or it may be that open-ended competition, combined with selective subsidies, would be better than the regulatory approach. This question cannot easily be answered in the abstract. Certainly debate over universal access should not be resolved by constitutional fiat. This is an area for public debate and a large degree of experimentation, especially in light of lurking problems of political inequality. 
Congress might attempt to regulate speech so as to promote Madisonian goals of attention to public issues and political equality. Suppose, for example, that Congress sets aside a number of channels for public affairs and educational programming, on the theory that the marketplace provides too much commercial programming, and insufficient exposure to diverse views. We could imagine a requirement that telecommunications carriers must provide access at preferential rates to educational and health care institutions, state and local governments, public broadcast stations, libraries and other public entities, community newspapers, and broadcasters in the smallest markets. Or we could foresee a "set-aside" program for educational and public affairs programming. 
What would be the constitutional status of efforts of this kind? Turner is the leading case, and it certainly does not stand for the proposition that such efforts are constitutional. By hypothesis, any such regulation would be contentbased. It would therefore meet with a high level of judicial skepticism. On the other hand, Turnerdoes not authoritatively suggest that such efforts are unconstitutional. The Court did not itself say whether it would accept content discrimination designed to promote Madisonian goals. Certainly the opinion suggests that the government's burden would be a significant one. But it does not resolve the question. 
It is notable that Justice O'Connor's opinion appears quite sensible on this point, and she leaves the issue open.3 2 Her principal argument was that the "must-carry" rules are too crude on the point. Certainly crudely-tailored measures give reason to believe that interest-group pressures, rather than a legitimate effort to improve educational and public-affairs programming, are at work. But if the relevant measures actually promote Madisonian goals, they should be upheld. There is of course reason to fear that any such measures have less legitimate purposes and functions, and hence a degree of judicial skepticism is appropriate. But narrow measures, actually promoting those purposes, are constitutionally legitimate. 
Restrictions on campaign expenditures are frequently justified by reference to political equality. The key Supreme Court case on campaign finance regulation is of course Buckley v. Valeo,3 3 in which the Court rejected the claim that controls on financial expenditures could legitimately be justified as a means of promoting political equality. In this way, Buckley seems highly reminiscent of the pre-New Deal period. Indeed Buckley might well be seen as the modern-day analogue of the infamous and discredited case of Lochner v. New York,34 in which the Court invalidated maximum hour laws. 
In the key passage, the Court announced that "the concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment."" The Buckley Court therefore saw campaign expenditure limits as a kind of "taking," or compulsory exaction, from some for the benefit of others. The limits were unconstitutional for this very reason. 
For those concerned about equality, this is a troubling and unjustifiable conclusion. On the view reflected in both Buckley and Lochner, reliance on free markets is government neutrality and government inaction. But in the New Deal period, it became clear that reliance on markets simply entailed another -- if in many ways good -- regulatory system, made possible and constituted through law. We cannot have a system of market ordering without an elaborate body of law. For all their beneficial qualities, markets are legitimately subject to democratic restructuring -- at least within certain limits -- if the restructuring promises to deliver sufficient benefits. What is perhaps not sufficiently appreciated, but what is equally true, is that elections, and speech expenditures, based on existing distributions of wealth and entitlements also embody a regulatory system, made possible and constituted through law. Here as elsewhere, law defines property interests; it specifies who owns what, and who may do what with what is owned. The regulatory system that we now have for elections is not obviously neutral or just. On the contrary, it seems to be neither insofar as it permits high levels of political influence to follow from large accumulations of wealth. 
Because it involves speech, Buckley is in one sense even more striking than Lochner. As I have noted, the goal of political equality is time-honored in the American constitutional tradition, as the goal of economic equality is not. Efforts to redress economic inequalities, or to ensure that they are not turned into political inequalities, should not be seen as impermissible redistribution, or as the introduction of government regulation into a place where it did not exist before. A system of unlimited campaign expenditures should be seen as a regulatory decision to allow disparities in resources to be turned into disparities in political influence. That may be the best decision, all things considered; but why is it unconstitutional for government to attempt to replace this system with an alternative apparently better from the standpoint of political equality? The Court offered no answer. Its analysis was startlingly cavalier. Campaign finance laws should be evaluated not through axioms, but pragmatically in terms of their consequences for the system of free expression. 
The questions raised by pornography regulation have produced a lengthy and complex debate. From the Madisonian point of view, however, we can announce a simple conclusion: Much pornography is far from the center of constitutional concern. Pornography is not plausibly intended and received as a contribution to public deliberation, at least as a general rule. Hence it may be regulated without the extraordinary showing required for regulation of political speech. 36 
To say this is emphatically not to say that pornography is wholly without constitutional protection. Speech that is not at the First Amendment "core" cannot be regulated without a legitimate showing of harm. 
In the context of pornography, a reasonable legislature could make the necessary showing. There is good reason to believe that pornography can be associated with harms that government has a right to prevent, including, first, at least some brutality and coercion in its production and, second, at least some sexual violence and harassment in its use. These harms are closely connected with the anticaste principle that I have outlined. For constitutional purposes, what is relevant is not whether a court is convinced by the relevant evidence, but whether a reasonable person could find it persuasive. There is little doubt that a reasonable person could so find. The issue, then, is not whether pornography can be regulated, but whether any relevant proposals have the necessary clarity and narrowness. It is these more particularized questions that we should be discussing. There is no constitutional barrier to attempts to regulate pornography as such. 
What about hate speech? Here Madisonians find the question of regulation much harder. A good deal of imaginable hate speech is fully protected under the Madisonian framework. For loyal Madisonians, hate speech qualifies for constitutional protection if it is intended and received as a contribution to democratic discussion of public issues. Much of what is called "hate speech" certainly so qualifies. Imagine, for example, a claim that women's natural place is in the home, or that African-Americans are genetically inferior to Asian Americans, or that homosexuals are "sick." We may contest or deplore such statements, but they do qualify for constitutional protection, certainly in most circumstances. They are part and parcel of democratic debate and deliberation. 
There are two possible exceptions to this claim. First, some hate speech consists of epithets, or of little more than epithets. On an analogy to the obscene telephone call, face-to-face epithets should not receive constitutional protection. Here the state can legitimately regulate speech in the interest of anticaste goals. Narrow restrictions on hate speech should therefore be upheld. Second, public colleges and universities may have somewhat greater room than do governments generally to regulate hate speech, and this is so by virtue of their educative goals. It should be recalled that educational institutions regulate speech all the time; they grade speech, they require teachers to teach some things but not others, they punish or reward speech during appointments and tenure decisions. It would be far too broad to say that educational institutions may not reward or punish speech. 
This simple fact does not give educational institutions carte blanche to censor. It must always be asked whether public institutions are responsibly attempting to promote their legitimate educational mission, or instead punishing viewpoints with which they disagree. But it can be imagined that modest, narrow hate speech restrictions, perhaps going beyond "epithet" regulation, can be legitimate in the eductational setting. Perhaps colleges or universities could conclude that epithets, and hate speech that is little more than epithets, make it impossible for them to accomplish their educational missions. Courts should be reluctant to invoke the First Amendment to prevent institutions from reaching this plausible conclusion. 
I emphasize that this is a judgment about constitutional law and not about appropriate policy. Undoubtedly it is best, usually, to proceed without "codes" and to do things in an informal, consultative manner. But this is not a matter for courts to decide. 
My principal goal here has been to identify and defend a Madisonian conception of the First Amendment, and to bring that conception into contact with an understanding of equality that emphasizes the political domain and the time-honored American opposition to caste. I have suggested that equipped with these understandings, we might be able to soften the tension between free speech and equality, and perhaps to diffuse it altogether. 
I conclude with a passage from Alexander Meiklejohn. What Meiklejohn says is, I think, especially important for a period in which a marketplace model of free speech tends to dominate legal and political culture, and in which the purpose or point of the free speech principle sometimes seems lost. Meiklejohn wrote: 
enlarge and enrich it. The freedom of mind which befits the members of a self-governing society is not a given and fixed part of human nature. It can be increased and established by learning, by teaching, by the unhindered flow of accurate information, by giving men health and vigor and security, by bringing them together in activities of communication and mutual understanding. And the federal legislature is not forbidden to engage in that positive enterprise of cultivating the general intelligence upon which the success of self-government so obviously depends. On the contrary, in that positive field the Congress of the United States has a heavy and basic responsibility to promote the freedom of speech.37 (194 (1987 (1985). 
note 4. 
Audience Discussion STANLEY INGBER: Following each of our speakers and panels, we have set aside a block of time for you, the audience, to ask questions and make comments. Microphones have been set up on both sides of the aisle. Since we are taping these proceedings for publication as a book, please begin your remarks by identifying yourself and stating your professional affiliations. As we're waiting, I'll break the ice with the first question. 
You used Professor Meiklejohn as an important focus of your talk. For many years Meiklejohn argued that the First Amendment was an absolute insofar as it protected communication relevant to democratic self-government. But, according to Meiklejohn, speech that was not related to that self-governing interest was outside of the First Amendment parameters totally -- it might be covered by other constitutional protections, such as those of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, but not First Amendment protections. You bypassed that position of Meiklejohn, and potentially of both Madison and Bork, by saying that although political speech is at the heart of the First Amendment, other speech is protected as well, although perhaps not as strenuously. But you didn't, I think, give us a principle as a basis for that protection. If, in fact, the function of the First Amendment is democratic self government, what is the principle that allows even a more reduced protection in other fields? At some point, Meiklejohn abandoned his position because he had trouble with the exclusion of arts, music, and areas of literature from First Amendment coverage. Also, when he looked around historically and globally, societies that were perceived as restrictive of free speech were seen partially as restrictive in those fields. But I don't think you've given us an articulated principle to explain that perspective, other than to say that it would be uncomfortable to suggest that all these areas were external to the First Amendment. 
CASS SUNSTEIN: Well, this is true. Meiklejohn's original position was that the First Amendment was only about political speech -- the other stuff was a due process issue. That isn't my view and the text is evidence against it. I don't think it is actually decisive, but the text doesn't say "freedom of political speech," it says "freedom of speech." That's actually a cheap argument if intended to be full because we have to know what "freedom of speech" means. Maybe it meant "freedom of political speech." The text at least is trouble, I think, for the Meiklejohn-Bork view. The history is not unambiguously supportive of the view that political speech is the only kind of speech protected by the First Amendment; there are broader suggestions. In any case, that position is foreclosed by judicial precedent, just from a lawyer's point of view. Even though some art and entertainment may have no political component, it would be impossible, given existing law, to say that they were unprotected by the First Amendment. 
So I think that you are exactly right -- I haven't described the sorts of human interests that are safeguarded by protection of non-political speech. To complicate what I've said a bit, let me just say that I don't think any unitary theory of free speech value would be adequate; that is, the political theory that I've tried to suggested would be the focus or principle concern, but not the exclusive one. There are other human interests having to do with deliberation about whom one should be friends with, or what kind of sexuality is desirable, or whether there really is something called the top quark -- as some physicists now believe. There are deliberative and other interests that are protected by speech that aren't political and that justify guarding these things in at least a second tier. 
I don't mean to say that once you're in a second tier of speech, you're at grave risk; the government still has to show something. So sexually explicit speech, for example, that can't be associated with any harms, on my view, that's constitutionally protected. In the pornography debate, we have to build up the case for regulation from harms caused, which is why I think the child pornography area is quite easy to handle, as are cases involving harms in the form of abuse of women in pornography production -- where let's say they're suing for damages -- these seem to be easy First Amendment issues. But then we get harder cases having to do with women suing because of harms they say have resulted from other people reading pornography, that becomes trickier. 
So what I want to suggest is that the strict Bork position isn't mandated by text or history, is foreclosed by judicial practice, runs up against very widespread judgments of probably everyone in this room, and that there are other human interests we can identify -- non-political interests -- that supplement the Madisonian case for a First Amendment. 
MAURA STRASSBERG (Audience): I'm Maura Strassberg from Drake University. My question comes back to the arts. What I'm particularly interested in are things like gay fiction and gay films. Very often you can look at these things as pornography and say "harm." The problem here, some would say, is that these are spreading "insidious values" through the culture, and so you can have a "harm" regulation. At the same time, gay art is probably the driving force of gay political rights in the sense of bringing gayness to the public forum. How do we try to distinguish the politics underlying something that is not presented explicitly as political speech, and weigh that against the alleged harm it causes? This is particularly problematic when the First Amendment is made to carry the weight for what really ought to be an equal protection concern. Clearly, in most gay rights cases today, the First Amendment is being asked to do what the Equal Protection Clause really ought to be doing. CASS SUNSTEIN: The only gay material I know is the Robert Mapplethorpe photographs and I think that the Mapplethorpe material probably was political in the relevant sense. There were political statements that Mapplethorpe was making that bore directly and self-consciously, and everyone understood this, on issues of what the state does. So the Mapplethorpe stuff was political in the relevant sense. To put it more clearly, what Mapplethorpe is for is not what pornography is for; Mapplethorpe's work had components of a political statement. 
Additionally, the harms of pornography are linked to the Lincoln framework of an anti-caste idea. Mapplethorpe's work can't be seen as creating or supporting a caste system. Since gays and lesbians are pretty close to being "second class citizens" in the United States today, the notion of regulating their speech can't be defended as a means of protecting others from lower caste status. Who would be being protected? So I think the arguments that call for regulation of violent pornography call for protection of homosexual pornography. It is political in the relevant sense and the relevant harms usually aren't there. GREGORY SISK (Audience): Gregory Sisk, Drake University Law School. The concern I have with what you talked about is that when you use such terms as "less valuable speech" versus "valuable speech," political speech being the most valuable," or other types of speech being less valuable, and when you talk about concrete examples, it sounds as if you're applying your own subjective values and judgments to what you think to be more valuable versus what is less valuable. Yet it is precisely these sorts of judgments we do not wish to delegate to government. Because everything that has an expressive component ultimately is political, even the simple conversation I have over the back fence with my neighbor -- it may not have any political content to it at all, but it helps to develop who we are as a people, what we are as neighbors, which in turn influences the way we interact in our community. In this sense, it has a political effect. 
Literature is the same. The most innocuous kinds of expression ultimately have that kind of value. So even if we take the Madisonian approach, everything ultimately is political in that sense. But even more importantly, how could we ever delegate to anyone the ability to make choices as to what is more valuable or less valuable? Particularly how could we delegate it to political entities made up of politicians who likely would determine what is valuable and less valuable by what is popular and less popular in that particular electoral region? CASS SUNSTEIN: That's an important concern. Let's see how to approach it. One question we might ask is whether the framers had judgments of value which underlay their conception of what speech is protected or not? And there the answer is "absolutely." If you read the writings of Joseph Story or other materials of that early period, they were clear that freedom of speech didn't include all words, that licentious speech or libelous speech was regulable. Now think about that -- "licentious." Furthermore, libelous then meant a lot more than it does now. So certainly the authors of our free speech principle thought that judgments of value had to be made, should be made, would be made. 
Now if you don't like that, I think the simplest response to the concern about judgments of value is that they're inescapable. To run a system of free expression without making judgments of speech value is not possible, and people who think it's possible ought to think a little more. If you think about a case involving attempted bribery which is hopelessly ineffectual, or a threat to assassinate the president that's really pathetic, or an attempt to defraud commercially that's so transparent that no one's going to be defrauded, each of these three cases -- attempted bribery, attempted fraud and an attempt to assassinate the president -- have speech that is protected by the First Amendment? If so, then the view that we ought not to make judgments about value is truly radical. It purports to be simply the stand of convention and common sense. But if it has the effect of protecting speech in these cases, this is a very radical position. Many statutes become unconstitutional. Most conspiracies in the United States, happily, aren't going to harm anybody. Fortunately the government tries to stop them even so. Now does the government have to show that conspiracies, insofar as they're proved by speech, are actually going to produce something before you can criminalize them? So the first part of the answer is that the framers certainly thought judgments about value would be made. The second is that I think it's impossible to run a system of free expression without making those judgments, and the sad thing is we make them covertly without saying so. 
The third thing you talk about is the political nature of all speech. Now, it's very possible that my account of free speech value is just wrong, and another would be better. Great. If we can design another account, political or non-political, and it would be better -- wonderful. If it leads to better and different results, that's even more wonderful. But this is the best I can do. Maybe we can work together in the next few days to come up with something we like more. Of course you're right -- anything can be deemed political. But in order to do the work that a theory of free speech value has to do, we have to give an account of the "political" that's narrower than "anything." Otherwise we're in the domain of no judgments about value again. So my definition of the political is intended and received as a contribution to public deliberation about issues. Now that has a degree of indeterminacy about it, but words cannot escape indeterminacy. So if that standard isn't any good, let's come up with another one. 
It's interesting to note that no justice in the Supreme Court's history has denied the need to make judgments of free speech value. And our law reflects judgments of free speech value. And the American Civil Liberties Union, I don't believe, really denies that judgments about free speech value have to be made at some point. So the Court has not given a test, but maybe that's better than giving a test, because any test would be inadequate. But it's good to try to come up with tests and standards and rules. 
KINGSLEY BROWNE (Audience): Kingsley Browne, Wayne State University Law School. My question is how do you decide what caste is? You mentioned a minute ago that perhaps gays and lesbians are a caste or fast approaching a caste. What about racists and sexists? They're certainly a reviled minority -- at least we hope they're a minority these days -- yet it's precisely their speech that you provide some support for regulating. Who's to stop us from saying that racists and sexists are now a caste? They are certainly a people that usually have to express their views in private, because of the scorn that would be heaped on them if they didn't. CASS SUNSTEIN: Yes. Well, two things. I think the simplest way of thinking of who is lower caste is to look at indicators of social well being, like jobs, poverty and wealth, political representation, subjection to crime and so forth. So along those dimensions, African-Americans are very obviously a second class and women slightly less obviously, but also so. What I'd like to do is to look at dimensions of social well being and see who's systematically low. That's what Lincoln was thinking about. 
KINGSLEY BROWN (Audience): But you emphasized a couple of times, though, when you were talking about equality that you weren't talking about economic equality. And now I think what I'm hearing you say is you don't mean economic equality, you mean political equality, but we'll use economic well being as a proxy for political equality. So it ends up being pretty much the same thing, doesn't it? CASS SUNSTEIN: Maybe I've been unclear, but there are two different ideas. One is the notion of political equality, which is not economic equality. The second notion is the anti-caste idea, as to which systematic disparities along economic dimensions are relevant in showing second class citizenship. Note that the anti-caste principle is not egalitarian, because to say that people defined in terms of a morally irrelevant characteristic like skin color should not be systematically below another group, is not to say that everyone should have the same income. So my view is that if we had a society in which people with blue eyes, let's say, were systematically below people with brown eyes, there'd be a problem. Whereas, if there's a society where there's large disparities in economic well being fairly randomly distributed, on my view, from the standpoint of the American constitutional lawyer, that society does not have a problem. It would, of course, have some social, rather than constitutional, problems. So the notion that anti-caste can be measured by seeing whether one group defined in terms of a morally irrelevant characteristic is systematically below another does not constitute an argument for economic equality as a constitutional norm. 
On racists and sexists, I have two thoughts. One is it would be quite surprising if racists and sexists were systematically below non-racists and nonsexists in the sense that they had more poverty, they were less frequently employed. If they were, what I think would have to be added to the analysis, which I think is in Lincoln's work, is an evaluative dimension which finds that the disadvantaged group is defined by some morally irrelevant characteristic. So if racists have such problems as they do because people are unhappy with their racism, then we wouldn't have Lincoln's problem of people defined in terms of a morally irrelevant characteristic. I do think if it were true that society took racists and made it so they couldn't have jobs and they were all in poverty, then we'd have a real problem. It wouldn't quite be the problem Lincoln is talking about, and both fortunately and unfortunately we're nothing like near there. MARIANNE WESSON (Audience): I'm Mimi Wesson from the University of Colorado Law School. Cass, you're very graceful in conceding the difficulty of distinguishing political speech from less political or non-political speech, and you acknowledge the complexities of examples like the Mapplethorpe example. But I'm wondering if there isn't a more fundamental difficulty with that distinction. In some cases, it may be the harm, that you say is the second prerequisite to the regulation of free speech, flows directly from its political character, as in the case of pornography. I'm not sure I'm happy with the suggestion that pornography's message is not a political one. Many anti-pornography feminists would say that the message of pornography is precisely a political one. It makes the political argument that they are second class, that women are there to be hurt, that they are there to be exploited, that they are there simply for men's pleasure. And this political argument has an effect. In fact, it coincides rather nicely with some empirical evidence that suggest that observers of some kinds of violent pornography will be less likely to believe that a rape occurred when they're shown a depiction of a rape; they're more likely to believe that the woman somehow "asked for" it or "deserved" it. So doesn't it pose a great difficulty for your theory that it may be that the harm created or caused by pornography rests precisely on the politics of the message that it conveys? CASS SUNSTEIN: That may be a problem. If we had a speaker who said, "Women are second class, they like the sorts of things we see in pornography and those things are great, and nations that allow them are really free," I would say that's at the core of First Amendment protection. So if it's the case that pornography is rightly described as making an argument to that effect, then the Madisonian thinks you have to have a clear and present danger or something of that sort justifying regulation. Then we don't have the commercial speech analogy anymore. But I think there's a difference between pornography, even if it has political effects, and those statements I just made. Pornography may have political effects of the sort you described, but it's not accurately described as intended and received as a contribution to public debate about some issue. 
This isn't an adequate response, but I think the issue, when you say feminists perceive pornography as political, is what is meant by that word "political." Probably not the same thing as what the Madisonian means. Attempted bribery, for example, is awfully political in its effects, and yet not for that reason in the First Amendment core. Commercial advertising is for the cultural studies person as political as anything gets, but it would be surprising for the Supreme Court to say that commercial advertising is the same sort of thing that Madison was talking about when protesting the Sedition Act. So I think your use of the word "political" seems just right for the purpose for which you're using it. But my suggestion is that for purposes of figuring out what the First Amendment is about, we have a different conception of the "political." 
If, on the other hand, government is trying to regulate pornography because of its political effects -- meaning, let's say, because it's creating a world in which women's role is not the right one, and we could describe it that abstractly -- then I get worried about the legitimacy of the government's reason for regulating pornography. Government should not be allowed to regulate pornography because pornography contains a politically wrong message. This is why it seems to me better from a First Amendment point of view to regulate pornography (if it is to be regulated) on the grounds that it's associated with tangible real world harms, like harms in the production and harms in the use rather than harms caused by persuading people about certain things. What I wouldn't want is the government regulating literature because the political message was wrong or the political effects were wrong. 
It depends on how we understand the word "political." What the feminist anti-pornography arguments, including yours, I take to be, least controversially, are that pornography is associated very clearly with harms that the government has a right to protect against. 
MARIANNE WESSON (Audience): And what are those harms, in your view? CASS SUNSTEIN: Well, most simply, violence in the production and use. MARIANNE WESSON (Audience): Anything beyond that, in your view? Let's assume that there was valid consent by all of those who participated in the production of pornography, and that they were all adults. But let's assume further that someone who consumed pornography was encouraged thereby to go out and harm someone who had not consented in any way. Do you think providing that victim with some sort of compensation is compatible with your theory of the First Amendment? CASS SUNSTEIN: Sure, if you can prove causation. So if I see a civil damage remedy, maybe with a damage cap ... 
CASS SUNSTEIN: Yeah, I know. I think I said that by reflex. That's like a libel case. 
MARIANNE WESSON (Audience): Cass, what would you say to someone who would respond by saying, "Well, the reason that person was encouraged to go out and harm his victim is that he responded to a political message encoded in the pornography, and the political message was 'it's okay to treat women this way because they really like it, and if they don't like it, they deserve it."' CASS SUNSTEIN: I think "political message encoded" doesn't make something political speech within the meaning of the First Amendment. MARIANNE WESSON (Audience): Isn't that what you said about Mapplethorpe, that there was a political message encoded? CASS SUNSTEIN: I don't think it's encoded. I might just be wrong on both Mapplethorpe and pornography. What I understand pornography of the regulable sort to be basically is a masturbatory aid. And that can be great, but that's not what the First Amendment is centrally all about. Mapplethorpe is not that. And even if you have a masturbatory aid that encodes political messages, the notion that that's at all close to what Madison is talking about seems odd. These are very good questions. I know I haven't adequately answered them. CATHY CROSSON (Audience): Cathy Crosson, Indiana University. Cass, I disagree with many, many of your stated and unstated assumptions which I think you need to unpackage. I think the over-arching question to me is what is our agenda here? I seem to read your remarks' global impact as basically a position that a niggardly approach to free speech is justified by a project of equality. CASS SUNSTEIN: A niggardly approach to free speech? That's not what I'm for. 
CATHY CROSSON (Audience): I think an approach to free speech which cuts out personal autonomy issues, which cuts out the ability to receive ideas and information and to express ideas that are not inherently political, is a very narrow one. 
CASS SUNSTEIN: I hope I said to Stan that that was not my view, that truthful commercial advertising and non-harmful sexually explicit stuff are right in the First Amendment -- they're just not in the core. 
CATHY CROSSON (Audience): I think to treat these autonomy issues as not being at the core First Amendment is consistent with the bulk of Supreme Court decisions, not Stanley v. Georgia (1969), not Cohen v. California(1971), which I consider to be the high water marks, but certainly that's consistent with most existing doctrine. I'm not sure we want to be bound by that or stop there or end our project of constitutional development there. And in that regard, if equality is part of this project, if we are going to justify a lot of regulation of speech by their impact on lower caste people, by their adverse effects on equality, then it raises several questions about your approach. First of all, I'm uncomfortable with using as a polestar for our discussion the views and conceptions of the white male elite who happened to be in power two centuries ago as opposed to the strivings of living, breathing people today for their freedom and equality. I think that's where we should start. We should be looking empirically at what proposed regulations of free speech actually mean for strivings for equality and freedom. I also am deeply troubled by the idea that we can separate political from non-political speech, and I believe that in the current power structure that the aspects of free speech which are most important for most people, are the more emotive selfdevelopment, personal autonomy aspects of having as wide as possible access to ideas and information and artistic expression. 
I'm also troubled by this kind of "less is more" argument, to put a crude label on it, whereby you seem to say that because universities engage in all kinds of non-free speech decisions, because there are all kinds of invidious censorship going on in the university in terms of who gets tenure, etc., that justifies more limitations on free speech; that because workers in the work place currently have such limited autonomy in terms of speech rights, that that justifies more restrictions on their personal autonomy. In fact, I think if our project is human freedom and development and equality, that for all those reasons we should be arguing for much less censorial approaches to speech on college campuses and in the work place. 
The final assumption I find very troubling is that government is, in any substantial sense, really about the task of promoting equality. When I look around in the context of the onslaught on the welfare system and other attacks on the lower caste, I find very troubling the idea that we should entrust greater power to censor speech on a government that I do not think in any way is about promoting the dissolution of castes in our society. 
CASS SUNSTEIN: I think those are good points, but they are mostly political rather than legal points. You say rightly that what we ought to be principally concerned about is living people today, rather than white male elites which produced the Constitution. And I think insofar as we are citizens, absolutely, and the framers, I think, would be with you on that. So far as we're talking about constitutional law, I think there's an obligation to think at least somewhat historically, and for us not to feel free to mold the Constitution anyway we wish. The notion that we can't trust our government to promote equality -- I don't know. The idea that any pornography regulation will misfire -- maybe. CATHY CROSSON (Audience): But that's certainly our empirical experience. It gets used against gay literature overwhelmingly. 
CASS SUNSTEIN: Well, that's a fine political point. But you know, the FDA, -- I'm completely with the Republicans on the FDA -- it's doing terrible things, and they ought to reform it so it doesn't stop good drugs from getting on the market. But the FDA isn't unconstitutional; we have a political process to deal with it. Under your conception -- maybe I misunderstand you -- it seems that the First Amendment is doing so much work which I think ought to be done through democratic debate. Now, if you don't like the political/non-political line, and I confess I don't love it, mostly because of the indeterminacy, then the question is what sort of line would be better? I guess I want to suggest also that, although as lawyers we can think very well of hard cases, with the Madisonian approach as I've described it almost all cases are very easy. I mean, the Stanford University hate speech restriction -- that's fine; the University of Michigan one -- not fine. One goes into the democratic domain, one doesn't. 
You raise a bunch of interesting topics. I do think you're right that for most people non-political speech is, in a sense, more important than political speech. I think for most people, food is much more important than any speech, but food isn't protected by the Constitution. So I think to put the arguments you're making into the Constitution is what's troubling to me. I guess I have a bit of the reaction that some people had to the Warren Court: that there are a lot of things here that might be good, but the notion that the judges should impose them because they're good is unclear. 
STANLEY INGBER: We're going to have a number of panels which clearly will be dealing with similar types of topics. Before we begin our first panel, we'll take a short break.

JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG3 
INTRODUCTION 
There is a familiar image of justice. She is a single figure. She is a goddess, emphatically not a human being. She is blindfolded. And she holds a scale. 
In the real world, the law cannot be represented by a single figure. Legal institutions are composed of many people. Our courts are run by human beings, not by a god or goddess. Judges need not be blindfolded; what they should be blind to is perhaps the key question for law. And judges have no scale. Far from having a scale, they must operate in the face of a particular kind of social heterogeneity: sharp and often intractable disagreements on basic principle. 
The problem of social pluralism pervades the legal system. Some of the relevant disagreements are explicitly religious in character. Others might be described as quasi-religious in the sense that they involve people's deepest and most defining commitments. What is the appropriate conception of liberty and equality? How should people educate their children? Should government punish people on the basis of deterrence only or should it consider retribution as well? Is the free speech principle about democracy or instead individual autonomy? 
There is much dispute about whether well-functioning democracies should try to resolve such disagreements, and about how they should do so if they do try.4 Perhaps government should seek an "overlapping consensus"5 among reasonable people, thus allowing agreements to be made among Kantians, utilitarians, Aristotelians, and others. Perhaps participants in a liberal democracy can agree on the right even if they disagree on the good.6 Thus a sympathetic observer describes the liberal "hope that we can achieve social unity in a democracy through shared commitment to abstract principles."7 
This is a promising approach, and in some settings, it may work. But an investigation of actual democracy, and of law in actual democracies, raises questions about this view. Democracies - and law in democracies - must deal with people who very much disagree on the right as well as the good. Democracies - and law in democracies must deal with people who tend to distrust abstractions altogether. Participants in law are no exception. Judges are certainly not ordinary citizens. But neither are they philosophers. Indeed, participants in law may be unwilling to commit themselves to large-scale theories of any kind, and they will likely disagree with one another if they seek to agree on such theories. 
Judges also have to decide many cases, and they have to decide them quickly. Decisions must be made rapidly in the face of apparently intractable social disagreements on a wide range of first principles. These disagreements will be reflected within the judiciary and other adjudicative institutions as well as within the citizenry at large. At least this is so if adjudicative institutions include, as they should, some of the range of views that are included in society generally. 
In addition to facing the pressures of time, these diverse people must find a way to continue to live with one another. They should also show each other a high degree of mutual respect and reciprocity. Mutual respect may well entail a reluctance to attack one another's most basic or defining commitments, at least if it is not necessary to do so in order to decide particular controversies. Participants in law, even more than in democratic debate generally, do well to follow this counsel. 
My suggestion in this Commentary is that well-functioning legal systems often tend to adopt a special strategy for producing agreement amidst pluralism. Participants in legal controversies try to produce incompletely theorized agreements on particular outcomes.8 They agree 8 Consider the notion of overlapping consensus as set out in RAWLS, cited above in note 4, at 133-72. The idea of an incompletely theorized convergence on particulars is related. Both ideas attempt to bring about stability and social agreement in the face of diverse "comprehensive views." But the two ideas are far from the same. I am most interested in the problem of producing agreement on particular outcomes and low-level principles (defined below at p. I 740) to justify them, with the thought that people who disagree on general principles can often agree on individual cases. Rawls is interested in a related but different possibility - that people who disagree on comprehensive views can agree on certain political abstractions and use that agreement for political purposes. See id. at 43-46. Of course this is also true. 
What I am suggesting here shares with Rawls's project the goal of producing social stability and a degree of mutuality among people who differ on fundamental matters. But a goal of the incompletely theorized agreement is to obtain consensus on a judgment among people who do not want to decide questions in political philosophy and who (for example) are uncertain as between political liberalism and perfectionist liberalism, or as between liberalism and certain alternatives. Such people may want to decide a case involving tort law, or free speech, or equality, by reference to principles that can be accepted by political and perfectionist liberals, and others as well (if this is possible). In this way, we might conclude that judgments in law and politics sometimes bear something like the same relation to political philosophy as do judgments in political philoso 
HARVARD LAW REVIEW on the result and on relatively narrow or low-level explanations for it. They need not agree on fundamental principle.9 They do not offer larger or more abstract explanations than are necessary to decide the case. When they disagree on an abstraction, they move to a level of greater particularity. The distinctive feature of this account is that it emphasizes agreement on (relative) particulars rather than on (relative) abstractions. This is an important source of social stability and an important way for diverse people to demonstrate mutual respect,10 in law especially but also in liberal democracy as a whole. 
Consider some examples. People may believe that it is important to protect endangered species, while having quite diverse theories of why this is so. Some may stress obligations to species or nature as such; others may point to the role of endangered species in producing ecological stability; still others may point to the possibility that obscure species will provide medicines for human beings. When (and if) people who agree on the same course of action are able to do so from different foundations, they need not choose among foundations. So too, people may favor a rule of strict liability for certain torts from diverse starting points, with some people rooting their judgments in economic efficiency, others in distributive goals, and still others in conceptions of basic rights. Similarly, people may invoke many different foundations for their belief that the law should protect labor unions against certain kinds of employer coercion. Some may emphasize the potentially democratic character of unions; others may think that unions are necessary for industrial peace; others may believe that unions protect basic rights. 
Of course particular issues, in these as in other areas, are disputed as well. Complete agreement is unlikely in matters of this sort. Disphy to questions in metaphysics. (On Rawls' view, see RAWLS, cited above in note 4, at xix-xx.) Just as the political philosopher may attempt not to take a stand on metaphysical questions, so the lawyer, the judge, or the political participant may urge outcomes that make it unnecessary to solve large questions in political philosophy. In a liberal society committed to allowing people of different fundamental views to live together with mutual respect, the Rawlsian strategy may sometimes founder on confusion, limitations of time and capacity, and fears that political liberalism is itself too sectarian to serve as a defining political creed. I do not mean to suggest that the Rawlsian project is unable to surmount these concerns. Certainly there must be constraints on the content of incompletely theorized agreements, and those constraints take the form of abstractions. But I do mean to suggest that participants in liberal political culture often seek agreement on what to do rather than exactly how to think. When they reach these agreements from diverse starting points, they can promote liberal goals in a way that has some distinctive advantages. I do not attempt here to sort out all of the relations between the idea of an overlapping consensus and the notions I have in mind; more detailed discussion will appear in SUNSTEIN, LEGAL REASONING AND POLITICAL CONFLICT, cited above in note *. 
9 I am thus emphasizing relative rather than absolute particularity. See infra pp. 1739-41. It is also possible that people may agree on abstraction while disagreeing on particulars, a kind of incompletely theorized agreement that also has legal uses. See infra p. I739. 
10 There is an exception, having to do with certain kinds of invidious or palpably confused abstractions. See infra p. I747. agreement on foundations may produce disagreement on particulars. What I am emphasizing is that, when closure cannot be based on relative abstractions, the legal system is often able to reach a degree of closure by focusing on relative particulars. Examples of this kind are exceptionally common. They are the day-to-day stuff of law. 
When the convergence on particular outcomes is incompletely theorized, it is because the relevant actors are clear on the result without being clear, either in their own minds or on paper, on the most general theory that accounts for it."1 Some people may not have decided on the best general theory; in their individual capacities, they may think that it is unnecessary to choose among competing general theories, because whatever theory is best, the same result follows. It is common for a judge to believe that a certain outcome is right because all possible theoretical positions lead to it. Alternatively, a particular judge may believe that he knows which theory is best, but may not be able to say so in an opinion, for fear of being outvoted, or because other judges on his court are uncertain whether he is right and would prefer to leave the more abstract issues for another day. 
Often judges can agree on an opinion or rationale offering lowlevel or mid-level principles and taking a relatively narrow line. They may agree that a particular rule is binding and makes sense - a sixty-five mile-per-hour speed limit, a requirement that people be provided a hearing before losing their homes - without agreeing on or entirely understanding any set of purported foundations for their belief. They may accept an outcome - reaffirming Roe v. Wade,12protecting sexually explicit art - without knowing or converging on an ultimate ground for that acceptance. Reasons are almost always offered,13 and in this sense something in the way of abstraction accompanies the outcome; reasons are by definition more abstract than the outcome for which they account. But the relevant actors seek to stay at the lowest level of abstraction necessary for the decision of the case. They hope that the reasons that have been offered are compatible with an array of deeper possible reasons, and they refuse to make a choice 11 Interesting issues of collective choice lurk in the background here. Important problems of cycling, strategic behavior, and path dependence may arise in multimember bodies containing people with divergent rationales, each of whom wants to make his rationale part of law. See generally KENNETH J. ARRow, SOCIALCHOICE AND INDIVIDUAL VALUES passim (2d ed. I963) (analyzing problems of public choice). There may also be complex bargaining issues as some officials or judges seek to implement a broad theory as part of the outcome, while others seek a narrow theory, and still others are undecided between the two. These important issues are beyond the scope of the present discussion, though it would be most illuminating to have a better grasp, theoretically and empirically, of the sorts of bargaining games that occur when officials and judges decide on the scope of the theory to accompany an outcome. Cf DOUGLAS G. BAIRD, ROBERT H. GERTNER & RANDAL C. PICKER, GAME THEORY AND THE LAW 6-49 (1994) (applying game theory models to analyze how players choose among different legal regimes). 12 410 U.S. 113 (I973). 13 For exceptions, see the discussion below at pp. 1754-60. among those deeper reasons if it is not necessary to do so. This phenomenon raises questions about many prominent accounts of judging, particularly that of Ronald Dworkin, which I discuss below.'4 
By emphasizing incompletely theorized agreements, I intend partly to describe existing practice. These agreements are a pervasive phenomenon in Anglo-American law and, in particular, in judge-made law. Indeed, they play an important function in any well-functioning democracy consisting of a heterogeneous population. The persistence of such agreements offers a challenge to people who think that areas of law actually reflect some general theory, involving (for example) Kantian or utilitarian understandings.'5 
I want, however, to make some normative claims as well. These claims are connected with the distinctive morality of judging and perhaps the distinctive morality of politics in a pluralistic society. It is customary to lament an outcome that has not been completely theorized, on the ground that any such outcome has been inadequately justified; but there are special advantages to incompletely theorized agreements in law (and elsewhere). Such agreements are especially well suited to the institutional limits of the judiciary, which is composed in significant part of multimember bodies, consisting in turn of highly diverse people who must render many decisions, live together, avoid error to the extent possible, and show each other mutual respect. The virtues of incompletely theorized agreements extend as well to social life, to workplace and familial life, and even to democratic politics. I will note these possibilities without discussing them in detail here. 
Of course I do not suggest that there is no place in society or law for ambitious theories. Such theories are an important part of the academic study of law, which can influence legal and political institutions. Certainly such theories are legitimately a part of democratic deliberation. To reveal practices as confused or unjust, or to decide whether practices are confused or unjust, it may be necessary to think at high levels of abstraction. Indeed, judges might well raise the level of theoretical ambition if this is necessary to decide a case, or if a high-level theory can be shown to be a good one and they can be persuaded to agree to it. But participants in adjudicative institutions are - and should be - very cautious before taking this step. 
14 See infra pp. 1757-60. 
15 See, e.g., RONALDDWORKINL, AW'SEMPIRE240-50 (I986) (arguing that tort law requires inquiry into abstract "justice");RiCHARDA. POSNERE,CONOMICANALYSISOF LAW23 (4th ed. I992) (arguing that the common law actually promotes economic efficiency). Of course, advocates of a deep theory might urge that incompletely theorized agreements, taken as a class, tend to reflect a certain theory even if the theory has not been adopted self-consciously, and that those decisions that are inconsistent with the theory should be abandoned. I. AGREEMENTS WITHOUT THEORY 
Incompletely theorized agreements play a pervasive role in law and society. It is rare for a person, and especially for a group, to theorize any subject completely - that is, to accept both a highly abstract theory and a series of steps that relate the theory to a concrete conclusion. In fact, people often reach incompletely theorized agreements on a general principle. Such agreements are incompletely theorized in the sense that people who accept the principle need not agree on what it entails in particular cases. People know that murder is wrong, but they disagree about abortion. They favor racial equality, but they are divided on affirmative action. Hence there is a familiar phenomenon of a comfortable and even emphatic agreement on a general principle, accompanied by sharp disagreement about particular cases.'6 
This sort of agreement is incompletely theorized in the sense that it is incompletely specified - a familiar phenomenon with constitutional provisions'7 and regulatory standards in administrative law. Incompletely specified agreements have distinctive social uses. They may permit acceptance of a general aspiration when people are unclear about what the aspiration means, and in this sense, they can maintain a measure of both stability and flexibility over time. At the same time, they can conceal the fact of large-scale social disagreement about particular cases. 
There is a second and quite different kind of incompletely theorized agreement. People may agree on a mid-level principle but disagree both about the more general theory that accounts for it and about outcomes in particular cases. They may believe that government cannot discriminate on the basis of race, without settling on a large-scale theory of equality, and without agreeing whether government may enact affirmative action programs or segregate prisons when racial tensions are severe. The connections are left unclear, either in people's minds or in authoritative public documents, between the midlevel principle and general theory; the connection is equally unclear between the mid-level principle and concrete cases. So too, people may think that government may not regulate speech unless it can show a clear and present danger, but fail to settle whether this principle is founded in utilitarian or Kantian considerations, and disagree about whether the principle allows government to regulate a particular speech by members of the Ku Klux Klan. 
16 For a valuable discussion, see Henry S. Richardson, Specifying Norms as a Wayto Resolve Concrete Ethical Problems, I9 PHIL. & PUB. AFF. 279, 306 (i990). 
17 Thus, such terms as "equality"and "freedom"are "essentiallycontested"in the sense made famous by W.B. Gallie, Essentially Contested Concepts, 56 PRoc. ARISTOTELIASNOC'Y I67 (I955-56). 
My special interest here is in a third kind of phenomenon - incompletely theorized agreements on particular outcomes, accompanied by agreements on the low-level principles that account for them. These terms contain some ambiguities. There is no algorithm by which to distinguish between a high-level theory and one that operates at an intermediate or low level. We might consider Kantianism and utilitarianism as conspicuous examples of high-level theories and see legal illustrations in the many (academic) efforts to understand such areas as tort law, contract law, free speech, and the law of equality to be undergirded by highly abstract theories of the right or the good.'8 By contrast, we might think of low-level principles as including most of the ordinary material of legal doctrine - the general class of principles and justifications that are not said to derive from any particular large theories of the right or the good, that have ambiguous relations to large theories, and that are compatible with more than one such theory.'9 
By the term "particularoutcome," I mean the judgment about who wins and who loses a case. By the term "low-level principles," I refer to something relative, not absolute; a principle is low-level only when compared to more abstract alternatives. I also mean the terms "theories" and "abstractions" (which I use interchangeably) in a relative sense: the notions "low-level,""high-level,"and "abstract"are best understood as comparative, like the terms "big" and "unusual." The "clear and present danger" test is abstract when compared with the judgment that members of the Nazi Party may march in Skokie, Illinois,20 but the test is relatively particular when compared with the constitutional abstraction "freedom of speech." The idea of "freedom of speech" is relatively abstract when measured against the notion that campaign finance laws are acceptable, but the same idea is less abstract than the grounds that justify free speech, such as the principle of autonomy.21 The notion of a completely theorized judgment can be understood in the abstract: it refers to a judgment on a particular set of facts combined with all relevant vertical and horizontal judgments, as in a judgment in a free speech case accompanied by an understanding of all other free speech cases, or perhaps of all cases, and of all principles, at all levels of generality, that explain or justify that judgment. 
What I am emphasizing here is that when people diverge on some (relatively) high-level proposition, they might be able to agree if they 18 See, e.g., Thomas Scanlon, A Theory of Freedom of Expression, i PHIL. & PUB. AFF. 204 (I972); DWORKIN,supra note I5, at 407-I0 (i986); CHARLESFRIED, CONTRACTAs PROMISE 7-8 (I98I). 
19 See JOSEPH RAZ, On the Autonomy of Legal Reasoning, in ETHICS IN THE PUBLIC DoMAIN, supra note 4, at 3I0, 314-24 (1994) (discussing doctrine and the autonomy of law). 20 See Collin v. Smith, 578 F.2d II97, I202-03 (7th Cir. I978). 21 See Scanlon, supra note i8, at 2I5-20. lower the level of abstraction. People are sometimes able to converge on a point of less generality than the point at which agreement is difficult or impossible. In law, the point of agreement is often highly particularized - absolutely as well as relatively - in the sense that it involves a specific outcome and a set of reasons that typically do not venture far from the case at hand. 
As I have said, reasons are, by their very nature, more abstract than the outcome for which they account. In analogical thinking, a judge cannot go from one particular to another; it is necessary to identify a principle or a reason to unify or separate the particulars. To the extent that law prizes reason-giving, it contains an impulse toward abstraction. Full particularity is rare.22 What I am emphasizing is the lawyer's impulse to offer reasons on which people can unite from widely diverse foundations. 
Perhaps the participants in law endorse no high-level theory, or perhaps they believe that no such theory is yet available. Perhaps they find theoretical disputes irrelevant, confusing, or annoying. Perhaps they think that it is unnecessary to select a theory, because a certain outcome follows whatever theory they choose. Perhaps they disagree with one another as they enter into high-level debates. What is critical is that they agree on how a case must come out and on a low-level justification. 
The argument emphatically applies to legal rules, whether set down by judges, legislators, or administrators. Legal rules are typically incompletely theorized in the sense that they can be accepted by people who disagree on many general issues. People may agree that a sixty-five mile-per-hour speed limit makes sense, and that it applies to defendant Jones, without having much of a theory about criminal punishment, and without making judgments about the domain of utilitarianism and the scope of paternalism. A key social function of rules is to allow people to agree on the meaning, authority, and even the soundness of a governing legal provision in the face of disagreements about much else.23 Much the same can be said about other devices found in the legal culture, including standards, factors, and emphatically analogical reasoning.24 Indeed, all of the lawyer's conventional 22 See infra section II.C. 
23 See JOSEPH RAZ,THE MORALITY OF FREEDOM 58 (I986) ("[T]he practice [of proceeding through the mediation of rules] allows the creation of a pluralistic culture. For it enables people to unite in support of some 'low or medium level' generalizationsdespite profound disagreements concerning their ultimate foundations, which some seek in religion, others in Marxism or in Liberalism, etc.'). 
24 I discuss the latter in Cass R Sunstein, On Analogical Reasoning, io6 HARV. L. REV. 74I passim(I993). tools can allow the achievement of incompletely theorized agreements on particular outcomes, though in interestingly different ways.25 
It should now be clear that I am especially concerned with the use of ambitious thinking to produce "depth"- full accounts of the foundations of a decision, in the form of attempts to find ever deeper reasons behind the outcome. Incompletely theorized agreements do not offer such accounts. But such agreements also fail along the dimension of "width" - that is, they do not try to rationalize the law by showing how an outcome in one case fits coherently with particular outcomes in the full range of other cases. Judges, of course, attempt to produce local coherence, especially through reasoning by analogy. But they do not try for global coherence. 
B. 
It seems clear that people may converge on a correct outcome even though they do not have a full account for their judgments. Jones may know that dropped objects fall, that bee stings hurt, and that snow melts, without knowing exactly why these facts are true. Much the same is true for law and morality. Johnson may know that slavery is wrong, that government may not stop political protests, and that every person should have just one vote, without knowing exactly why these things are so. Judge Wilson may know that under the Constitution, discrimination against the handicapped is generally permitted, and that discrimination against women is generally banned, without having an account of why the Constitution is so understood. We may thus offer an epistemological point: people can know that X is true without entirely knowing why X is true. This is very often so for particular conclusions about law. 
There is a political point as well. People can agree on individual judgments even if they disagree on general theory. Diverse judges may agree that Roe v. Wade26should not be overruled, though the reasons that lead each of them to that conclusion sharply diverge. Perhaps the judges have different large-scale theories and can agree only on a low-level principle. Perhaps some of the judges have not developed ambitious accounts of the relevant area of the law at all. Thus some people emphasize that the Court should respect its own precedents; others think that Roe was rightly decided as a way of protecting women's equality; others think that the case was rightly decided as a way of protecting privacy; others think that the case has everything to do with state neutrality toward religion; others think that restrictions on abortion are unlikely to protect fetuses, and so the 25 I emphasize"can"ratherthan"will."Analogiesare frequentlydisputed,and peopleoften disagreeon the meaningof a standard("unreasonabrleisk,""discriminationa,"nd so forth). 
26 4I0 U.S. II3 (1973). On the refusalto overruleRoe, see PlannedParenthoodv. Casey,II2 S. Ct. 279I, 2804 (I992). case rightly reflects the fact that any regulation of abortion would be ineffective in promoting its own purposes. We can find incompletely theorized political agreements on particular outcomes in many areas of law and politics - on both sides of the affirmative action controversy, both sides of the dispute over the death penalty, and in all facets of the debate over health care reform. 
There are two especially important methods by which law might resolve disputes without obtaining agreement on first principles: rules and analogies. Both of these methods attempt to promote a major goal of a heterogeneous society: to make it possible to obtain agreement where agreement is necessary, and to make it unnecessary to obtain agreement where agreement is impossible. 
For purposes of law, reliance on rules might be incompletely theorized in three different ways. People might agree that rules are binding without having a full or agreed-upon account of why this is so. They can often agree on what rules mean even when they agree on very little else.27 They can even agree that certain rules are good without agreeing on exactly why they are good. And in the face of persistent disagreement or uncertainty about what morality generally requires, people can sometimes reason about particular cases by reference to analogies. They point to cases in which their judgments are firm, and proceed from those firm judgments to the more difficult ones. From different foundations, they may be able to agree on the plausibility of an analogical claim because they share a judgment about a governing low-level principle in the face of disagreement about the abstractions underlying that principle. 
We might consider, in this regard, Justice Stephen Breyer's discussion of one of the key compromises reached by the seven members of the United States Sentencing Commission.28 As Justice Breyer describes it, a central issue was how to proceed in the face of disparate theoretical commitments. Some people asked the Commission to follow an approach to punishment based on "just deserts" - an approach that would rank criminal conduct in terms of severity. But different commissioners had different views about how different crimes should be ranked, and a rational system was unlikely to follow from a collaborative ranking effort. Other people urged the Commission to use a model of deterrence. There was, however, no empirical evidence to link detailed variations in punishment to prevention of crime. 
27 Of course, substantive disagreements may break out during interpretation. See FREDERICK SCHAUER, PLAYING BY THE RULES 207-28 (I99I); Cass R. Sunstein, Problems with Rules, 83 CAL. L. REv. (forthcoming July I995). 
28 See Stephen G. Breyer, The Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Key Compromisesupon Which They Rest, I7 HOFSTRA L. REv. I, I5-I8 (I988). Though Justice Breyer does not stress the point, it seems clear that the seven members of the Commission were unlikely to agree that deterrence provides a full account of the aims of criminal sentencing.29 
In these circumstances, what route did the Commission follow? In fact, the Commission adopted no general view about the appropriate aims of criminal sentencing. Instead, the Commission adopted a rule - one founded on precedent: "It decided to base the Guidelines primarily upon typical, or average, actual past practice."30The Commission reached an incompletely theorized agreement on the value of starting (and usually ending) with past averages. Hence unusual judicial sentences would be filtered out through adoption of typical or average practices. Consciously articulated explanations, involving lowlevel reasons, were used to support particular departures from the past. Justice Breyer saw this effort as a necessary means of obtaining agreement and rationality within a multimember body charged with avoiding unjustifiably wide variations in sentencing.31 
The example suggests a quite general point. Through both analogies and rules, it is often possible to achieve convergence on particular disputes without resolving large-scale issues of the right or the good. For judges and officials at least, this is an important virtue. 
The fact that we can obtain an agreement of this sort - about the usefulness and meaning of a rule or the existence of a sound analogy - is no guarantee of a good outcome, whatever may be our criteria for deciding whether an outcome is good. The fact that there is agreement about a rule does not mean that the rule is desirable. Perhaps the rule is bad, or perhaps the judgments that go into its interpretation are bad. The resolution of the Sentencing Commission deserves approval only if average practices were not pervasively unjust. Perhaps the Sentencing Commission incorporated judgments that were based on ignorance, confusion, or prejudice.32 Perhaps a more deeply theorized approach would have produced better guidelines.33 
Some of the same things may be said about analogies. People in positions of authority may agree that a ban on same-sex marriages is analogous to a ban on marriages between uncles and nieces. But the analogy may be misconceived because there are relevant differences, because the similarities are far from decisive, or because the principle that accounts for the judgment of similarity cannot be sustained. The fact that people agree that case A is analogous to case B does not 29 See id. at I7. 30 Id. 31 See id. at i8; supra p. I733. 
32 For arguments to this effect, see Albert W. Alschuler, The Failure of Sentencing Guidelines: A Plea for Less Aggregation, 58 U. CHI. L. REV. 90I, 905-07 (i99i); Daniel J. Freed, Federal Sentencing in the Wakeof Guidelines: UnacceptableLimits on the Discretion of Sentencers, IOI YALE L.J. i68i, 1703-05 (I992). 
33 I do not discuss the choice between rules and rulelessness here. mean that case A or case B is rightly decided. Problems with analogies and low-level principles might lead us to be more ambitious. Participants in law may well be pushed in the direction of general theory - and toward broader and more ambitious claims - precisely because low-level reasoning offers an inadequate and incompletely theorized account of relevant similarities or relevant differences. 
All this should be sufficient to show that the virtues of incompletely theorized outcomes - and the virtues of decisions by rule and by analogy - are partial. Those virtues should not be exaggerated, and sometimes participants will have to raise the theoretical stakes. But no system of law is likely to be either just or efficient if it dispenses with incompletely theorized agreements. In fact, it is not likely even to be feasible. 
II. JUSTIFICATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS 
What might be said on behalf of incompletely theorized agreements, or incompletely theorized judgments, about particular cases? As I have indicated, incompletely theorized agreements may be unjust or otherwise wrong. Indeed, we are accustomed to thinking of incomplete theorization as reflective of some important problem or defect. When people theorize by raising the level of abstraction, they do so to reveal bias, or confusion, or inconsistency. Surely participants in a legal system should not abandon this effort. 
There is a good deal of truth in these usual thoughts, but they are not the whole story. On the contrary, incompletely theorized judgments are an important and valuable part of both private and public life.34 My principal concern is how judges on a multimember body should justify their opinions in public; the argument therefore has a great deal to do with the problem of collective choice. But some of the relevant points bear on other issues as well. They have implications for the question of how an individual judge not faced with the problem of producing a majority opinion - a judge on a district court, for example - might write; they bear also on the question of how a single judge, whether or not a member of a collective body, might think in private as well as write for the public; and they relate to appropriate methods of both thought and justification wholly outside of the adjudicative setting. I will say more about these issues below. 
34 I have discussedsome of these pointsin the specificcontextof analogicalthinking. See Sunstein,supra note 24. I try hereto broadenand generalizethe discussionand also to correct some ambiguitiesand errorsin that discussion. 
I. Multimember Institutions. - I begin with the special problem of public justification faced by a multimember body. The first and most obvious point is that incompletely theorized agreements are well suited to a world - especially a legal world - containing social disagreement on large-scale issues. By definition, such agreements have the large advantage of allowing a convergence on particular outcomes by people unable to reach anything like an accord on general principles. This advantage is associated not only with the simple need to decide cases but also with social stability, which could not exist if fundamental disagreements broke out in every case of public or private dispute.35 
Second, incompletely theorized agreements can promote two goals of a liberal democracy and a liberal legal system: to enable people to live together,36and to permit them to show each other a measure of reciprocity and mutual respect.37 The use of rules or low-level principles allows judges on multimember bodies and hence citizens generally to find commonality - and a common way of life - without producing unnecessary antagonism. Perhaps more important, incompletely theorized agreements allow people to show each other a high degree of mutual respect, civility, or reciprocity. Ordinary people frequently disagree in some deep way on an issue - the Middle East, pornography, gay marriages - and sometimes they agree not to discuss that issue much, as a way of deferring to each other's strong convictions (even if they do not at all respect the particular conviction that is at stake).38 If reciprocity and mutual respect are desirable, it follows that judges, perhaps even more than ordinary people, should not challenge a litigant's or one another's deepest and most defining commitments, at 35 The institutionof the concurringopinionshowsthatjudgessometimesrejecta colleague's low-leveljustificationp,erhapsbecausethey acceptthe resultbut would prefera differentlowlevel justificationp,erhapsbecausethey would prefera lower-levelor higher-leveljustification.

37 See RAWLS, supra note 4, at I6-17 ("[T]heidea of reciprocitylies betweenthe idea of impartialityw,hichis altruistic[,.].. and the ideaof mutualadvantageunderstoodas everyone's being advantagedwith respectto each person'spresentor expectedfuturesituationas things are."). 
38 Cf Stephen Holmes, Gag Rules or the Politics of Omission, in CONSTITUTIONALISM AND DEMOCRACYI9 passim(JonElster& RuneSlagstadeds., i988) (discussingrulesdesignedto prevent discussionof issuesthat paralyzepoliticalparticipants). least if those commitments are reasonable and if there is no need for them to do so. Thus, it would be better if judges intending to reaffirm Roe v. Wade could do so without challenging the belief that the fetus is a human being,39 or if judges seeking to invalidate the death penalty could do so without saying that the punishment of death is invalid because of its sheer brutality.40 
Institutional arguments in law, especially those involving judicial restraint, are typically designed to bracket fundamental questions and remove them from the realm of the judiciary.41 The allocation of certain roles has the important function of allowing outcomes to be reached without forcing courts to make decisions on fundamental issues.42 Those issues are resolved by reference to institutional competence, not on their merits.43 
To be sure, some fundamental commitments might appropriately be challenged in the legal system or within other multimember bodies. Some such commitments are ruled off-limits by the authoritative legal materials. Many provisions involving basic rights have this function.44 Of course, it is not always disrespectful to disagree with someone in a fundamental way; on the contrary, such disagreements may reflect profound respect. For example, objections to judgments based on prejudice may reflect respect for the person at the same time that they attempt to overcome the judgments at issue. When defining commitments are based on demonstrable errors of fact or logic, it is appropriate to contest them. The same is true when those commitments are rooted in a rejection of the basic dignity of all human beings, or when it is necessary to undertake the contest to resolve a genuine problem.45 But many cases can be resolved in an incompletely theorized way, and that is all I am suggesting here.

40 This is the goal of the argument that the death penalty is invalid because it is arbitrary in its application. See Callins v. Collins, II4 S. Ct. II27, II29-30 (I994) (Blackmun, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari);Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420, 437-40 (I980) (Marshall, J., concurring in the judgment). 
41 See, e.g., Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 326 (i98o) ("It is not the mission of this court or any other to decide whether the balance of competing interests reflected in the Hyde Amendment is wise social policy.'). 
42 See DON HERZOG, HAPPY SLAVESII2 (i989) (?[Jludgemsustsimplyignorea hostof politically charged facts."). 
43 This is part of the legal process tradition. See William N. Eskridge, Jr., & Philip P. Frickey, The Making of The Legal Process, I07 HARV. L. REV. 203I, 2037-38 (I994). The merits are thus excluded as a reason for action. For a general discussion of exclusionary reasons, see JOSEPH RAz,PRACTICALREASON AND NORMS 73-76 (2d ed. I990). 
44 See, e.g., U.S. CONST. amend.XIII. 
45 Cf RAWLSs,upra note 4, at 4 (discussing reasonable pluralism); see also Hampton, supra note 4, at 292-3I2 (respondingto Rawls). not we are dealing with a multimember body. The first consideration here is that any simple general theory of a large area of the law free speech, contracts, property - is likely to be too crude to fit with the best understandings of the multiple values that are at stake in that area. Monistic theories of free speech or property rights, for example, fail to accommodate the range of values that speech and property implicate. Human goods are plural and diverse, and they cannot be ranked along any unitary scale without doing violence to our understanding of the qualitative differences among those very goods.46 People value things not just in terms of weight but also in qualitatively different ways. In the area of free speech, a simple top-down theory - stressing, for example, autonomy or democracy - is likely to run afoul of powerful judgments about particular cases. For this reason, monistic theories are usually inadequate.47 
Of course, a "top-down" approach might reject monism and point to plural values.48 But any such approach is likely to owe its genesis and its proof - its point or points - to a range of particular cases, and considered judgments about particular cases, on which it can build. Top-down approaches based on plural values may seem convincing, but incompletely theorized judgments are well suited to a moral universe that is diverse and pluralistic, not only in the sense that people disagree, but also in the sense that each of us is attuned to pluralism when we are thinking well about any area of law.49 
Second, incompletely theorized agreements serve the crucial function of reducing the political cost of enduring disagreements. If judges disavow large-scale theories, then losers in particular cases lose much less. They lose a decision but not the world. They may win on another occasion. Their own theory has not been rejected or ruled inadmissible. When the authoritative rationale for the result is disconnected from abstract theories of the good or the right, the losers can submit to legal obligations, even if reluctantly, without being forced to renounce their deepest ideals. To be sure, some theories should be rejected or ruled inadmissible; this is sometimes the point of authoritative legal materials. But it is an advantage, from the stand46 See ELIZABETH ANDERSON, VALUE IN ETHICS AND ECONOMICS55-59 (1993); Amartya Sen, Plural Utility, 8I PRoC.ARISTOTELIANSOC'Y 193, 193-210 (1981); Cass R. Sunstein, Incommensurability and Valuation in Law, 92 MICH. L. REV. 779, 795-8I2 (1994). 
47 See T.M. Scanlon, Jr., Freedom of Expression and Categoriesof Expression, 40 U. PITT. L. REV. 519, 5I9-20 (1979) (rejecting autonomy theory as a full account). Analogical reasoning is especially desirable here. This way of thinking allows judges and lawyers to build doctrine with close reference to particularcases and thus with close attention to the plurality of values that may well arise. This plurality will confound "top-down"theories that attempt, for example, to understand speech only in terms of democracy, or property only in terms of economic efficiency. 
48 See, e.g., AMARTYASEN, COMMODITIESAND CAPABILITIES33-37 (I985); Sen, supra note 46, at 199-204. 
49 See JOSEPH RAz, The Relevance of Coherence, in ETHICS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN, supra note 4, at 298-303 [hereinafterRAz, Relewnce of Coherence](discussing pluralism and coherence). point of freedom and stability, for a legal system to be able to tell most losers - many of whom are operating from foundations that have something to offer, or that cannot be ruled out a priori - that their own deepest convictions may play a role elsewhere in the law. 
The third point is that incompletely theorized agreements may be valuable when what is sought is moral evolution over time. Consider the area of constitutional equality, where considerable change has occurred in the past and is likely to occur in the future. A completely theorized judgment - at least if it takes rule-like form - would be unable to accommodate changes in facts or values.50 Incompletely theorized agreements are a key to debates over constitutional equality, which raise issues about whether gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, and other characteristics are analogous to race. Incompletely theorized agreements have the important advantage of allowing a large degree of openness to new facts and perspectives. At one point, we might think that homosexual relations are akin to incest; at another point, we might find the analogy bizarre. A completely theorized judgment would, of course, have many virtues if it were correct. But at any particular moment in time, this is an unlikely prospect for human beings, including judges, in constitutional law or elsewhere.51 
Fourth, incompletely theorized agreements may be the best approach available for people with limited time and capacities. The search for full theorization may be simply too difficult for participants in law to complete, and so too for others attempting to reason through difficult problems. A single judge faces this problem as much as a member of a multimember panel. In this respect, the principle of stare decisis is crucial: attention to precedent is liberating, not merely confining, since it is far easier for judges to decide cases if they can take much law as settled. The rule of precedent thus assists in the process of obtaining agreements among people who disagree on first principles. Indeed, precedents can lower the level of theorization by making more foundational views irrelevant or even inappropriate52and by binding judges to outcomes that they would like to reject.53 In any event, incompletely theorized agreements have the advantage, for ordinary lawyers and judges, of humility and modesty: they allow past judgments to be treated as given and make it unnecessary to create the law anew in each case. 
50 I am assumingherethat completetheorizationresultsin fixedrulesratherthanprinciples whoseapplicationcan changeovertime. An agreemenotn an abstractionwouldnot createfixity if the abstractionwere indeterminatoer capableof new meaningsin new contexts. 
51 Rawlssays that,in all cases,the "strugglefor reflectiveequilibriumcontinuesindefinitely." RAWLS, supra note 4, at 97. 
52 See PlannedParenthoodv. Casey,II2 S. Ct 279I, 2806-II (I992) (usingstaredecisisto avoid new judgmenton meritsof abortionright). 
53 See AntoninScalia,The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56 U. CHi.L. REV. II75, II77-80 (I989) (discussingvirtuesof rules). 
Fifth, and finally, incompletely theorized agreements are well adapted to a system that should or must take precedents as fixed points. This is a large advantage over more ambitious methods, since ambitious thinkers, in order to reach horizontal and vertical coherence, will probably be forced to disregard many decided cases. In light of the sheer number of adjudicative officials, law cannot speak with one voice; full coherence in principle is unlikely in the extreme." The area of contract law is unlikely to cohere with the field of tort law, or property law; contract law is itself likely to contain multiple and sometimes inconsistent strands. Multiple and sometimes inconsistent strands are a natural outgrowth of incompletely theorized agreements, which are themselves a way of minimizing the extent and depth of conffict. To be sure, the existence of such agreements may increase conffict by virtue of inconsistency. 
It is important, then, that analogical thinkers and rule-followers usually take precedents as given even if they disagree with those precedents as a matter of first principle. The fact that precedents are fixed points helps to bring about incompletely theorized agreements as well, by constraining the areas of reasonable disagreement. The result is a degree of stability and predictability that are important virtues for law. 
We can find many examples in ordinary life. Parents' practices with their children may not fully cohere. Precedents with respect to bedtime, eating, homework, and much else are unlikely to be susceptible to systematization under a single principle. Of course parents do not seek to be inconsistent - of course a child may justly feel aggrieved if his sibling is allowed to watch more hours of television for no good reason - but full coherence would be a lot to ask. The problem of reaching full consistency is much more severe in law, where so many people have decided so many things, and where disagreements on large principles lurk in the background. We need not say this with regret. 
None of these points suggests that incompletely theorized agreements always deserve celebration. The virtues of such agreements are partial. If an agreement is more fully theorized, it may provide greater notice to affected parties, at least if the fuller theorization yields rulelike judgments about a wide range of cases.55 Moreover, fuller theorization - in the form of wider and deeper inquiry into the grounds for legal judgment - may be valuable or even necessary to prevent inconsistency, bias, or self-interest. We should be wary of judicial out54 The point countsagainstDworkin'sHerculesmetaphors,ee DWORKIsNu,pra note I5, at 239-40, and also against efforts to find an analogy between legal reasoning and the search for reflectiveequilibrium. 
55 See Scalia, supra note 53, at II77-80; cf Sunstein, supra note 27 (criticizing extravagant enthusiasmfor rules). comes based on grounds that have not been stated publicly. If judges on a panel have actually agreed on a general theory, and if they are truly committed to it, they should say so (even if, for reasons I have suggested, they should usually be reluctant to commit). Judges and the general community will learn much more if they are able to discuss the true motivating grounds for outcomes. All these are valid considerations, and nothing I am saying here denies their importance. 
There is an association between the effort to attain incompletely theorized agreements and the rule of law ideal. Insofar as our system prizes rule by law rather than rule by individual human beings, it tries to constrain judgments before particular decisions are made. Indeed, a prime purpose of the rule of law is to rule off limits certain deep ideas of the right or the good, at least in the sense that those ideas ought not to be invoked by officials occupying particular social roles.56 Among the forbidden or presumptively forbidden ideas are, often, high-level views that are taken as too hubristic or sectarian for judges precisely because they are so high-level. The presumption against high-level theories is an aspect of the ideal of the rule of law to the extent that it is an effort to limit the exercise of judicial discretion at the point of application. 
In this way, we might begin to make distinctions between the role of high theory in the courtroom and the role of high theory in the political branches; these distinctions are central to the claims I am making here. In democratic arenas, there is no taboo, presumptive or otherwise, against invoking high-level theories of the good or the right.57 Such theories have played a role in many social movements with defining effects on American constitutionalism, including the Civil War, the New Deal, the women's movement, the civil rights movement, and the environmental movement.58 Many of the most ab56 See HERZOG, supra note 42, at II0-47 (connecting the law-politics distinction with the need to distinguish between the sphere of adjudication and the sphere of legislation). 
57 I am putting to one side the questions raised by "comprehensiveviews." See RAWLSs,upra note 4, at 13-I4, I75. 
58 See BRUCE ACKERMAN,WE THE PEOPLE 44-8o (i99i). It mightbe respondedthat there are many cases in which high principle was invoked judicially - consider, for example, the fairly dramatic and rapid shift in the treatment of sex equality. See GEOFFREY R. STONE, Louis M. SEIDMAN, CASSR. SUNSTEIN & MARKV. TUSHNET, CONSTITUTIONALLAW 676-7I8 (2d ed. I99I). In cases of this sort, the Court does use principles of a relatively high-level, even if it thinks analogically. High-level arguments can certainly be found in some important constitutional cases, including, for example, DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep't of Social Servs., 489 U.S. I89 (I989), in which the Court accepted a large-scale view of the state as "passive"rather than "affirmative." See id. at I95-97. Note, however, that the Court, in invoking theories, is usually likely to be following democratic trends rather than initiating new ones, and indeed, in the area of sex discrimination, the Court was building self-consciously on democratic developments. See, e.g., Frontiero v. Richardson, 4II U.S. 677, 687-88 (I973). It is notable, too, that the Court was also stract arguments of high principle have come from participants in deliberative democracy - James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rachel Carson.59 To be sure, incompletely theorized agreements play a key role in democratic arenas too; consider laws that are supportable by reference to diverse foundations, such as those protecting endangered species or granting unions a right to organize. But high-level theories are an indispensable part of democratic politics. 
By contrast, use of large-scale theories by courts is usually problematic and understood as such, within the judiciary (as exemplified by judicial practice) if not within law schools. The skepticism is partly a result of the simple fact that judges who invoke large-scale theories may have to require large-scale social reforms, and courts are usually ineffective at implementing such reforms on their own.60 An important part of the problem lies in the fact that courts, in common law or constitutional cases, must decide on the legitimacy of rules that are aspects of complex systems. In invalidating or changing a single rule, courts may produce unfortunate systemic effects that are not visible to them at the time of decision and that may be impossible for them to correct thereafter.6' Legislatures are in a much better position on this score. 
For those who believe that the Warren Court provides an enduring model for American constitutionalism, this cautionary note may be inadequate; perhaps courts can take important steps in producing justice where there is now injustice, and perhaps a degree of theoretical abstraction is necessary for them to perform this role. Even if this is so, constitutional law is only a small part of adjudication, not the whole picture, and in any case, a degree of social reform in the name of the Constitution might be produced through judgments that are not completely theorized.62 Moreover, constitutional courts are unlikely to want to produce large-scale social change; the mode of selecting reluctant to develop a theory to account for its new approach to sex equality, but relied instead on a set of relevant factors. See id. at 682-87. (I am grateful to Susan Moller Okin for raising this issue.) 
59 Carson is probably the most contentious example on this list, but her book was in many ways the foundation of the environmental movement. See RACHEL CARSON, SILENT SPRING 277-97 (I962); Averting a Death Foretold, NEWSWEEK, Nov. 28, I994, at 72, 72-73. 
60 See GERALD N. ROSENBERG, THE HOLLOW HOPE: CAN COURTS BRING ABOUT SOCIAL CHANGE?, 5-7, 336-38, 342-43 (I99I) (discussing problems in judge-led reform). 
61 Examples are offered in R. SHEP MELNICK, REGULATION AND THE COURTS:THE CASE OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT II0-I2, I76-78, I90-92 (1983), and DONALDL. HOROWITZ,THE COURTS ANDSOCIALPOLICY260-73 (1977). The point is described from the theoretical point of view in Lon L. Fuller, The Forms and Limits of Adjudication, 92 HARV.L. REv. 353, 393-405 (1978), and JOSEPH RAz, The Inner Logic of the Law, in ETHICS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN, cited above in note 4, at 222, 222-25. 
62 See Sunstein, supra note 24, at 767-69, 780-82 (claiming that analogy and low-level principles need not be conservative). judges, and American history itself, suggest that courts will rarely attempt to replicate the Warren Court's role. And judges who use such theories may well blunder. Judges are not trained as political philosophers, and in many cases, use of abstractions not developed by close reference to particular problems has led to major mistakes.63 
Even more fundamentally, judges lack a democratic pedigree, and it is in the absence of such a pedigree that the system of precedent, analogy, and incompletely theorized agreement has such an important place. The right to a democratic system is one of the rights to which people are entitled, and in such a system, judicial invocation of large theories to support large decisions against democratic processes should be a rare event.64 To be sure, judges have a duty to interpret the Constitution, and that duty authorizes them to invoke relatively largescale principles, seen as part and parcel of the Constitution as democratically ratified. Many people think that judicial activity is best characterized by reference to use of such principles,65and it would be wrong to deny that there are occasions on which this practice occurs and is legitimate. 
To identify those occasions, it would be necessary to develop a full theory of legal interpretation. For present purposes, I urge something more modest. Most judicial activity does not involve constitutional interpretation, and the ordinary work of common law decision and statutory interpretation calls for low-level principles. Indeed, constitutional argument is itself based largely on low-level principles, not on high theory, except on those rare occasions when more ambitious thinking becomes necessary to resolve a case, or when the case for the ambitious theory is so insistent that a range of judges do and should converge on it.66 
At this point, it should be remarked that incompletely theorized agreements are not necessarily conservative, and it would therefore be 63 Consider the large-scale reference to the passive state in DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep't of Social Servs., 489 U.S. I89, I95-97 (I989), a view that cannot withstand analysis in light of the role of the state in protecting property rights, contract rights, and rights of plaintiffs in certain settings. See David P. Currie, Positive and Negative Constitutional Rights, 53 U. CHI. L. REv. 864, 872-80, 886-87 (I986); David A. Strauss, Due Process, GovernmentInaction, and Private Wrongs, I989 SUP. CT. REV. 53, 72-76. 
64 Of course the point must be qualified by reference to the democratic failures of existing majoritarian arrangements. For variations on this theme, see JOHN H. ELY, DEMOCRACAYND DISTRUST I05-24 (I980), and CASS R. SUNSTEIN, THE PARTIALCONSTITUTION I33-53 (I993). 
65 This is the vision of judicial review in ACKERMANc,ited above in note 58, at 4, 38-39, I3I-32, 284. Note that it differs dramatically from the understanding in DWORKINc,ited above in note I5, at 355-99, in the sense that Ackerman insists that the large-scale principles have sources in actual judgments of "we the people." There is, however, a commonality between Ackerman and Dworkin in the sense that both see the use of such principles as a large part of the Court's work. It is along that dimension that I am doubting both of their accounts. 
66 See infra p. I766 (discussing the phenomenon of contested views becoming uncontested and vice versa). wrong to identify enthusiasm for such agreements with a belief in Burkeanism or traditionalism for law.67 Many incompletely theorized agreements are highly critical of existing social practices; consider the judgment that sex discrimination is unacceptable, a judgment that may rest on diverse theoretical foundations but at the same time lead to sharp challenges to many current social and legal practices. Whether incompletely theorized agreements produce approval or disapproval of existing practice depends on their content, not on the fact of their incomplete theorization.68 Of course, high-level theories need not be critical of current practices; many such theories are designed to defend them.69 
Reason-giving is usually prized in law, as of course it should be. Without reasons, there is no assurance that decisions are not arbitrary or irrational, and people will be less able to plan their affairs. 
In a few areas of law, however, institutions are permitted to operate with full particularity. People converge on the result, but they need offer no reasons for their decision.70 With full particularity, the judgment is not merely incompletely theorized; it is not theorized at all. In denying certiorari, for example, the Supreme Court is silent; in issuing verdicts, juries do not give reasons; college admissions offices produce results but rarely justifications. Each decision applies to the case at hand and to that case alone.71 Participants may actually have reasons but refuse to give them; or they may lack reasons in the sense that they are unable to articulate what accounts for their decision; or each of them, on a multimember institution, may have reasons but be unable to agree with one another about them, and hence they leave an outcome officially unexplained. In any of these cases, this approach 67 A formof Burkeanismis defendedin ANTHONYT.

JosephRaz defendsanalogyas responsiveto the possibleproblemsof "partiarleform"and henceas conservativein JOSEPH RAz, Law and Value in Adjudication, in THE AUTHORITYOF LAW I8o, 200-o6 (i979), but if the judgments of principle that underlie claims of analogy are critical of existing practice, there may be nothing conservative about analogy. See, e.g., Andrew Koppelman, Note, The Miscegenation Analogy: Sodomy Law as Sex Discrimination, 98 YALEL.J. 145, 147 (I988) (arguing that sodomy laws are invalid by analogy to the invalidation of miscegenation statutes in Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. I (I967)). 
69 Henry Sidgwick so understood utilitarianism, broadly speaking. See HENRY SIDGWICK, THE METHODSOFETHICS475-77 (Hackett Publishing 1981) (7th ed. 1907). Richard Posner uses economics to defend much of the common law. See POSNERs,upra note 15, at 23-25, 31-32, 251-64. 
70 I draw here on the illuminating discussion of full particularity in Frederick Schauer, Giving Reasons, 47 STAN.L. REV.(forthcoming 1995). 
71 See id. offers full particularity because, by their very nature, reasons are more abstract than the outcomes that they justify. Once offered publicly, reasons may therefore apply to cases that the court, in justifying a particular decision, does not have before it.72 This is why reason-giving promotes planning. Perhaps the most famous (or infamous) illustration of full particularity comes from Justice Stewart: 
I shallnot todayattemptfurtherto definethe kindsof materialI understand to be embracedwithin that shorthanddescription[of hard-core pornographya];nd perhapsI couldneversucceedin intelligiblydoingso. But I knowit whenI see it, and the motionpictureinvolvedin this case is not that.73 
All well-functioning legal systems value the enterprise of reasongiving. But there is a good reason to be wary of reason-giving: reasons may be both over- and under-inclusive. In this way, reasons are like rules, which are also over- and under-inclusive if measured by reference to their justifications.74 Whenever a court offers reasons, there is a risk of future regret - not simply because the court may be confined in a subsequent case and thus have to avoid inconsistency, but because the reasons offered in case A may turn out, on reflection, to generate a standard, a principle, or a rule that collides with the court's considered judgment about case B. The constraint produced by the reason may limit discretion and promote predictability, but it may also produce a bad result. 
The distinction between holding and dictum helps reduce this problem. Indeed, the distinction squarely addresses the problem of excessively theorized judgments, and it helps to ensure that legal decisions are incompletely theorized. If we understand the holding to be the narrowest possible basis for the decision, a subsequent court is able to offer sufficiently narrow reasons for the outcome in the previous case - that is, reasons that ensure that the outcome in the previous case does not apply to a case that is genuinely different. In initially giving a reason, court one may be unaware of possible applications that will falsify that reason because of its imprecision and excessive generality. But court two, able to offer some narrower and better-fitting explanation for the outcome, can eliminate the difficulty. It can label the excessive generality "dicta." 
There is another difficulty with reason-giving. One might sometimes know something without knowing the reasons for it. For exam72 ConsiderJohnDewey'srenditionof "theold storyof the laymanwho was appointedto a positionin India where he would have to pass in his officialcapacityon variousmattersin controversiesbetweennatives. Upon consultinga legal friend,he was told to use his commonsenseand announcehis decisionsfirmly;in the majorityof caseshis naturaldecisionas to what was fairand reasonablewouldsuffice. But, his friendadded:'Nevertryto give reasons,for they will usuallybe wrong.'"JohnDewey,Logical Method and Law, IO CORNELLL.Q. 17, 17 (I924). 73 Jacobellisv. Ohio,378 U.S. 184, I97 (I964)(Stewart,J., concurring). 74 See SCHAUERs,upra note 27, at 3-34. ple, one may know that this is Martin's face, and no other face, without knowing, exactly, why one knows that fact. Or one might know that a certain act would be wrong, without knowing, exactly, why it would be wrong. It is certainly possible to know that something is true without knowing why it is true. 
Is there an analogy in law? No simple answer would make sense. As I have suggested, a special quality of most legal systems is a presumptive requirement of reasons for legal outcomes. This requirement makes it hard to prize a capacity to know what the law is without knowing why it is as it is, or how a case should come out without knowing why it should come out that way. On the other hand, some people think that many of our judgments about similarity and dissimilarity - a key to legal reasoning - do not rest on reasons but instead simply constitute our descriptive and normative worlds.75 Conceiva-. bly, there is an aspect of socialization into law that enables people to see that case A is "like"case B, and not at all "like"case C, without always having much of an account of why this is so. 
More concretely, it is possible that experienced judges, like experienced lawyers, develop a faculty - best described as wisdom, perception, or judgment - that allows them to reach decisions very well and very quickly. This is a distinctive faculty. It seems to be associated with the ready and sympathetic apprehension of a wide range of diverse particulars and with an appreciation of the appropriate weight to be given to each.76 Certainly, we can imagine a class of people who have a wonderful capacity to tell whether one case is relevantly like another, or to decide who should win cases, but who lack much of a capacity to explain what underlies their ultimate judgments, or their convictions about relevant similarity and difference. They are not theorists at all. But they have a "good ear," unlike some others who have a "tin ear" for law. 
Perhaps it would ultimately be possible for such people (or at least outside observers) to explain what underlies these good apprehensions, but this may not be so. It is important not to mystify these issues. What is asserted to be a capacity for perception may in fact be a product of bias or confusion, and reason-giving helps diminish this risk. The faculty of wisdom, perception, or judgment probably 75 See MarkJohnson,Some Constraints on Embodied Analogical Understanding, in ANALOGIcAL REASONING 25, 39 (David H. Helmaned., I988)("[A]nalogiecsannotbe understoodas propositionalor conceptualmechanismsfor reflectingon already-determinaetxeperiencesr;ather,we can actuallyspeakof themas constitutive of our experienceb,ecausethey are partiallyconstitutive of our understandingo,ur mode of experiencingour world. Analogyis a basic meansby whichform,pattern,andconnectionemergein ourunderstandinagnd arethenarticulatedin our reflectivecognitionand in our language."). 
76 See KRONMAN, supra note 67, at 53-62 (describingthis skill as "statesmanship"se);e also JON ELSTER, SOUR GRAPES: STUDIES IN THE SUBVERSION OF RATIONALITY I6-I7 (I983) (discussing the existenceand importanceof this skill in professionsotherthan law). amounts to a capacity to think very quickly of a resolution that takes account of everything that matters, including a wide array of competing considerations, and that coheres well with the rest of our particular and general judgments. Compare this striking description of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt: 
FrancesPerkinslater describedthe President'sidea . . . as a "flashof almostclairvoyantknowledgeand understanding."He would have one of theseflasheseverynow and then,she observed,muchlike thosethat musiciansget when"theysee or hearthe structureof an entiresymphony or opera."He couldn'talwaysholdon to it or verbalizeit, but when it came, he suddenlyunderstoodhow all kinds of disparatethingsfit together.... Rooseveltmadeup for the defectsof an undisciplinedmind with a profoundabilityto integratea vast multitudeof details into a largerpatternthat gave shapeand directionto the streamof events.77 When someone is thought to be wise about particulars in law, it is because she is able to see how to resolve a case without doing violence to other judgments at the horizontal and vertical levels. She is thus able to decide cases, and to decide who wins and who loses, while minimally endangering other valued goods and goals. She may not be able to explain what underlies her decisions (though we should hope that she can). Something of this sort underlies the conviction that a person is "judicious,"and it helps explain why full-scale theorization is so rare in law. Of course, someone generally described as judicious might be wrong much of the time, and more ambitious theory might be introduced to show where the errors lie. 
Enthusiasm for incompletely theorized agreements meets with many adversaries. An especially distinguished example is Ronald Dworkin, who urges, at least as an ideal, a high degree of theoretical self-consciousness in adjudication.78 Dworkin argues that when lawyers disagree about what the law is, they are disagreeing about "the best constructive interpretation of the community's legal practice."79 Dworkin claims that interpretation in law consists of different efforts to make a governing text "the best it can be."80 This is Dworkin's conception of law as integrity. 
Dworkin's account appears to require judges to develop high-level theories, and it does not (to say the least) favor theoretical modesty. 77 DoRis K. GOODWIN, No ORDINARY TIME 193 (1994). 
78 I discuss some of these points in Sunstein, cited above in note 24, at 784-87, and I draw on that discussion here. My current goal is to generalize some of the points made in a very narrow context. 
79 DWORKIN, supra note I5, at 225. 80 Id. at 229. There is no presumption against abstraction. In his hands, the relevant theories are large and abstract; they sound like political philosophy or moral theory.8' These theories are derived from or brought to bear on particular problems. But this is not how real lawyers and real judges proceed. If they can, they avoid broad and abstract questions. 
Let us distinguish here among four situations: the individual judge thinking through a case on his own and sitting on a single-judge district court; the individual judge writing for a single-judge district court; the individual judge thinking through a case privately but also sitting on a multimember court; and the individual judge writing or participating in an opinion to be joined by members of a multimember institution. The constraints in the four situations are different. In all of them, the judge would probably prefer to decide a case knowing that the outcome and supporting rationale can be justified by reference to a range of diverse and more general theories. If so, it is unnecessary for the judge to choose among them; if so, the judge may put aside the more theoretical debates, knowing, for example, that whether he is a Kantian or a Benthamite - whether he cares about fairness or deterrence - someone who has assaulted another must pay compensation for the wrong done. 
Now it may be that some individual judges would like to think things through very deeply in order to be sure that they are right. There is certainly nothing wrong with an aspiration of this sort, though limits of time and capacity may make the aspiration unrealistic, and the system of precedent will complicate matters. But even the individual judge sitting on a single-judge court may be reluctant to set forth his preferred abstractions in public - on the theory that the judicial role calls for the avoidance of dicta, understood here as statements about the law that are not necessary to the decision. Perhaps the outcome can be justified on narrower grounds that involve more modest and more reliable principles and that are less likely to create problems for unforeseeable future cases. 
The point is even clearer for the participant on a multimember panel. To some extent, the avoidance of more abstract or theoretical claims stems from purely strategic or pragmatic considerations, as 81 See, e.g., id. at 403-04 (discussingtort law and equal protection).Dworkinwritesabout constitutionailnterpretation: 
The Constitutionis foundationaolf otherlaw, so Hercules'interpretatioonf the document as a whole,and of its abstractclauses,mustbe foundationaals well.... [.lt must be a justificationdrawnfromthe mostphilosophicarleachesof politicaltheory .... In constitutionaltheoryphilosophyis closerto the surfaceof the argumentand,if the theoryis good, explicitin it. 
Id. at 380. Theseare pointsthatI am denyinghere. In fact, Dworkin'saccountof the judicial rolesays verylittleaboutthe variousfact-findingand theory-buildinwg eaknessesof judges,who are afterall unelected,and aboutthe judges'own knowledgeof theirweaknesses,even though muchof judge-madelaw is basedon that knowledge.This seemsto me a majorgap in Dworkin's view. when individual judges on a multimember body have a highly abstract theory but are unable to persuade their colleagues to accept it.82 But often, the avoidance is not strategic in this way but stems instead from the fact that highly abstract questions can be too hard, large, and open-ended for legal actors to handle. Members of a multimember panel may especially fear that any responses will go wrong when tested against concrete cases not before the court, will be too sectarian and hubristic, and will take too long to offer, because they are too deeply theorized. On multimember bodies, efforts to answer such abstract questions can prevent people who disagree on large principles from reaching consensus on particular outcomes when, in fact, those outcomes, and low-level explanations, could command agreement from a variety of perspectives. 
Because of his enthusiasm for abstractions, Hercules - Dworkin's patient and resourceful judge - could not really participate in ordinary judicial deliberations. He would probably be seen as a usurper, even an oddball. On a single judge court, he would suffer from the vice of hubris. On a multimember panel, he would lack some of the crucial virtues of a participant in legal deliberation. These virtues include collegiality and civility, which incline judges toward the lowest level of abstraction necessary to decide a case.83 
Dworkin anticipates an objection of this kind. He notes that it might be paralyzing for judges to seek a general theory for each area of law, and he acknowledges that Hercules is more methodical than any real-world judge can be.84 But Hercules, in Dworkin's view, "shows us the hidden structure of [ordinary] judgments and so lays these open to study and criticism."85 Of course, Hercules aims at a "comprehensive theory"of each area of law, while ordinary judges, unable to consider all lines of inquiry, must seek a theory that is "par82 If the judge has thought the relevant issues through in an ambitious way and made the moral judgments that are raised by the issue (to the extent that they are legally relevant), we may have more assurance that the process of adjudication is reliable, in the sense that it is likely to lead to results that are just. What I am emphasizing is that the judge might sign an opinion that contains a more modest account. 
83 I should say that I do not know to what extent this counts as a criticism of Dworkin, since Dworkin presents Hercules as a thought experiment, and it is unclear to what extent Hercules' approach is supposed to be an ideal for real-world judges. To my knowledge, Dworkin has not discussed the question of appropriate levels of abstraction in legal justification. But see supra note 8I (noting Dworkin's suggestion that, in constitutional law, the relevant justification is "drawn from the most philosophical reaches of political theory"). 
84 See DWORKINs,upra note I5, at 264-65; see also id. at 380I8I (referring to the need "to gain the votes of other justices and to make their joint decision sufficiently acceptable to the community so that it can continue to act in the spirit of a community of principle at the constitutional level"). 
85 Id. at 265. tial." But Hercules' "judgments of fit and political morality are made on the same material and have the same character as theirs."86 
It is these points that I am denying here. The decisions of ordinary judges are based on different material and have a different character. They are less deeply theorized not only because of limits of time and capacity, but also because of the distinctive morality of judging in a pluralistic society. I will qualify this claim below.87 But for the moment, I suggest that the ordinary judge is no Hercules with less time on his hands, but a different sort of figure altogether. 
B. 
Borrowing from Henry Sidgwick's suggestions about method in ethics,88 advocates of ambitious thinking might respond in the following way. There is often good reason for judges to raise the level of abstraction and ultimately to resort to large-scale theory. As a practical matter, discrete judgments about particular cases will often prove inadequate.89 Sometimes, people do not have clear intuitions about how cases should come out. Sometimes, seemingly similar cases provoke different reactions, and it is necessary to raise the level of theoretical ambition to explain whether those different reactions are justified or to show that the seemingly similar cases are different after all. Sometimes, different people simply disagree. By looking at broader principles, we may be able to mediate the disagreement. In any case, there is a problem of explaining our considered judgments about particular cases - to make sure that they are not just an accident90 - and at some point, the law may well want to offer that explanation. 
Ambitious thinkers might therefore urge that low-level principles may conflict with one another or be demonstrably wrong. In these circumstances, judges might well resort to higher theory. When our modest judge joins an opinion that is incompletely theorized, he must rely on a reason or a principle that justifies one outcome rather than another. Perhaps the principle is wrong because it fails to fit with other cases, or because it is not defensible as a matter of political morality.91 A distinguished judge will seek to add a good deal in the way of both width and depth by exploring other cases and by deepening the theoretical ambition of his analysis. He will therefore experience a kind of conceptual ascent in which the more or less isolated and small 86 Id. 87 See infra pp. 1765-66. 88 See SIDGWICK,supra note 69, at 96-IO4. 89 See id. at IOO. 
90 "[T]he resulting code seems an accidental aggregate of precepts, which stands in need of some rational synthesis." Id. at 102. 
91 See DWORKIN, supra note 15, at 251-54 (discussing local priority). low-level principle is finally made part of a more general theory. Perhaps this would be a paralyzing task, and perhaps our judge need not often attempt it. But it is an appropriate model for understanding law and an appropriate aspiration for evaluating legal practice. 
The conceptual ascent is especially desirable in light of the likelihood that incompletely theorized agreements will contain large pockets of injustice and inconsistency. Unambitious principles and high levels of particularity may ensure that the similarly situated are not treated similarly. Or perhaps some areas of the law will make internal sense, but because the categories with sense are small, they may run into each other if they are compared. We may have a coherent category of law involving sex equality and a coherent category involving racial equality, but these categories may have a strange relation to each other or to the categories involving sexual orientation and the handicapped. Various subcategories of tort law may make sense, but they may not fit together, or they may not cohere with the law of contract. We might conclude that judges should think of incompletely theorized agreements as an early step toward something both wider and deeper. Many academic understandings of law undertake the task of developing that wider and deeper conception.92 
There is some truth in this response. Very probably, moral reasoners should try to achieve vertical and horizontal consistency, not just the local pockets of coherence offered by incompletely theorized agreements. In democratic processes, it is appropriate and sometimes indispensable to challenge existing practice in abstract terms. But the response ignores some of the distinctive characteristics of the arena in which real-world judges must do their work. Some of these limits involve bounded rationality and thus what should happen in a world in which people face various constraints; others involve appropriate judicial (and in some ways political) morality and mutual interaction in a world in which judges are mere actors in a complex system and in which people legitimately disagree on first principles. In light of these limits, incompletely theorized agreements have the many virtues described above, including the facilitation of convergence, the reduction of costs of disagreement,93and the demonstration of humility and mutual respect. As I have noted, incompletely theorized agreements are especially well adapted to a system that must take precedents as fixed points; lawyers could not try to reach full integrity without severely compromising the system of precedent. Usually, local coherence is the most to which lawyers may aspire.94 Just as legislation cannot be un92 See, e.g., DWORKIN,supra note I5, at 276-3I2 (discussing the law of tort); POSNER, supra note I5, passim. 
93 See AMY GUTMANN & DENNIS THOMPSON, DEMOCRACYAND DISAGREEMENT(forthcoming I995). 
94 See RAz, Relevance of Coherence, supra note 49, at 298-303. derstood as if it came from a single mind, so precedents, compiled by many people responding to different problems in many different periods, will not reflect a single authorial voice. 
There are many lurking questions here. What are the criteria for evaluating moral or political judgments? What is the relation between provisional or considered judgments about particulars and corresponding judgments about abstractions?9 Some people write as if abstract theoretical judgments, or abstract theories, have a kind of reality and hardness that particular judgments lack, or as if abstract theories provide the answers to examination questions that particular judgments, tested against the theories, may pass or fail. On this view, theories may be treated as searchlights that illuminate particular judgments and show them for what they really are.96 But we might think instead that there is no special magic in theories or abstractions, and that theories are simply the (humanly constructed) means by which people make sense of their ethical and political worlds. The abstract deserves no priority over the particular: neither is foundational; neither is harder or more real. A (poor or crude) abstract theory may simply be a confused way of trying to make sense of our considered judgments about particular cases, which may be much better than the theory. Of course, particular judgments may be confused too.97 
Dworkin's conception of law as integrity offers a theory of what it means for law to be legitimate. Hercules can produce vertical and horizontal consistency among judgments of principle in law. Do incompletely theorized agreements comport with any plausible conception of legitimacy? We have seen that a legal system pervaded by such agreements need not yield anything like full coherence. Perhaps this is a decisive defect. 
A complete response would require a detailed discussion of one of the largest issues of political morality; for the moment, a few brief remarks must suffice. In fact, the idea of integrity, insofar as it is a judicial product, is unlikely to provide a convincing theory of legitimacy. Indeed, it seems plausible to say that integrity, as Dworkin de95 In Rawls'understandinogf the searchforreflectiveequilibriumw,e consult"ourconsidered convictionsat all levelsof generalityn;o one level,say thatof abstractprincipleor thatof particularjudgmentsin particularcases,is viewedas foundational.They all mayhavean initialcredibility." RAWLSs,upra note 4, at 8 n.8. 
96 See, e.g., BRUCE A. ACKERMAN,PRIVATEPROPERTYAND THE CONSTITUTION I5-20 (I977) (comparing"ScientificPolicymakers"with "OrdinaryObservers")P;OSNER, supra note I5, at 23-24 (arguingthat economictheoryoften underliesopinionsthat appearto be basedon other grounds). 
97 For illuminatingremarkson abstractionss,ee RAWLS, cited above in note 4, at 44-46. Rawlsthinksthatwe turnto abstraction"swhenwe aretornwithinourselves."Id. at 44. This is undoubtedlytrue,but sometimeswe turninsteadto particularswhen we are so torn. scribes it, is neither necessary nor sufficient for legitimacy, judicial or otherwise. Legitimacy stems not simply from principled consistency on the part of adjudicators (or someone else) but from a justifiable exercise of public force. That theory should be founded in a theory of authority98 and hence (if we are democrats) in suitably constrained democratic considerations. In this light, Dworkin's conception of integrity offers an excessively court-centered conception of legitimacy. It sees legitimacy not as an exercise of legitimate authority, or as an outcome of well-functioning democratic procedures, but instead as a process of distinction-making undertaken by judges.99 Even if done exceptionally well, distinction-making by principled judges is an inadequate source of legitimacy. 
Of course, principled consistency should not be disparaged, and a regime of principle, as Dworkin understands it, has many advantages over imaginable alternatives. Problems of legitimacy may arise precisely because of the absence of such consistency. But a theory of adjudicative legitimacy should be part of a theory of just institutions, and an approach focused solely or principally on adjudication will not provide any such theory. By contrast, those who stress incompletely theorized agreements insist that adjudication is part of a complex set of authoritative institutional arrangements, most prominently including democratic arenas. They attempt to design their theory of judicial conduct as an aspect of a far broader set of understandings about appropriate institutional arrangements and about institutions in which the (suitably constrained) public can deliberate about its judgments. 
Above all, they see the American system as one of deliberative democracy in which judges play a partial role.100 For reasons of both policy and principle, the development of large-scale theories of the right and the good is most fundamentally a democratic task, not a judicial one.10' These are brief and inadequate remarks, but they tend to suggest the ingredients of an account of legitimacy of which incompletely theorized agreements would be a part. 
Full integrity, moreover, consists of much more than a legal system of numerous, hierarchically arranged courts can be expected to offer. Judges generally should and will reason from cases with which they 98 See RAz,supranote 23, at 2I-69 (offeringa theoryof authority). 
99 Thereis some anbiguityin Dworkin'streatments,ince integrityis a politicalvirtue,not simplya legalone. I am not sureof the intendedrelationbetweenpoliticalintegrityandintegrity in law.

101 ACKERMAN, cited above in note 58, at 86-99, takes the same basic position but sees the judicial role as the "synthesis"of constitutional moments. I am rejecting the latter claim and saying that, with some exceptions, courts do and should avoid large-scale synthesis. disagree - because of the need for predictability and stability in law, because of the need to avoid judicial hubris, and because similarly situated people should be treated similarly.'02 But across the broad expanse of the law, the resulting judgments are unlikely fully to cohere. 
Incompletely theorized agreements have virtues, but as I have noted, their virtues are partial. Stability, for example, is brought about by such agreements, and stability is usually desirable, but a system that is stable and unjust should probably be made less stable. Agreement is important, but disagreement is important too, for it can be a creative force in revealing error and injustice. In this final section, I offer some qualifications to what has been said thus far. In brief: some cases cannot be decided at all without introducing a fair amount in the way of theoretical ambition. Moreover, some cases cannot be decided well without increasing the level of theoretical ambition. If a good abstraction is available, and if diverse judges can be persuaded that the abstraction is good, there should be no taboo against its judicial acceptance. The claims on behalf of incompletely theorized agreements are presumptive rather than conclusive. 
Thus far, the discussion has offered a static description of the legal process - a description in which judges are deciding what to do at a certain time. Of course, low-level principles are developed over long periods, and a dynamic picture shows something different and more complex. First, the understanding of these low-level principles may shift and perhaps deepen. At one point, libel of a public figure might seem analogous to libel of a private figure and therefore be unprotected; at another point, it might seem more analogous to political speech and therefore be protected. In this process, courts may move to higher levels of abstraction. 
102 A challengeto this viewcan be foundin JosephRaz'silluminatingdiscussionof coherence, but in my view, Raz concludestoo quicklythat"speakingwith one voice"is not an independent ideal,and I thinkthathe rejectstoo quicklythe view thatjudgesshouldreasonfromcaseswith whichtheydisagreeas a matterof morality.See RAz,Relevanceof Coherences,upranote49, at 297-98. Raz emphasizesthe problemscreatedwhenjudgesreasonfromcases that embodybad moraljudgments.The answerto Raz's claimis institutional.Judgesshouldreasonfrompreviouslydecidedcasesnot becauseit is goodto sacrificegoodmoralvalues,but becausethe judge's conceptionof good moralvalues is not alwaysreliable,and becausekeeping(local)faith with precedentis a way of discipliningthe judges,promotingpredictabilitya,nd ensuringa formof equality.Of course,the extentto whicha particularjudgeshouldkeepfaithwith a pastdecision (whichshe believeswrong)cannotbe decidedin the abstract. What I am suggestingis that decisionsthat the judge believeswrongmay not in fact be wrong,and that the obligationto reasonfrompast casesmakesbest senseif it is seen as questioningthe (ordinaryj)udge'sability to makethis judgmentwell. 
Second, a characteristic role of observers of the legal process is to try to systematize cases in order to see how to make best sense of them, to show that there is bias and inconsistency, or to show that no sense can be made of them at all. In any process of systematization, more abstraction will be introduced. Observers may try to invoke some higher-level idea of the good or the right in order to show the deep structure of the case law, or to move it in particular directions, or to reveal important, even fatal inconsistencies. A demonstration that the law makes deep sense might be a source of comfort and occasional reform. A demonstration that the law makes no sense, or reflects an ad hoc compromise among competing principles, might produce discomfort and large-scale change. 
Third, the law sometimes reflects more ambitious thinking on the part of judges or reacts to these more ambitious efforts by outsiders. The law of antitrust, for example, is now based in large part on a principle of economic efficiency.103 This development occurred through the gradual incorporation of economic thinking into the cases, beginning with the judicial suggestion, following academic observation, that some important cases "actually"or "implicitly"were founded on economics, and continuing until economics appeared to offer a large ordering role.'04 Some especially ambitious or creative judges will invoke theories too. Some of our great judges were principally nontheoretical thinkers - Harlan, Friendly, Cardozo - but some of them Holmes, Brandeis, Marshall - had at least ingredients of a large-scale vision of the legal order. They used analogies, to be sure, but often with reference to a relatively high-level theory about some area of law. Many areas of law now show the influence of Holmes, Brandeis, and Marshall, in part because courts, whether or not they deploy low-level principles, have adopted aspects of the relevant theory.105 
It is very rare for any area of law to be highly theorized. Most of the time, people starting from divergent points can accept (or reject) relevant outcomes. But I do not mean to say that it would always be bad for theories to be introduced, nor do I deny that small-scale, lowlevel principles can become part of something more ambitious. A descriptive point first: it is important to note that, after a period of time, the use of low-level principles may well result in a more completely theorized system of law. The process of low-level judging can yield greater abstraction, or a highly refined and coherent set of principles. 103See, e.g., ContinentaTl.V., Inc. v. GTE SylvaniaInc., 433 U.S. 36, 56-59 (I977). 104 See, e.g., James C. Miller III & Paul Pautler, Predation: The Changing View in Economics and the Law, 28 J. LAW & ECON4.95, 495-502 (I985) (discussingthe prominentrole that economicanalysisand scholarlyreseaxchhave playedin shapingantitrustpredationlaw). 
105The bestexamplemaybe the law of freespeech. See Whitneyv. California2,74U.S. 357, 372, 375-78 (I927) (Brandeis, J., concurring);Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 6I6, 624, 63o-3I (I9I9) (Holmes,J., dissenting).Note, however,thatevenhere,no unitarytheoryof freespeechis offered,and nothingvery muchlike a philosophicaalccountappearsin the relevantopinions. In the areas of free speech and discrimination, some such process has occurred, resulting in occasionally ambitious claims, even if it would be far too much to say that full theorization or coherence can be found.106 
An especially interesting phenomenon occurs when a once-contestable analogy becomes part of the uncontested background for ordinary legal work - or when the uncontested background is drawn into sharp question, sometimes via analogies. Thus, for example, the view that bans on racial intermarriage are "like" segregation laws is now taken largely for granted; it is part of the way that lawyers order their conceptual world. So too, perhaps, with the view that sex discrimination is "like"race discrimination - a view that would have been unthinkable in Supreme Court opinions as late as, say, I965. Ordinarily, the slippage from the uncontested to the contested occurs in law through encounters with particular cases that reveal gaps or problems with the conventional view.107 In American law, views that once were taken as natural - or not even as views at all - sometimes become dislodged in this way. The original attack on the monarchical legacy took this form;'08so too did the attack on racial hierarchy; so too did the New Deal, which depended on an insistence that common law categories were far from natural and prepolitical but instead were a conscious social choice.109 Eventually, the contested can become uncontroversial as new categories emerge and harden through repeated encounters with particular cases. 
Now turn to the question of what judges should do. I have urged that there are reasons for judges to offer the least ambitious argument necessary to resolve cases, in the hope that different people from their diverse standpoints can converge on that argument, and with the belief that abstractions may prove troublesome for later cases. But if judges can agree on an abstraction, and if the abstraction can be shown to be a good one, judicial acceptance of that abstraction may hardly be troubling but, on the contrary, an occasion for celebra106 See, e.g., City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 439-47 (I985) (failing to offer a full theoryof equality);New YorkTimesCo. v.

109 See SUNSTEIN, supra note 64, at 40-67. tion.110 Who could object to judicial adoption of what is by hypothesis a good theory? If agreement is possible on a good abstraction, a legal system will have done its job especially well; consider, as possibilities, antitrust or equal protection law. But any abstractions will likely have been developed through the generalization and clarification of incompletely theorized outcomes, accomplished by constant reference to concrete cases against which the theory is measured. At least part of the test of the theory - if it is a theory of law meant for judicial adoption - is how well it accounts for the cases and for considered judgments about the cases, though of course judicial mistakes are possible, and these may be corrected by the theory, subject to the constraints of stare decisis. 
I am thus declining to endorse what might be called a strong version of the argument offered here: a claim that incompletely theorized agreements are always the appropriate approach to law and that more ambitious theory is always illegitimate in law. What I am urging is a more modest point, keyed to the institutional characteristics of judges in any legal system we are likely to have. Judges should adopt a presumption rather than a taboo against high-level theorization. Usually, they should invoke the lowest levels of theoretical ambition necessary to decide the case. In many contexts, they will not be able to think of a good theory. In many cases, they will not be able to agree on any theory. The effort to reach agreement on relative abstractions may make it hard for judges or other people to live and work together, and unnecessary contests over theory can suggest an absence of respect for the deepest and most defining commitments of other people."' 
It may even happen that an area of judge-made law will become less theorized over time. A once-acceptable general theory may come to seem inadequate, and confrontations with particular cases may show its inadequacy and make it unravel. The Supreme Court's decisions in the Lochner era were relatively well-theorized, in the sense that they were founded on a recognizable general theory of the permissible role of the state.112 The general theory was not replaced with a new one all of a sudden, or even at all; instead, it came apart through particular cases that attacked the periphery and then the core."13 This is a familiar phenomenon, as the process of case-by-case decision tests 110 Considerf,or example,AlexanderMeiklejohn'suggestionthatNew York7TmesCo. v. Sullivan was "anoccasionfor dancingin the streets,"as reportedin HarryKalven,Jr., The New York Times Case: A Note on "TheCentralMeaning of the First Amendment,"I964 SuP. CT. REV. I9I, 22I n.125. 
111There are intrapersonal parallels. In our ethical lives as individuals, each of us may avoid choice among theories if we do not need to choose in order to decide what to do in particular cases. But the interpersonal case is perhaps more vivid. 
112 See STONE,SEIDMANS,UNSTEIN& TUSHNETs,upra note 58, at 787-807. 
113 See West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379, 391-93 (I937); Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502, 535-39 (I934). any general theory and exposes its limits. Over time, an area of law may become more theorized or less so; over long periods of time, it may go from one to the other, and back again. 
If all this is right, we ought not to think of incompletely theorized agreements on particulars as a kind of unfortunate second-best, adopted for a world in which people disagree, are confused or biased, and have limited time. The alleged first-best - Hercules, or the (exhausted?) judge who has reached reflective equilibrium - calls for an extra-human conception of law. It is extra-human because it is so obviously unsuited to the real world. To say the least, it is hard to know whether a top-down or highly theorized approach is appropriate for morality. But often, at least, it is easy to know that such an approach is inappropriate for law. The institutional features of the legal system. - a human institution with distinctive constraints - require an account of law that is highly sensitive to the characteristics of the system in which it is situated. Among those characteristics are confusion or uncertainty about general theory, deep disputes about the right and the good, and a pressing need to make a wide range of particular decisions. 
What of disagreement? The discussion thus far has focused mostly on the need to obtain agreement or convergence. This is only part of the picture. In law, as in politics, disagreement can be a productive and creative force - revealing error, showing gaps, moving discussion in appropriate directions. The American political order has placed a high premium on "government by discussion,"114and when the process is working well, this is true for the judiciary as well as for other institutions. Progress in politics and even law is often fueled by failures of convergence and by sharp disagreement on both the particular and the general. 
It should be unnecessary to emphasize that legal disagreements may have many legitimate sources. Two of these sources are especially important. First, people may share general commitments but disagree on particular outcomes. This is no less pervasive a social phenomenon than its converse, which I have stressed here. People may think, for example, that it is wrong to take innocent life, but disagree about whether the Constitution protects the right to have an abortion. They may think that everyone has a right to be free from invidious discrimination, but disagree about the legitimacy of affirmative action. It is common to find agreement on the general alongside disagreement on the particular. 
114 SAMUELH. BEER, To MAKE A NATION: THE REDISCOVERYOF AMERICANFEDERALISM74 ('993). 
Second, people's disagreements on general principles may produce disagreements over low-level propositions as well. People who think that an autonomy principle accounts for freedom of speech may also think that the government cannot regulate truthful, nondeceptive commercial advertising - whereas people who think that freedom of speech is a democratic idea may have no interest in commercial advertising at all. People who think that tort law is founded on Kantian understandings may think that strict liability is required, whereas utilitarians may disagree. Academic theorizing about law can have a salutary function in part because it tests low-level principles by reference to more ambitious claims. Disagreements can be productive by virtue of this process of testing. 
It is important, then, to emphasize that disagreements are sometimes desirable and that incompletely theorized agreements may be nothing to celebrate. If everyone having a reasonable general view converges on a particular (by hypothesis reasonable) judgment, nothing is amiss. This is the basic phenomenon to which I am calling attention here. But if an agreement is incompletely theorized, there is a risk that everyone who participates in the agreement is mistaken, and hence that the outcome is mistaken too. There is also a risk that someone who is reasonable has not participated and that if that person were included, the agreement would break down. Incompletely theorized agreements should therefore be subject to scrutiny over time. Nor is social consensus, or something approaching consensus, a consideration that outweighs everything else. Usually, it would be much better to have a just outcome, rejected by many people, than an unjust outcome with which most or even almost all agree. Consensus or agreement is important largely because of its connection with stability, itself a valuable but far from overriding social goal. 
Of course, it would be foolish to say that no general theory can produce agreement, even more foolish to deny that some general theories deserve general support, and most foolish of all to say that incompletely theorized agreements warrant respect whatever their content. What seems plausible is something more modest: except in unusual situations, and for multiple reasons, general theories are an unlikely foundation for judge-made law, and caution and humility about general theory are appropriate for judges, at least when multiple theories can lead in the same direction. This more modest set of claims helps us to see that incompletely theorized agreements are important phenomena with their own special virtues. Such agreements are the lawyer's distinctive solution to the problem of social pluralism. 
Henry Hart and Albert Sacks of course defended the view, influential for the last generation, that courts engage in principled reasoning and elaboration of basic social commitments, while the political process involves an ad hoc set of judgments often producing unprincipled compromises.115 This view finds its most extreme statement in Dworkin's Hercules metaphor, which sees constitutional courts as "the forum of principle."116 But as description, this view is historically myopic. Courts do offer reasons and principles, but those principles tend to be modest and low-level. By contrast, high principle has had its most important and most defining moments inside the political branches of government, not within courtrooms. The founding, the Civil War, the New Deal, and other periods of social reform17 - progressivism, the civil rights movement, the women's movement - suggest that the key forum of principle in American government has been democratic rather than adjudicative. 
The question might therefore be asked whether it would be possible to reverse the Hart and Sacks formulation, and to propose instead that high principle plays an appropriately large role in the democratic arena while low-level principles are the more appropriate and usual stuff of adjudication. Any such view would be too simple, but there is a good deal of truth to it. Of course, high principle does not characterize ordinary politics, but high principle has had an important defining role in American political life, and in any case, the principles that mark American constitutionalism owe their origins to political rather than legal developments. There are important exceptions, when courts make or refer to arguments of high principle,118but ordinarily those exceptions consist of vindications of (certain readings of) constitutional judgments made by previous generations. As I have suggested, the argument on behalf of incompletely theorized agreements is therefore part of a theory of authority and of just institutions, rooted in a claim that fundamental principles are best developed politically rather than judicially. 
115 See HENRY M. HART, JR. & ALBERT M. SACKS, THE LEGAL PROCESS:BASICPROBLEMS IN THE MAKING AND APPLICATIONOF LAW643-46(WilliamN. EskridgeJ,r. & PhilipP. Frickey eds., 1994). 
116 RONALD DWORKIN,The Forum of Principle, in A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE33, 69-7I (I985); see also supra note 8I. Note in this regard that Dworkin's discussion of "passivism"in constitutional law, see DWORKIN, supra note I5, at 369-79, does not deal with the need for devices to limit the power of judicial review in light of the judges' likely biases and institutional weaknesses, and it fails to see the possibility that, because of those weaknesses, there is a gap between the actual meaning of the Constitution and judicial pronouncements about that meaning. See id. at 370; cf Lawrence G. Sager, Fair Measure: The Legal Status of Underenforced Constitutional Norms, 9I HARV. L. REv. 12I2, 1213-28 (1978) (discussing that gap). The presumption in favor of theoretical modesty is one way of disciplining judicial power in light of judicial weaknesses. 117 See ACKERMAN,supra note 58, at 40-56. 
118 Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 495 (1954), is, of course, the most important example. 
CONCLUSION: THE LIMITS OF THEORY 
A key task for a legal system is to enable people who disagree on first principles to converge on outcomes in particular cases. Incompletely theorized agreements help to produce judgments on relative particulars amidst conflict on relative abstractions. 
Notwithstanding these points, the impulse to theorize should not be disparaged. In some areas of law, we cannot think very well without embarking on a kind of conceptual ascent from the incompletely theorized outcome, and the conceptual ascent will require us to say broader and deeper things. It is sometimes desirable to think about an issue very deeply; this is certainly true for academic observers, and also for people in politics, in which abstractions and aspirations play a crucial role. But judges must decide many cases quickly; they have limited time and capacities. They must also work with each other, and contests over the right and the good can make it hard for them to do so. Like ordinary people, judges should obey a norm of mutual respect, or of reciprocity, and this norm can incline judges to avoid large-scale contests, at least when they involve people's deepest or most defining commitments. 
These considerations might be made part of a role-specific account of public reason - an account of public reason designed specifically for participants in adjudication. But it would not be surprising if at least some of these points turned out to connect with some of the broader aspirations of a well-functioning deliberative democracy. Like judges, ordinary people have limited time and capacities; they too must live with one another. At least as much as judges, they should discuss their disputes in ways that entail mutual respect, and thus avoid unnecessary controversies over fundamental commitments. 
I have emphasized that general theory - involving broad claims about the right and the good - plays an appropriate role in the political sphere. In law, I have argued that there is, and should be, a presumptive taboo against making broad and general claims; there is, and should be, no such taboo in the world of public reason. But citizens and representatives, like judges, must make decisions about concrete controversies in the face of sharp or even intractable disagreements on first principles. Entirely outside of law, and in the world of ordinary democratic discussion, incompletely theorized agreements play an important role. 
There is, however, an important exception to the general claim that I have made throughout this essay. In order for participants in law (or democracy) to accept that general claim, they must accept at least one general theory: the theory that I have attempted to defend. This is the theory that tells them to favor incompletely theorized agreements. That theory probably cannot itself be accepted without reference to general theoretical considerations, and its acceptance or rejection should not be incompletely theorized. Many people claim that law should reflect a high-level theory of the right or the good, and they will not be satisfied with incompletely theorized agreements.119 The choice between the two approaches will turn on issues that are both high-level and quite controversial. 
This is an important matter. But it is notable that the belief in incompletely theorized agreements, while tacit, is quite widespread. The best evidence is the legal culture itself Such agreements are the usual stuff of law, and participants in the legal culture are suspicious of much in the way of theoretical ambition. There are reasons for their suspicion. What I have tried to do here is to spell out those reasons and to connect them to some of the most notable characteristics of thinking in law. 
119 Recall, however, that the grounds for such agreements are diverse, and that it is possible to accept some while rejecting others. See supra pp. 1745-51. In this sense, an incompletely theorized judgment in support of incompletely theorized agreements is certainly imaginable. 
Rights After Communism Ins5iutonal and psychological perspectives on postcommunist rights Introduction Cass R. Sunstein Contrary to the suggestion in much Western political thought, rights do not fall from the sky. They depend for their existence on public institutions. 
They cost money, perhaps a great deal of money. (This is true not only for social and economic rights but for so-called negative rights as well; government cannot protect property and life itself without resources.) Rights will not exist without a rights-bearing culture, that is, a culture in which ordinary people are at least sometimes willing to take serious personal risks by challenging powerful people by insisting that rights are at stake. The protection of rights will require government to act in both public and private spheres, sometimes within the family itself (as, for example, in the prevention of domestic violence). 
These are the principal lessons that emerge from the following essays on rights after Communism. 
Ewa Letowska shows that the activity of the ombudsman-a potentially crucial actor in Eastern Europe-has been necessary to ensure that rights on paper actually mean something in the real world. 
Ombudsman action was required in Poland to establish that a woman could not be refused employment because the job of engine driver was "too hard for her"; ombudsman action was also necessary to upset a conviction of a professor who had criticized a particular decision of the minister of education as reminiscent of "socialist pathology." (The prosecution itself certainly deserved that appellation even if the decision at issue did not.) Kim Lane Scheppele shows that paper guarantees of sex equality can coexist with extensive sex discrimination and inequality. Consider the fact that in Poland, 90 occupations are closed to women by law, and that no laws in Eastern Europe ban sexual harassment. Russia has created extensive constitutional protections for the accused and committed those protections to paper; but the Supreme Court of Russia has held that the privilege against self-incrimination is sufficiently protected if the defendant is told that he has a right to give a statement of confession (on the astonishing theory that this statement implicitly conveys the right not to give such a statement). 
Inga Mikhailovskaia's important empirical study shows, among many other things, that the right to religious liberty and the right to receive and distribute information are ranked as "important" or "very important" by less than half of respondents, whereas the right to social security is so ranked by nearly 96 percent. This finding has many possible implications. Certainly it is reasonable to say that the finding suggests what will happen in the future: The rights people actually have will likely have some connection with the rights that they want. But we might react as well by insisting that the responses are disturbing, since the category of rights, and especially of constitutional rights, need not be coextensive with the category of important human interests. Rights are, among other things, pragmatic instruments whose acknowledgment in law is designed to accomplish concrete socialtasks. To say that there ought not to be a legal right to (for example) environmental quality is not to disparage environmental protection; so too with the right to fair compensation for one's labor; so too with the right to equal pay for equal work. 
The acknowledgment of these things as rights may not accomplish anything in the world; rights of this sort may not realistically be subject to protection through courts or through other public channels. We do not disparage such interests if we refuse to recognize them as rights, or if we reserve the category of legal rights to human interests whose protection as rights will actually do some good for human beings. 
There is a final point. One of Mikhailovskaia's questions opposes individual rights to the interests of the state, and asks whether the former can be 
EAST EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW abridged because of the latter. But many rights actually serve collective interests, by making it possible to have and maintain a certain kind of society with a certain sort of culture. Consider here the legal philosopher Joseph Raz's striking suggestion: "If I were to choose between living in a society which enjoys freedom of expression, but not having the right myself, or enjoying the right in a society which does not have it, I would have no hesitation in judging that my own personal interest is better served by the first option." Rights and Individual Well-Being, in Ethics in the Public Domain 39 (1994). Part of the reason for a system of free speech is not to protect the individual speaker, but to allow processes of public deliberation and discussion that serve public goals by, for example, constraining governmental power and makingjust and effective outcomes more likely. 
This point--often ignored in the West as well as the East-suggests that many rights deserve to exist because of their consequences for society in general. 
A point of this kind permeates the essays that follow. It helps account for the need for real-world institutions safeguarding constitutional guarantees, and for the more than occasional difficulty of obtaining such institutions in view of the complex psychology of rights.

Law is a normative enterprise; it is inevitably philosophical. For this reason, the distinction between legal theory and legal practice is at most one of degree. Certainly it can be shown that much legal practice takes theoretical issues for granted, but this does not mean that it is not pervaded by theoretical claims. On the other hand, there are real hazards for lawyers who use political philosophy to inform legal practice, especially when the philosophy is designed for a first-best world, or when it rests on assumptions that do not hold for us. Moreover, legal practice might seek to bracket philosophical questions, in order to facili tate change over time, to allow an incompletely theorized agreement on particular outcomes among people who disagree on first principles, and to avoid various forms of hubris. 
These will be my basic claims in this essay. In part 1, I briefly support the view that even mundane claims about the content of law have large-scale theoretical components. In part 2, I discuss some of the problems that arise when lawyers rely on what philosophers think. In part 3, I explain why a system of legal practice might limit its philosophical ambitions, in the process contrasting an antitheoretical, highly practical judge— Justice John Marshall Harlan—with Ronald Dworkin's Her cules. An important point here is that people who diverge sharply on large principles might well be able to agree on spe cific cases. This point helps explain why in a heterogeneous society, a normative practice, including law, might seek to bracket philosophical questions, and do so successfully. 
I. How Law Is Philosophical All descriptive claims about the content of law depend in some important way on ideas about the right, the good, or both. When we read Supreme Court opinions or appellate briefs, or if we listen to how lawyers discuss their cases, we find many claims about liberty, rights, equality, and justice. For example, the Constitution says that no state shall deprive any person of the equal protection of the laws. What does this mean? How do we even go about knowing what it means? Suppose that a state discriminates against homosexuals, fails to provide welfare ben efits, creates an affirmative action program, or stops people under eighteen from voting. Has there been a constitutional vi olation? 
Begin with the text. Very rapidly it becomes clear that the word "equal" has multiple meanings. The term could be a pro hibition on irrational differentiation; it could guarantee mini mally decent conditions for all; it could forbid caste systems; it could require a legitimate public purpose for all laws; it could forbid large disparities in wealth. Because of the multiplicity of textually plausible readings, we will be forced to resort to something supplemental to text in order to bring it to bear on disputed cases. Unless we can get help elsewhere, it will be necessary to make some substantive judgment about the appro priate conception of equal protection under the Constitution. 
We might then try another route. We might ask some ques tions about the understanding of the people who wrote the provision. Suppose that they intended to prohibit all discrimina tion against blacks but to do nothing else. (Let us put to one side the many complexities in the notion of an "intention" or an "understanding" of a collective decision-making body.) Then it becomes necessary to ask whether this intention is binding. How will we resolve this question? Without circularity we cannot say that the intention is binding because the framers intended it to be binding. Before long, we will have to say something about democracy, majoritarianism, rights, and much else. Here too, large-scale theoretical claims seem unavoidable. 
We might turn then to the judicial precedents, at least if we have some. The first question is: On what principle of equality are those precedents based? But this question will not be easy to answer. Suppose, for example, that the Court has forbidden school segregation. How does this precedent bear on affirmative action or substandard welfare benefits? To decide, we will have to choose how to characterize the precedents, and to do that, we will have to say something substantive about the appropriate equality principle. Precedents are not brute facts. And if the precedents are genuinely helpful, we have to ask whether they should be binding. And to answer that question, we will have to discuss the need for stability in law, the possibility of mistake, the potential for democratic correction, and so forth. 
I think that this example shows the extent to which people engaging in the practice of law must make theoretical claims. The line between legal practice and legal theory is blurry. The point is not limited to the sometimes exotic area of constitu tional law. Suppose, for example, that someone claims that he need not comply with his contractual obligation to sell one thou sand barrels of widgets for one hundred dollars, because the price of widgets has risen so unexpectedly in the past week as a result of a strike in the widget factory. A legal system must answer this question by reference to something—and that something must be a conception of autonomy, or utility, or efficiency, or welfare, or something else. Even mundane areas of the law of contracts are thus pervaded by theoretical claims about the reasons for social obligations. The familiar notion of "party autonomy" hardly makes such claims unnecessary; it is merely a resort to a certain kind of theoretical claim. 
Much the same is true of tort law, which has to decide on appropriate spheres of human action. Judgments about causa tion are of course rooted in theories of moral responsibility. Nor can judges say whether there is an act or an omission—a relevant distinction in many areas of the law—without positing a morally privileged state of affairs. To do that, we will have to discuss theoretical questions. Similar things can be said about criminal law, which is pervaded by issues of intention, fault, and responsibility; these issues cannot be approached without theoretical claims. 
It is sometimes thought that those engaged in law may often bracket such claims and that they must speculate on abstract matters only on issues at the frontiers of the law, when existing legal materials are not decisive. Such "frontiers" cases, it is said, are rare. But even the easiest cases present theoretical issues. Jones is said to have violated the law fixing a speed limit of fifty miles per hour. Perhaps Jones was trying to get to the hospital; perhaps he was late for work; perhaps his mind wandered. In any of these cases, should the judge convict Jones? If the answer is yes, it is for reasons that have to do with, among other things, the appropriate role of judges in a democracy, and this is a substantive view that should be defended even if now uncontro versial. Easy cases can claim to be easy only on the basis of reasons. 
These ideas do not need to be belabored. Much of the change in legal education in the last decades has stemmed from work by economists, philosophers, and others who have shown that many of the conventional legal categories—even conventional conceptions of how to describe "the facts"—turn out to depend on philosophical claims, and often on controversial ones. In this sense, legal practice has inescapable theoretical dimensions. 
It may well be unfortunate if those who practice law are not self-conscious about this fact. Sometimes the claims that under lie law are taken as self-evident—as in the view that an abortion is an act rather than an omission, or that the meaning of a text is determined by investigating the views of its drafters, or that emotion and reason are at opposite poles, or that democracy and majoritarianism are the same thing, or that there is sharp distinction between "words" and "conduct." Such claims depend on complex theoretical judgments that ought to be brought into the open and evaluated as such. 
II. How Lawyers Misuse Philosophy 
and Philosophers None of this necessarily means that lawyers should turn to philosophy or to great philosophers for the answers to their questions. There are several characteristic risks with efforts of this sort. First, lawyers may misunderstand philosophers (as they sometimes misunderstand economists). Here as elsewhere, a little knowledge may be a dangerous thing. Second, and more interestingly, lawyers may fail to understand the difficulties in bringing philosophical arguments to bear on concrete legal dis putes. The application may seem mechanical, but it usually requires an act of translation, and one that involves a large element of construction. Suppose that we seek to be good Lock eans, and that we want to know how to deal with the question whether government should forbid private race discrimination. When a private employer refuses to hire blacks, the employer has not committed any act of conventional force or fraud. Does this mean that Locke is opposed to the Civil Rights Act of 1964? It should be obvious that there is no purely factual answer to this question. Instead, lawyers will be forced not to try to un cover some fact, but to offer the best constructive interpretation of Locke, recognizing that the relevant interpretation is neither pure discovery nor pure invention. The Lockean who approves or disapproves of Civil Rights Acts is hardly the historical Locke. Even when a philosopher makes explicit claims about a topic, the application can be far from clear. The Lockean pro viso about the need to leave "enough and as good for others" cannot realistically be said to decide questions about welfare en titlements. 
There is a third problem, having to do with the need for legal solutions to operate in a world with distinctive limitations. Let us suppose, for example, that philosophers have persua sively shown that wealth maximization is a philosophically inde fensible ideal, and that a just state should be concerned instead with utility, with human flourishing, or with protection of a category of basic rights. It might be clear, for example, that the maximization of wealth is too crudely connected to anything that human beings do or should really care about. Have we therefore shown that lawyers should reject the pursuit of wealth maximization through the law of contract and tort? Not neces sarily. It may be that wealth maximization is the approach to contract and tort law that best combines the virtues of substan tive plausibility and real-world administrability. Even if wealth maximization is not in the end a good approach to justice, it might be shown that greater social wealth is at least roughly connected with the achievement of important human values. And if those other values cannot easily be promoted by common law courts—consider utility—perhaps wealth maximization is not so bad after all.1 In any case the philosophical defects with wealth maximization, even if they run deep, may not be decisive for law. 
The example is not exotic. Some philosophers think that a free speech principle that places a special premium on political discussion is extremely attractive.2 But perhaps this approach would be too readily subject to abuse in the real world. Perhaps any institutional judgments about the category of what counts as "the political" would be too biased and unreliable to be ac ceptable. For good institutional reasons, we might adopt a free speech principle of a philosophically inadequate sort, simply because that inadequate approach is the only one that we can safely administer. 
To take another example: Some philosophers believe that emotions have important cognitive dimensions, or that they are a form of cognition, and indeed it seems clear that various emotions—grief, hate, love—are based on judgments of value.3 But a democratic society might still decide that emotions are so likely to be partisan or parochial, or to go wrong in some pre dictable way, that they should be excluded from certain areas of law. The exclusion might be based not on a philosophical mis take about the distinction between reason and emotion, but instead on an awareness of institutional limits faced by human beings in certain situations. 
One hnal example: Suppose that we wanted to ensure that confessions are made under circumstances in which they are truly voluntary. Suppose that we can generate a philosophically adequate account of voluntariness, and that with respect to that account, some confessions that come after the Miranda warnings are involuntary, while some confessions that are given without those warnings turn out to be voluntary. The Miranda rules, in short, turn out to be both overprotective and underprotective with reference to the best philosophical understanding of vol untariness. Do we have a sufficient reason to abandon Miranda? Surely not. The Miranda approach may be the best means of combining real-world administrability with substantive plausibil ity. If so, it may be more than good enough despite its philo sophical inadequacy. The phenomenon of philosophically inad equate but nonetheless justified legal strategies seems to be a pervasive part of a well-functioning system of law. 
This leads to a final point, having to do with the complex connection between theories of the good or the right on the one hand and concrete legal disputes on the other. Perhaps the point emerges most simply by thinking about works of literature that seem to have political components. Dickens and James are obvious examples. It would be obtuse to ask whether Dickens favors worker ownership of plants, or whether James believes that any real revolution must occur quickly or instead in short steps. The problem is not that the works of Dickens and James do not bear on these issues. It is that Dickens and James may greatly deepen understanding of capitalism or of the revolu tionary sensibility without at the same time telling us about what sorts of legal reforms and approaches make sense. 
Some of these same things may also be true of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, or Rawls and Raz. The relationship between any philosophical account of (say) justice and liberty need not lead to any particular specification of outcomes in disputed cases in law. We may believe, with Raz, that human values are not commensurable4 without having endorsed a position about prostitution and surrogacy, about the appropriate remedy for natural resource damages, or about the relationship between specific performance and monetary damages in tort cases. Of course, views about commensurability may influence these de bates. But the philosophical claims cannot be decisive, because there is much else of which real-world institutions must take account. We may think, with Rawls, that the difference principle is required by good thinking about justice, without believing that the Constitution mandates that principle, or even that the United States Congress should pursue that principle in light of the multiple constraints that it faces. In this way philosophical commitments may inform understandings about law without leading to particular judgments about legal disputes. III. Philosophy vs. Law? Of Harlan 
and Hercules Legal positivists sometimes think that law has nothing to do with philosophy, at least in the quiet narrow sense that the legal enterprise can often operate without offering any philosophical or theoretical claims at all.5 In this way, positivists believe that legal practice and legal theory can be sharply distinguished. As against the positivists, Ronald Dworkin famously argues that there is an inevitable evaluative or normative dimension to state ments about what the law is.6 Often, at least, one cannot say "what the law is" without also saying something about "what the law should be." That is, when lawyers disagree about what the law is with respect to some question—can the government ban hate speech? cross-burning?—they are disagreeing about "the best constructive interpretation of the community's legal prac tice."7 Thus Dworkin argues that interpretation in law consists of different efforts to make a governing text "the best it can be." This is Dworkin's conception of law as integrity. 
Hercules, Dworkin's inhnitely patient and resourceful judge, approaches the law in this way. Here we have an interesting view of the relationship between legal theory and legal practice. Is Hercules a theorist or a practioner? The answer is that he is neither and both. Hercules is a practitioner insofar as he takes legal practice—in the form of the existing legal materials—very seriously indeed. People's legal rights may well be different from the rights that would be yielded by the best abstract the ory. Dworkin thus places a large emphasis on "ht" with existing materials as a criterion for correctness of legal outcomes. The lawyerly virtue of integrity is connected with achievement of principled consistency among similar and dissimilar cases; prin cipled consistency may generate outcomes that diverge from what justice requires if it is understood as an independent ideal. Thus justice and integrity are not the same thing. On the other hand, Hercules is a theorist too. To know what the law is, the judge has to cast the existing materials in their best light, and to do this, the judge must often (and perhaps always) take a stand on some large theoretical questions. 
We might compare Hercules' conception of the judicial role 
with the search for reflective equilibrium in politics and ethics.8 Much of practical reasoning, in law and elsewhere, entails an effort to produce general theories by close engagement with considered judgments about particular cases. Those judgments may serve as provisional "fixed points" for inquiry, in the sense that we have a high degree of confidence in them and cannot readily imagine that they could be shaken. In searching for reflective equilibrium, what we think tentatively to be the gen eral theory is adjusted to conform to what we think to be our considered views about particular cases. The particular views are adjusted to conform to the general theory and vice versa. 
There is a close relationship between the search for reflective equilibrium and Hercules' approach to law. Hercules also at tempts to go back and forth between particular judgments— reflected in judicial holdings—and the various theories that account for them. The general theory is adjusted to conform to the holdings. This search for an equilibrium between "fit" and "justification" might be understood to be the practical lawyer's analogue to this conception of the philosopher's project. 
Here we have a distinctive picture of the relationship be tween practice and theory in law. The picture helps show how the lawyer's task is both similar to and importantly different from that of the philosopher. It is also true that a statement describing the law is not a statement about some "plain fact"; when it comes to interpretation, there is often a large evaluative dimension to positions about what the law is.9 Often the dis agreement really rests on what approach makes for the best system of law—which is not the same as saying that it rests on an independent judgment about the best theory. 
Many lawyers, however, wonder whether Dworkin fully de scribes how lawyers think, and their puzzlement says something important about the relationship between theory and practice in law. A serious problem has to do with the practice of analogical reasoning, which lies at the heart of how lawyers (and many ordinary people) proceed. In Dworkin's hands, theories are produced in the large, on the basis of fairly abstract moral theory (so long as the judge respects the duty to fit the cases). These theories are then brought to bear on particular problems. Consider, for example, Dworkin's description of how judges should think about free speech law.10 Dworkin begins with a noninstrumental, "constitutive" conception of free speech, in accordance with which speech is protected because of the need to respect the moral autonomy of the citizenry. On Dworkin's view, moral autonomy is insulted whenever government at tempts to prevent people from hearing things that they hnd persuasive.11 Dworkin brings this idea to bear on the area of libel; he concludes that the Constitution imposes hrm barriers against liability for public or private libel. Or consider the area of race discrimination. On Dworkin's account, the judge must ask: Does the legal prohibition on race discrimination reflect a category of suspect classifications stemming from a general right to be treated as equals; or a right against the use of certain banned categories; or a right not to be subject to prejudice? Dworkin concludes that the third theory is best and that affir mative action is therefore constitutional.12 
Dworkin emphasizes that in answering such questions, law yers will not be pure philosophers. They do not simply develop the best theory from the standpoint of principle; they must offer their answers in a way that is attuned to the need for "fit" and to the courts' proper role. But this concession may be insufficient. In deciding whether, for example, a restriction on private libel offends the first amendment, lawyers usually do not ask which interpretation makes the amendment the best it can be. They do not begin or end with a high-level conception of the values promoted by the amendment. These are broad and abstract questions. They are too hard, large, and open ended for legal actors to handle. They call for responses that are, in one sense, too deeply theorized. 
We might think here about Justice John Marshall Harlan, a very different judge from Hercules. I cannot discuss Harlan's opinions in detail here, but let me offer a few observations. Harlan was an extraordinarily skilled but in many ways a highly conventional common lawyer.13 Harlan's approach to law was at most intermittently theoretical. He avoided large claims. He was a great analogizer. He was closely attuned to connections among cases without attempting high-level theories about the right or the good. And here, I think, we can find a conception of legal practice that at least attempts to be divorced from legal theory. 
That is, Harlan's writings show the possibility of a form of what we might call low-level normative practice, diverging from full scale normative theory. 
Harlan was an especially distinguished judge, but his ap proach to law is far from unfamiliar. In thinking about free speech issues, lawyers engaged in ordinary practice do not gen erate large-scale theories about the meaning of (for example) free expression in a democracy. Instead, they ask what particu lar sorts of practices clearly seem to violate the first amendment, or the principle of free expression, as these are understood through our practice. Then they ask whether a restriction on (for example) private libel is relevantly similar or relevantly different. The same is true of much judicial work in private law; it is also true of statutory construction, at least in difficult cases, where the issue is whether the case at hand resembles the cases at which the statute is unambiguously aimed. Of course, the description of relevant similarities and differences will have evaluative dimensions, and these should be made explicit. But lawyers and judges will not engage in anything like general moral theorizing. If a distinction between legal practice and legal theory is to be sustained, I think that this is the place to start. Everyday legal thinking proceeds without taking high level stands on questions of the right or the good. 
Is this project possible or worthwhile? From the standpoint of Dworkin's Hercules, we might respond in the following way. A judge who operates in this apparently conventional way might end up being Herculean, too. At least he had better have that aspiration in mind. When our modest judge—Harlan rather than Hercules—uses analogical reasoning to say that case A is like case B, he has to rely on a principle. If he is reasoning well, he will have before him a range of other cases, C through Z, in which the principle is tested against others and refined. At least if he is a distinguished judge, he will experience a kind of "conceptual ascent," in which the more or less isolated and low level principle is finally made part of a general theory, or of reflective equilibrium. On this view, Harlan should be seen as someone who engages in a truncated form of what Hercules seeks to do, with the truncation starting at just the point when things start to become interesting or difficult. Little can be said for something as modest and cautious as that. It might there fore be concluded that legal practice is simply a form of legal theory without the requisite self-consciousness or ambition. 
There is some truth in this response. Any claim that one case is like another does depend on the implicit or explicit invocation of a principle. We cannot tell whether a ban on private libel is like a ban on commercial speech, or like a ban on attempted bribery, without a principle enabling us to know what is similar to what. The principle should of course be identified. Once we know what it is, we might want to test the principle by seeing how it coheres with all of the existing legal materials (or with a theory independent of those materials). Thus far, then, Harlan does not seem to be a worthy competitor to Hercules, but merely a somewhat lazy imitator. 
But this view is incomplete. We can identify a number of distinct advantages to what I am describing as a form of practice that is in important respects independent of theory. Each of these advantages is especially important for people engaged in legal reasoning. 
First, this form of reasoning may be the best approach that is available for people of limited time and capacities. The search for reflective equilibrium, or for vertical and horizontal coher ence, may be simply too difficult for participants in law (or for others engaging in practical reasoning in an attempt to think through difficult problems). Often there are too many real world constraints to work out a fully general theory. And when compared with the search for reflective equilibrium, analogical reasoning has the advantage, for ordinary lawyers and judges, of humility and modesty. To engage in analogical reasoning, one need not take a stand on large, contested issues of social life, some of which can be resolved only on a sectarian basis. For this reason, we might think that practical reasoning in law of the sort I am now describing can claim to avoid the risk of hubris. 
Second, reasoning by analogy may have the large advantage of allowing a convergence on particular outcomes by people unable to reach anything like an accord on general principles. Sometimes it is exceedingly difficult to get people to agree on the general principles that account for their judgments. But On Legal Theory and Legal Practice 279 sometimes it is possible to get them to agree on particular solu tions or on low-level principles.14 An incompletely theorized agreement15 is often possible on the view that case A is rele vantly similar to case B—even if those who join the agreement could not decide as between utilitarianism or Kantianism, or come to closure on the appropriate role of religion in society. This is especially important in a legal system, for people must be able to converge on particular judgments even if they dis agree on matters of high principle. It might even be said that allowing this form of convergence is one of the most crucial tasks for a system of adjudication in a liberal democracy. 
There are many examples inside and outside the law. Con sider the enormous difficulties that would arise if any heteroge neous faculty attempted to set out the appropriate general prin ciples by which to decide issues of faculty diversity. It is certainly possible that no such principles could command consensus, or indeed, that the effort to reach consensus would produce acri monious and only mildly productive debate. But even such a faculty might well be able to agree on a wide range of particular appointments cases, with its agreement on outcomes supported by diverse (and incompletely debated) justifications. This exam ple may serve as a metaphor for how legal arguments—and perhaps day-to-day normative practice—really work. People who could not reach agreement on high-level principles, or theorize about their judgments without collapsing into sectari anism, might nonetheless be able to engage in productive, low level debates, and precisely because particular judgments can be supported by a range of diverse principles on which no stand need be taken. This is what happens with most disputes in both public and private law. 
Third, analogical reasoning may be especially desirable in contexts in which we seek moral evolution over time. If the legal culture really did attain reflective equilibrium, it might become too rigid and calcified; we would know what we thought about everything, whether particular or general. By contrast, Harlan's method has the important advantage of allowing a large degree of openness to new facts and perspectives. It enables disagree ment and uncertainty to turn into consensus. This is a large advantage of a form of day-to-day normative practice that is distinct from abstract and general normative theory. 
Fourth, analogical reasoning in law operates with precedents that have the status of fixed points. This is so even for people who disagree with those precedents as a matter of principle. In searching for reflective equilibrium, by contrast, everything is révisable. (Here, there is a contrast as well between Dworkin's approach and the search for reflective equilibrium; because Hercules places a high premium on fit, it seems clear that he must take cases as given even if he would not agree with them in principle, though Dworkin is not entirely clear on this point.) The fact that precedents are fixed points helps to bring about an incompletely theorized convergence as well, by constraining the areas of reasonable disagreement. In this way, analogical reasoning introduces stability and predictability, which are im portant virtues for law. 
There is a larger point here. Lawyers could not try to reach reflective equilibrium without severely compromising the sys tem of precedent. The judgments at work in the search for reflective equilibrium are subject to critical scrutiny, and any of them might be discarded. The point helps explain Rawls's suggestion that "for the purposes of this book, the views of the reader and the author are the only ones that count. The opin ions of others are used only to clear our own heads."16 
In a legal system, precedents are far more than an effort "to clear our own heads." If a judge or a lawyer is to attempt to reach reflective equilibrium, precedents will have at most the status of considered judgments about particular cases, and these might be revised when they run into conflict with something else that he believes and that is general or particular. In the legal system, precedents have a much firmer status. To be sure, precedents are not immune to revision, but the principle of stare decisis ensures that they operate as relatively fixed points. 
I conclude that the search for reflective equilibrium is a mis leading description of law, and in some ways an unattractive prescription, for participants in a legal system aspiring to stabil ity should not be so immodest as to reject judgments reached by others whenever those judgments could not be made part of reflective equilibrium for those particular participants. Of On Legal Theory and Legal Practice 281 course, it is only a mixed blessing to have fixed points that may be wrong as a matter of principle. For this reason, observers of or participants in the legal system may be pushed in the direc tion of theoretical challenges to current legal materials. These challenges should hardly be disparaged; sometimes they pre vail, and rightly so. But legal practice often operates with a kind of consensus on theoretical issues, a consensus in which people who diverge on large-scale issues can agree on how to approach particular controversies. 
Now let us return to Hercules, who does not seek to achieve reflective equilibrium of the ordinary sort, acknowledging as he does that the existing legal materials must usually be accepted even if they seem wrong. Does Harlan have some advantages over Hercules? I think that he does. Insofar as Harlan avoids resort to large-scale theory, he not only avoids unrealistic expec tations for people engaged in law, but also promotes a system in which people who disagree on a great deal can converge on the particular judgments of which a system of adjudication must consist. This too is at best a mixed blessing. It may perpetuate errors. It may tolerate inequality and unfair treatment. But a blessing that is mixed is a blessing nonetheless. 
One additional note: Dworkin's conception of law contains an interesting account of what it means for law to be legitimate. Hercules can produce vertical and horizontal consistency among judgments of principle; Harlan can offer nothing so bold. A legal system that is incompletely theorized will not yield anything like coherence, and perhaps this is a decisive defect. 
A complete response would require more detail than I can offer here, but a few remarks are in order. Full theorization consists of much more than a legal system of numerous, hetero geneous, hierarchically arranged courts can be expected to of fer. Because of the need for predictability and stability in law, judges must reason from cases with which they disagree, and the resulting judgments are unlikely to be fully theorized. If this is so, a system of legal practice may well be able to claim the requisite legitimacy if it is democratic (broadly speaking) and if individual judges seek to produce the limited but important sorts of consistency that Harlan can yield. If this is correct, a system in which judges reason by analogy, and do not seek reflective equilibrium, might itself be justified as part of the reflective equilibrium reached by informed observers who take institutional issues into account. 
IV. A Final Challenge for Legal Practioners There is a final challenge to what I am describing as Justice Harlan's method, and this challenge bears directly on the rela tionship between theory and practice in law. The challenge would emphasize that Harlan's method, and especially his em phasis on incompletely theorized particulars, is necessary only because of our failure to develop general principles, which ought to be evaluated in their own right. The method of anal ogy, for example, is based on the question: Is case A relevantly similar to case B, or not? Is a ban on homosexual sodomy like a ban on the use of contraceptives in marriage, or like a ban on incest? We have seen that to answer such questions, one needs a theory of relevant similarities and differences. By itself, analogi cal reasoning supplies no such theory. It is thus dependent on an apparatus that it is unable to produce. 
In short, everything is a little bit similar to, or different from, everything else. Perhaps better: everything is similar in infinite ways to everything else, and also different from everything else in the same number of ways. Without a set of criteria to engage in analogical reasoning, one has no idea what is analogous to what. 
The first and most modest response to this idea is that judg ments in particular cases may be an important part of the devel opment of governing principles, which are often low-level. For example, it will be very hard to develop criteria or general theory without looking at the wide range of cases that raise free speech issues. This is certainly so for judges in a system of adjudication, and even more in a legislature during a period of enthusiasm for general rules. Specification of the general theory will be an extraordinarily difficult task. Often it cannot be de scribed, except at an uninformatively high and crude level of abstraction, in advance. 
Thus far I have suggested that Harlan's approach is helpful even if the criticism is fundamentally right: we do need princi On Legal Theory and Legal Practice 283 pies to decide cases; but this is not an objection to reasoning from particular cases, which helps us to decide what our (low level) principles are. But this humble point may establish only that analogies help us discover principles, which are in an ulti mate sense freestanding. In Kant's formulation, examples may be like walkers for children, helping people who are ethically immature to begin to orient themselves like adults.17 Thus "ca suistry is most suitable to the capacity of the undeveloped and so is the most appropriate way to sharpen the reason of young people in general."18 Convictions about particular cases—the stuff of practice—are like a ladder that can be discarded once we have climbed to the top. 
I think that this metaphor is misleading, because it suggests that the relevant convictions are dispensable in a way that they are not; particular judgments are not a ladder to be tossed away, but an important basis for our general principles. And as many have emphasized, some faculty is necessary to bring gen eral rules to bear on particular cases; often the application is far from mechanical. But a fuller response to this criticism will have to go deeper. I must be tentative about the point here, but the fuller defense would start with the claim that particular judgments about particular cases have a kind of priority in deciding what the law is or should be. My speculative suggestion is that correct answers in law might consist precisely of those particular judgments and these low-level principles, once these have been made (maximally) to cohere. The claim may extend beyond law to ethics and politics as well.19 
The claim may be right even if we acknowledge, as we should, that the effort to develop broader levels of abstraction is often a check against partiality and error in particular cases. In ethics as in law, judgments about particulars should be provi sional in the sense that sometimes they must be revised precisely because they cannot be squared with other judgments that are particular and general; but in certain endeavors, those particu lar judgments may deserve a kind of priority. They may deserve priority because they are more fully and carefully attuned to the multiple considerations likely to be at stake, and because general rules may be so broad and abstract as to ignore perti nent features of good judgment. Of course, nothing in this view amounts to a denial of the need for general principles and rules, to counteract bias, to minimize costs of decision, and to bring about the various virtues associated with the rule of law. 
Often, at least, general principles do seem inadequate to the matter at hand. Too many factors will be relevant, and too many variations will be possible, to allow a general formulation adequately to capture the range of right results in the cases. Sometimes any general theory will be too rigid and too inflexi ble. Part of the reason is that the relevant goods are diverse and plural, and most general theories are poorly attuned to this fact. In the law of free speech, for example, the Supreme Court has not offered a theory to account for its judgments. It has not explained what speech counts as "high value" and what speech falls in a lower tier. It is tempting to say that this is a major failure in constitutional law, and that the Court would do much better to tell us in plain terms what "test" it is using. But perhaps any test, described at a high level of generality, will be subject to decisive counterexamples, and will therefore be inadequate to the task. 
served by free speech—autonomy, development of the capaci ties, political liberty—and because diverse goods are unlikely to be well-captured by a highly general theory. Perhaps this is not true for the first amendment; it is possible that ( well enough, we would come up with a perfect general theory, or—a quite different point—that ( equately precise test might outweigh the disadvantages of hav ing no general theory at all. All I mean to suggest is that some times analogical reasoning might, in principle, be preferred to a general theory, simply because no such theory can adequately account for particular convictions, and because those convic tions, responsive as they are to the full range of interests legiti mately at stake, deserve priority in thinking about good out comes in law. 
This claim may be wrong; certainly I have not defended it adequately here. But if it is right, it may have large and incom pletely explored implications for the relationship among nor mative theory, operating through general theories, and what I 
am calling normative practice, operating modestly with low level convictions. 
Conclusion The practice of law is theory-laden. In their day-to-day work, many lawyers and judges are actually making theoretical claims. In some ways, it is most unfortunate that this point is not recog nized more often. The absence of self-consciousness about the theoretical claims may conceal those claims from view and make it harder to see that they represent a choice among plausible alternatives. The attack on legal formalism is above all an insis tence that legal work that purports to be mechanical is actually based on controversial substantive claims. Those claims ought to be brought out into the open and evaluated. 
But there are some advantages to the divorce of legal practice from legal theory. Analogical reasoning might be taken as a model for a process of thinking that is appropriately nonsectar ian and that tries to avoid large-scale claims about the right or the good. This approach is especially promising in light of the fact that it accomplishes a central task of a legal system and perhaps of normative practice generally: It enables people to converge on particular outcomes even though they disagree sharply on first principles. We might go further: Judgments about particular cases might deserve a kind of priority, or at least a distinguished place, in our thinking about law or even justice. It is unclear whether it is possible to have a form of legal practice that is agnostic on or largely independent of legal theory. But if this is possible, I contend that something of the sort suggested here is the place to start.

University Press, 1993), who suggests that in the search for reflective equilibrium, judgments at all level of generality are provisional and that no level has priority. 
I do not deal here with the fact that analogies may sometimes be a result of patterns that reach deep into cognitive processes, and that there is no identifiable "principle" to make one thing analogous to another but instead patterns that are constitutive of human reasoning. The cognitive role of judgments of analogy would take me far beyond the present discussion.

Many of the most difficult issues in law involve the choice between rules and rulelessness in cases where both seem unacceptable. The principal goal of this Article is to point the way toward a more refined understanding of the ideal of the rule of law, one that sees a degree of particularity,and a degree of law-making at the point of application, as importantparts of that ideal. The Article defends aform of casuistry and describes the potentially democraticfoundations of the casuistical enterprise in law. It begins by describingthe distinctiveadvantages ofrules and law via rules, especially as a meansfor providing a consensus on what the law is from people who disagree on much else. It also discusses three attacks on decisions accordingto rules: the view that rules are excessively conservative; the view that controversialpoliticaland moral claims always play a role in the interpretationof rules, and thus that rules are not what they appearto be; and the view that rules are obtuse because they are too crude to cover diverse human affairs, and becausejudges should not decide cases without closely inspecting the details of disputes. The Article suggests several ways to avoid the dilemmas posed by rules and rulelessness: (a) a presumption in favor ofprivately adaptable rules, that is, rules that allocate entitlements without specifying outcomes, in an effort to promote goals associatedwith free markets; (b) a recognitionoflegitimate rule revision, in which public officials andprivate citizens are allowed to soften the hardedges ofrules; and (c) highly contextualizedassessments ofthe virtues Copyright © 1994 California Law Review, Inc.

INTRODUCTION 
There are two stylized conceptions of legal judgment. The first, associated with Jeremy Bentham 4 and more recently with Justices Hugo Blackand Antonin Scalia,6 places a high premium on the creation and application of general rules. On this view, public authorities should avoid "balancing tests" or close attention to individual circumstances. They should attempt instead to give guidance to lower courts, future legislators, and citizens through clear, abstractrules laid down in advance of actual applications. 
The second conception, associated with William Blackstone and more recently with Justices Felix Frankfurter7 and John Marshall Harlan,8 places a high premium on law-making at the point of applicationthrough case-bycase decisions, narrowly tailored to the particulars of individual circum

Seizure Case"). 
stances. On this view, public authorities should stay close to the details of the controversy before them and avoid broader principles altogether. The problem with broad principles is that they tend to overreach; they may be erroneous or unreasonable as applied to cases not before the court.9 
It would be hard to overstate the importance of the controversy between the two views. The controversy arises in every area of law; 10 it often involves fundamental liberties. 1 Of course, familiar understandings of the rule of law prize, as a safeguard of freedom, broad rules laid down in advance; but the American legal system also values close attention to the details of each case. In every area of regulation-the environment, occupational safety and health, energy policy, communications, control of monopoly power-it is necessary to choose between general rules and case-bycase decisions. 
In its purest form, enthusiasm for genuinely case-specific decisions makes no sense. Few if any judgments about particular cases are entirely particular. Almost any judgment about a particular case depends on the use of principles or reasons. Any principles or reasons are, by their very nature, broader than the case for which they are designed. Case-by-case particularism is not a promising foundation for law. 
In many circumstances, however, enthusiasm for rules seems senseless too. Sometimes public authorities cannot design general rules, because they lack relevant information. Sometimes general rules will fail, because the legal system seeks subtle judgments about a range of particulars. Often general rules will be poorly suited to the new circumstances that will be turned up by unanticipated developments; often rulemakers cannot foresee the circumstances to which their rules will be applied. Often rules will be too crude, since they run up against intransigent beliefs about how particular cases should be resolved. 
One of my principal goals in this Article is to respond to a pervasive social phenomenon: extravagant enthusiasm for rules and an extravagantly rule-bound conception of the rule of law. 2 Case-by-case decisions are an important part of legal justice. We are familiar with a conception of procedural fairness based on rules. In this conception, people have a right to be told about prevailing requirements and a correlative right to test whether those requirements have been violated. But there is another, more particu9.

For an attack on extravagant enthusiasm for rules, overlaping with what I suggest here, see generally KENNET C. DAVIS ET AL., DISCRETIONARY JUSTICE IN EUROPE AND AMERICA (1976). laristic conception of procedural fairness, one that is also worthy of respect. Under that conception, people are entitled to argue that they are relevantly different from those that have come before, and that when their case is investigated in all its particularity, it will be shown that special treatment is warranted. On this view-with potentially democratic foundations-people who are affected by rules should be allowed to participate in the creation of the very rule to be applied to their case. 13 
I argue here that the disadvantages of rules and rule-bound justice are often insufficiently appreciated, and that legal systems sometimes do and should abandon rules in favor of a form of casuistry.4 In the casuistic enterprise, judgments are based not on a preexisting rule, but on comparisons between the case at hand and other cases, especially those that are unambiguously within a generally accepted norm. Bounded rationality-in the form of ignorance about relevant facts, values, and future developments or circumstances-provides an important reason for proceeding in this way. When people lack sufficient information to design (satisfactory or sufficiently finely tuned) rules, they might resort to case analysis instead. But bounded rationality is not the only problem. The argument for case analysis depends as well on the diversity and plurality of values. t5 These ideas have an obvious bearing on law, and they have consequences for ethics, too, though I will not discuss ethical issues here. 
I urge as well that both the old art of casuistry and the old domain of equity can be given democratic foundations. A legal system committed to casuistry might insist that every litigant is entitled to urge that he is distinctive, that he deserves distinctive treatment, and that his claims to this effect warrant a public response. Insofar as a legal system recognizes this claim, its form of casuistry embodies norms of participation and responsiveness. Such a system also seeks to ensure against premature judicial foreclosure of issues that should be subject to democratic deliberation. 
I do not deny that quite serious risks are associated with any effort to proceed through case-by-case judgments. These risks include the abusive exercise of discretion, lack of predictability or of the capacity to form expectations, high costs of decisions, failure of political accountability, and much more. As a way of reducing those risks, we might evaluate solutions through both economic and democratic criteria. For this reason I argue against an ingenious solution proposed by Jeremy Bentham,"6 and suggest instead three principal alternatives. The first is founded principally in market rather than democratic norms. It involves a presumption in favor of ETmics AND ECONOMICS (1993) (discussing plural values);. 
Law, 97 HARV. L. REV. 625 (1984). 
PROBLEMS WiTH RULES what I will call privately adaptablerules-rulesthat allocate initial entitlements but do not specify end-states, and that harness private forces to determine outcomes. Such rules can help break through some of the dilemmas posed by the choice between rules and rulelessness; the crudeness of rules is alleviated by virtue of the power of private adaptation to particular circumstances. Allowing the remedy of "exit" rather than "voice," " privately adaptable rules are typically invoked in support of economic markets. I argue here that they also deserve an honored place in a legal system committed to correcting the operation of economic markets. 
The second approach involves legitimate rule revisions. It recognizes that officials and citizens sometimes have the power to moderate rules, or applications of rules, that no longer make sense. Juries, police, and prosecutors all have some power to revise rules. Ordinary people sometimes exercise this power as well. 
The third approach is pragmatic and more self-consciously casuistical; its major goal is to make space for the democratic goals of participation and responsiveness that I have just described. This last approach involves a highly contextualized inquiry into the levels and kinds of error and injustice via rules or via rulelessness, with special attention to the nature of the forum that will be making the crucial decisions. Rules cannot be favored or disfavored in the abstract; everything depends on whether, in context, rules are superior to the alternatives. It is therefore important to know something about the character of the institutions that will give rise to rules in the first instance or apply them after the fact.

SouRcEs OF LAW 
Law has a toolbox containing many devices. Lawyers have customarily compared standards ("do not drive unreasonably fast") to rules ("do not go over 60 miles per hour"), with rules seeming hard and fast, and standards seeming open-ended. 8 There are indeed differences between rules and standards. But the rules-versus-standards debate captures only a part of what is at stake, and it is important to have a fuller sense of the repertoire of available devices. In this section I outline a number of these devices; my goal is to clarify some terms that will come up throughout the discussion. 
First, however, a cautionary note. Whether a legal provision is a rule, a presumption, a principle, a standard, a guideline, a set of factors-or something else-cannot be decided in the abstract. Everything depends on the understandings and practices of the people who interpret the provision. Interpretive practices can convert an apparently rule-like provision into something very unrule-like. The American Constitution, for example, says that "Congress shall make no law ...abridging the freedom of speech."' 9 This provision might operate as a rule if people take it as a flat ban on certain sorts of regulations. It could operate as a presumption if people see it as saying that Congress can regulate speech only if it makes a demonstration of harm of certain kinds and degrees. Or it could be understood as a set of factors: once we parse notions like "abridging" and "the freedom of speech," perhaps we will decide cases on the basis of an inquiry into two, three, or more relevant considerations.2 0 The content and nature of a legal provision cannot be read off the provision. It is necessary to see what people take it to be. 
For this reason we should distinguish among three kinds of actors. The first is the person or institution that issues the relevant legal provision. The second is the person or institution that is subject to the provision. The third is the person or institution charged with the power to interpret the provision. If we take a rule to be a provision that minimizes law-making power in particular cases, 2' a lawmaker may intend to issue a rule, but the interpretive practices of the interpreting institution may turn the provision into something very different. Whether a provision is a rule or not is a function of interpretive practices. The lawmaker has only limited power over those practices. 
A. 
By "untrammeled discretion," I mean the capacity to exercise official power as one chooses, by reference to such considerations as one wants to consider, weighted as one wants to weight them. A legal system cannot avoid some degree of discretion, in the form of power to choose according to one's moral or political convictions.22 As we will see, the interpretation of seemingly rigid rules usually allows for discretion. But a legal system can certainly make choices about how much discretion it wants various people to have. 
A system of untrammeled discretion exists when there are no limits on what officials may consider in reaching a decision and on how much weight various considerations deserve; hence there are no limits on the officials' power to decide what to do. Both inputs and outputs are unconstrained. In the real world, untrammeled discretion is quite rare. Even people with considerable discretion usually understand that some factors are irrelevant in light of their roles. In practice, however, some police officers may come very close to exercising untrammeled discretion in light of the practical unavailability of review. 

As we will soon see, it is too simple to oppose rules to discretion. Interpretation of rules necessarily involves discretion, and so-called discretion is rarely untrammeled in the legal context. 
Often a system of rules is thought to be the polar opposite of a system of untrammeled discretion. As I have noted, there is no such polar opposition. Provisions that appear to be rules may not eliminate discretion. There is a continuum from rules to untrammeled discretion, with factors, guidelines, and standards falling in between. 
The key characteristic of rules is that they attempt to specify outcomes before particular cases arise. Rules are largely defined by the ex ante character of law.23 By the aspiration to a system of rules, I therefore mean to refer to something very simple: approachesto law that try to make most or nearly all legaljudgments under the governing legalprovision in advance of actual cases.2 4 We have rules, or (better) "rule-ness," to the extent that the content of the law has been set down in advance of applications of the law. In the extreme case, all of the content of the law is given before cases arise. This is an ambitious goal-impossibly ambitious. As we will see, no approach to law is likely to avoid allowing at least some legal judgments to be made in the context of deciding actual cases. 25 Rules do not, and indeed cannot, contain all of the instructions necessary for their own interpretation. Nonetheless, it is possible to ensure that a wide range of judgments about particular cases will occur before the point of application. 
On this view, we have a rule, or rule-ness, to the extent that decisions about cases have been made ex ante rather than ex post. If a key function of law is to assign entitlements, a rule can thus be defined as the full or control of the judge-as in "the outcome depends on what the Pope says" or "an amount not higher than Frank Thomas' batting average." These are rules, but their content is not supplied in advance. This point shows that an alternative definition of rules could look to the extent to which the relevant criteria are easy to ascertain for individual cases. See Stephen McG. Bundy & Einer R. Elhauge, Knowledge About LegalSanctions, 92 MICH. L. REv. 261,271 n.25 (1993). On this view, rules cannot exist where it is hard to know relevant criteria. One source of uncertainty would be discretion to make decisions ex post, but uncertainty could also arise if, for example, an adjudication under provisions specified ex ante would depend on certain facts that are hard to ascertain. Consider, for example, the ban on insider trading under Rule 10(b)(5) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1933, which is well-specified ex ante, but which requires determinations of knowledge, materiality, and so forth that cannot be made easily and that will depend on educated, but error-prone, guesses. See id., supra, at 270-71. For some purposes, the "easy to ascertain criteria" conception of rules is preferable to the "ex ante specification" conception, especially if we are concerned with predictability. While the two conceptions overlap, the latter is a bit easier to describe and work with, and therefore I use it here.

(2d ed. 1994), infra at text accompanying notes 100-101. nearly full ex ante assignment of legal entitlements, or the complete or nearly complete ex ante specification of legal outcomes. 
When a rule is in play, the decision of cases does not depend on ex post assignments, as it likely does under a standard-understood to operate when, for example, a judge decides whether someone is liable for nuisance by determining whether his conduct was "unreasonable" (assuming this term has not been given precise content in advance) or when a judge decides whether a restriction on abortion imposes an "undue burden" 6 (making the same assumption). In the purest case, the responsibility of the decision-maker is to find only the facts; the law need not be found. When rules are operating, an assessment of facts, combined with an ordinary understanding of grammar, semantics, and diction-and of conventions and more substantive ideas on which there is no dispute-is usually sufficient to decide the case. 
Rules may be simple or complex. A law could say, for example, that no one under eighteen may drive. It could be somewhat more complex, saying that people under eighteen may not drive unless they pass certain special tests. Or it could be quite complex, creating aformula for deciding who may drive. It might look, for example, to age, performance on a written examination, and performance on a driving test. Each of these three variables might be given a specified numerical weight. 
Rules can also be specific or abstract. Specific rules apply to a narrow class of cases; abstract rules apply to a broad class of cases. An abstract rule might say, for example, that no one may drive over sixty miles per hour or that all cars must be equipped with catalytic converters. A specific rule might say that President Nixon's papers are public property; that the First Amendment allows government to ban advertisements for casino gambling when gambling has been unlawful in the recent past; or that sixth-grade students may be suspended without a hearing for a period of less than two weeks, if there has been a serious allegation of criminal activity. All rules are defined in terms of classes, but sometimes the rule is narrowly tailored so as to pick up only a few cases, or perhaps only one. 
It is familiar to find rules that have explicit or implicit exceptions for cases of necessity or emergency. It is unfamiliar to find rules without any such exceptions. For example, a person may be banned from taking the life of another; this is a rule, but self-defense is a valid excuse. Many constitutions allow abridgements of individual rights in case of emergency. The American Constitution allows the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in time of war.' Other constitutions say that certain rights can be abridged under unusual circumstances.28 
The consequences of making exceptions depend on the details. An exception could be narrow but vague, as in the idea that reasonable limits on free speech can be made only under conditions of war. The conditions are rare and the exception therefore narrow, but the meaning of the exception is vague (what are "reasonable limits?"). Or the exception could be narrow and specific, as in the idea that under conditions of war, members of the Communist party may not work for the military in any capacity. An exception might be broad and vague or broad and specific. A specific exception might well convert the rule with exceptions into a complex rule or a formula. 
A legal system may contain presumptions or presumptive rules. The law may presume, for example, that when the government regulates speech on the basis of its content, the regulation is unconstitutional. 29 But the presumption might be rebutted by claims of a certain kind and strength, as when government can show a clear and present danger. The law might presume that an employer may not discriminate on the basis of race; but the presumption might be rebutted by a showing that, for example, a black actor is necessary to play the part of Othello. 
The legal system is pervaded by rules that operate as presumptions and that can be countered by showings of a particular kind and degree. The line between presumptions and rules with emergency exceptions can be thin. A rule with necessity or emergency exceptions might be described, somewhat imprecisely, as a strong presumption. With presumptions, it is necessary to know what counts as a rebuttal, and whether the presumption and the rebuttal are specific or vague, broad or narrow. 
We might contrast both untrammeled discretion and rule-bound procedures with approaches that allow particular judgments to emerge through the decision-maker'sassessment and weighing of a number ofrelevantfactors, whose precise content has not been specified in advance3.0 The key point is that several factors are pertinent to the decision, but there is no rule, suspended unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.").

scrutiny" of content-based regulation of speech). 
notes 157-190 and accompanying text (discussing judgments based on factors). simple or complex, to apply. There is no rule because the factors are not described exhaustively and precisely in advance, and because their weight has not been fully specified. Hence the decision-maker cannot rely simply on "finding the facts" and "applying the law." The content of the law is not given; part of it must be found. There is a degree of ex post allocation of legal entitlements. 
On this score, the difference between rules and factors is one of degree rather than kind. As we will see, those who interpret provisions that appear to be rules may be required to determine at least some of their content. In a system of factors, moreover, the decision-maker cannot do whatever she wants. But under a system of factors, the content of the law is created in large part by those who must apply it to particular cases, and not by people who laid it down in advance. To a considerable extent, we do not know what the law is until the particular cases arise. 
regulated pricing and allocation of petroleum products from 1973 to 1981. The statute required the agency to "provide for" nine factors, "to the maximum extent practicable." 3' These factors were (1) protection of public health, safety, and welfare; ( maintenance of agricultural operations; (4) preservation of an economically sound and competitive petroleum industry; (5) operation of all refineries at full capacity; (6) equitable distribution of crude oil and petroleum products; (7) maintenance of exploration for and production of fuels; (8) economic efficiency; and (9) minimization of interference with market mechanisms.32 
Congress added that each of the nine factors is equally important. There is much to be said about this quite bizarre list. What is important here is that an enumeration of factors may be possible. 
In most contexts, however, any given list of relevant factors is not exhaustive. Life may turn up other relevant factors that are hard or impossible to identify in advance. In most areas of law governed by factors rather than rules, it is understood that the identified factors, if described at a level of specificity, are not complete-or that if they are intended to be complete, they are stated in a sufficiently general and abstract way, so as to allow unanticipated, additional considerations to apply. 
F. 
Rules are often compared with standards.3 3 A ban on "excessive" speeds on the highway is familiarly thought to involve a standard; so too with a requirement that pilots be "competent," or that behavior in the classroom be "reasonable." As standards, these might be compared with rules: a fifty-five miles per hour speed limit, a ban on pilots over the age of seventy, or a requirement that students sit in particular, assigned seats. 
The contrast between rules and standards is quite useful. It identifies the fact that with some legal provisions, interpreters have to do a great deal of work in order to generate the necessary content for a legal provision. With a standard, it is not possible to know what we have in advance. This can be a decisive political advantage: Sometimes people can agree on a standard when they cannot agree on its specification. An incompletely specified provision may be the best the political (or judicial) system can do, as with many constitutional provisions and many standards governing administrative agencies. 
The meaning of a standard depends on what happens with its applications. Standards share with factors a refusal to specify outcomes in advance. Standards depart from factors in refusing to enumerate considerations that are relevant in particular applications.3 4 It would not be accurate, however, to say that standards offer more discretion than factors. The amount of discretion depends on the context and on the nature of the particular factors and standards. 
Here too, moreover, the character of the provision cannot be read off its text, and everything will depend on interpretive practices. Once we define the term "excessive," we may well end up with a rule. Perhaps officials will decide that a speed is excessive when and only when it is over sixty miles per hour. If a standard is transparent, in the sense that there is a clear ex ante understanding of its meaning, it is a rule. We may instead end up with a set of factors or a presumption. Perhaps anyone who goes over sixty miles per hour will be presumed to have gone excessively fast, unless special circumstances are shown. Or perhaps the judgment about excessive speed will be based on need, weather conditions, traffic, time of day, and so forth. It is a familiar hope that standards will receive a degree of specification as they are interpreted, since officials may generate categories of cases that, under the standard, receive predictable treatment. 35 
G. 
Avoiding factors, rules, or standards, the law might establish ceilings and floors, or it might identify positions from which officials or citizens may deviate if they can demonstrate good cause. Guidelines of this sort may be mandatory or they may be merely suggestive. Mandatory guide34. See Kaplow, supra note 24, at 559-60. 
Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.). lines3 6 may be preferred to rules because they allow a degree of flexibility; they may be preferred to standards insofar as they can discipline behavior in a way that allows better monitoring of discretion. Thus guidelines may establish firm boundaries beyond which no one may go, and they may require reasons to be given publicly for any departure from the norm. On the other hand, the flexibility of guidelines may be a vice rather than a virtue. 
H. 
Principles are not an alternative to rules, factors, guidelines, or standards. Their legal status is obscure, in part because the term "principles" refers to several different phenomena. In law, principles are often said to be both deeper and more general than rules.37 We might say that rules are justified by principles, usually political or moral in character. The justification of the rule might be used to interpret its meaning; courts may resort to the principle in trying to understand the rule. For example, there is a (moral) principle to the effect that it is wrong to take human life without sufficient cause; the law implements this principle with a range of rules prohibiting homicide. Similarly, there is a (moral) principle to the effect that it is wrong not to keep your promises; the law contains a range of rules for enforcement of contractual obligations. Commonly, the term "principle" in law refers to the moral or political justifications behind rules. 
There is another and quite different understanding of the notion of principle in law. Any legal system contains explicitly formulated (legal) principles as well as rules; these principles do not lie behind rules but instead are brought to bear on the resolution of cases.3 1 Thus it is said that no person may profit from his own wrong; that he who seeks equity must do equity; that ambiguous statutes should be construed so as not to apply outside the territorial boundaries of the United States. 39 The status of legal principles is somewhat mysterious; they differ in weight, ranging from strong presumptions to tie-breakers when cases are otherwise in equipoise.40 Sometimes they operate as factors. But principles are not rules. We might say that principles are more flexible than rules, in the sense that principles tend to bear on cases without disposing of them.4 1 This distinc36. One example is the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. See generally UNITED STATES SENTENCING COMMISSION, FEDERAL SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL (West 1994). 
between laws and legal principles used by courts, for instance to invalidate laws). 
William N. Eskridge, Jr. & Philip P. Frickey, Foreword:Law as Equilibrium, 108 HARV. L. Rv. 26, 97-98 (1994). 
tion should not be overstated.42 Any given rule X is unlikely to resolve all cases that fall under the literal language of rule X 43 and principles can be crucial to the disposition of cases. 
What is the relationship between a principle and a standard? If we see a principle as the justification for a rule, the difference seems obvious: a standard is not a justification for an (already specified) rule, but instead a legal provision that needs a good deal of specification to be used to resolve individual cases. If, however, we understand a principle to be a relevant consideration in the decision of cases, the distinction between principles and standards is more complex. As I understand it here, a legal principle is different from a legal standard in the sense that the latter "covers" individual cases without specifying the content of the analysis in particular instances, whereas a principle is a background notion that does not by itself cover an individual case, but is instead brought to bear on it as a relevant consideration. This is a lamentably vague formulation, but the distinction should make intuitive sense. Compare a standard banning unreasonable risks with a principle that statutes should be construed to avoid constitutional doubts.' 
One final complication. A decision in a case sometimes seems to turn on a "principle," as in the idea that speech may not be restricted unless there is a clear and present danger, or that discrimination on the basis of race is presumed invalid, or that no contract is valid without consideration. In this usage, a principle is not distinguishable from a standard or a presumption, and at some points below, I will use the terms interchangeably. 
I. 
The last category is not a simple alternative to the others, but it is quite an important tool that helps provide a clue to how law often operates. Sometimes a legal system proceeds by comparing the case at hand to a case (or to cases) that have come before.4" The prior case is inspected to see whether it "controls," or should be extended to, the case at hand. The prior case will be accompanied by an opinion, which may contain a rule, a standard, a set of factors, or something else. The court deciding the present case will inspect relevant similarities and differences. That court, not bound by the previous opinion, may produce a rule, a standard, a set of factors, or something else. With analogy, we do not have a decision by rule, because the rule is not specified in advance of the process of analogical thinking. 
When courts proceed with analogies, then, the nature of the legal provision-its content and even its character as a rule, a standard, a set of factors, or a guideline-is not known before the analogical process takes place. The nature of the provision is specified in the case at hand by grappling with the precedent; we do not know what we have before the grappling occurs. It is unusual, however, for analogical thinking to yield rules. Most of the time, an analogy will produce a standard, one that makes sense of the outcomes in the case at hand and the case that came before.4 6 
II 
RULES AND THE RULE OF LAW 
A system of rules is often thought to be the signal virtue of a system of law. Indeed, the rule of law might seem to require a system of rules.47 The idea has a constitutional source. The due process clause of the American Constitution is sometimes interpreted so as to require rules, or rule-like provisions, and to forbid a system based on analogies, standards, or factors.48 This is particularly important in the areas of criminal justice and freedom of speech, where the "void for vagueness" doctrine requires the state to set forth clear guidance before it may punish private conduct.49 
specifically does the concept of the rule of law entail? It is possible to identify several characteristics. 50 A system committed to the rule of law seems to require (1) clear, general, publicly accessible rules laid down in advance; ( between law in the books and law in the world;5 ' (4) hearing rights and availability of review by independent adjudicative officials; (5) separation between law-making and law-implementation; (6) no rapid changes in the content of law; and (7) no contradictions or inconsistency in the law. These are the customary characteristics of a system committed to the rule of law. Of course, no legal system is likely to comply with these seven goals; failures of the rule of law, understood in such terms, are commonplace. 
A particular advantage of a system of rules is that people who disagree on much else may nonetheless agree about the meaning of a rule. A rule that forbids people from going over fifty-five miles per hour has the same meaning to Republicans and Democrats, libertarians and socialists, anarchists and members of the Ku Klux Klan. When a rule of law is in place, people can know what the rules are without adverting to basic principles. Indeed, adverting to basic principles is generally illegitimate, short of civil disobedience. 
This is an oversimplification, as we will see.52 Disagreements about basic principles may break out in disputes over the meaning of rules. But the oversimplification contains fundamental truth. And in this oversimplification also lies some of the enduring truth of legal positivism, the lawpolitics distinction, and the view that ours is a government of law, not human beings. 
III 
THE CASE FOR RULEs 
A great virtue of rules is that they circumscribe permissible grounds for both action and argument; by doing so, they reduce costs of many diverse kinds. In a heterogeneous society containing people of limited time and capacities, this is an enormous advantage. I am suggesting that rules can help people cope with pluralism (even though the existence of pluralism can make it difficult to generate rules.)5" Once generated, rules save a great deal of effort, time, and expense. By truncating the sorts of value disputes that can arise in law, rules also ensure that disagreements will occur along a narrowly restricted range. 
I now discuss some of the characteristic virtues of decisions according to rules. First, however, it is important to note that rules fall in several different categories. Here is a nonexhaustive account, tied to my special concerns. 
the grounds that they are a good summary, and that they are desirable as rules, rather than mere advice or rules of thumb, so as to save the costs of making individualized decisions. These costs involve time, labor, and risk of error. Of course, a rule that counts as a summary of wise decisions iay operate, for good pragmatic reasons, not as a rule of thumb but as a truly mandatory rule-one that cannot be revisited during particular applications. If people over the age of sixty are banned from being commercial pilots, it is because this is probably a pretty accurate summary of good individual decisions, and far less costly to administer than any alternative. (Consider the expenditures that would be required to assess competence in every case.) If we say that people with SAT scores below 500 will not be admitted to a certain college, it is for a similar reason. 
coordinate their behavior so as to overcome collective action problems. This is true, for example, with respect to rules of the road. The rule that people must drive on the right-hand side of the road is valuable because it tells people where to drive, not because it is any better than its opposite. We do not think that people must drive on the right because it is a wise decision, in the individual case unaccompanied by rules, to drive on the right. So too, rules may solve prisoner's dilemmas, in which a series of individually rational decisions can lead to social irrationality or even disaster. The rules governing emission of pollutants are an example. If each polluter felt free to revisit the justification for the rules, the prisoner's dilemma might not be solved. The best solution is probably to fix a rule and to require everyone to adhere to it. 
who may marry whom, for example, say something about the institution of marriage and about social convictions about who is entitled to public recognition of a relational commitment. Three people cannot be married, nor can people of the same sex. These rules do not summarize individually wise decisions, but instead express a social judgment about relations and valuations. We might say that the expressive function of law includes the effects of law on social attitudes about relationships, events, and prospects, and also the "statement" that law makes independently of such effects. 5 Of course, some such statements and expressions might be challenged. 
overcome the problems of myopia, lack of information, weakness of will, or time inconsistency. Suppose that in order to succeed in your plans, you need to engage in consistent behavior over time. Perhaps an exercise program requires you to work out for one hour, and just one hour, every day; or perhaps a good diet requires you to eat the same things, more or less, at the same time for a given period. In these circumstances, a rule that is enforceable through some mechanism-perhaps social sanctions-may be the best way to proceed. 
Societies face similar problems. Perhaps good monetary policy for a certain period requires the Federal Reserve Board to do the same thing each month; suppose that without a rule, and with particularized consideration of what to do each month, the Board would do inconsistent things. Adoption 82024 (1994). 
REv. 1, 66-71 (1995). of a rule may ensure the requisite consistency. In this way, a rule may be a precommitment strategy that overcomes predictable problems with ruleless decisions.5 6 
among people who disagree on questions of theory or on fundamental values.57 Rules might do this in three different ways. First, people can sometimes agree that a rule is binding, or authoritative, without agreeing on a high theory of why it is binding, and without agreeing that the rule is good. Theories of legitimate authority are highly pluralistic, and acceptance of rules can proceed from diverse foundations5. 8 
Second, people can sometimes converge on a particular rule without taking a stand on large issues of the right or the good. The rule of stare decisis-acceptanceof precedents -is a familiar example; we can accept that rule from diverse theoretical perspectives. So too, people can urge a sixty miles per hour speed limit, a prohibition on bringing elephants into restaurants, a ten-year minimum sentence for homicide, and much more without taking a stand on debates between Kantians and utilitarians, and indeed without offering much in the way of general theory at all.59 Of course acceptance of any legal provision requires a reason or a principle; my point is only that a wide range of starting points can sometimes yield the same rule and even the same reason or principle, so long as these are described at a low or intermediate level of generality. When legislatures and bureaucracies issue rules, they often do so without getting into highlevel theory.60 
Third, people may agree on the meaning of a rule despite their disagreement on much else. Rules also sharply diminish the level of disagreement among people who are subject to them, and among people who must interpret and apply them. Once a rule is in place, large-scale theories need not be invoked in order for us to know what the rule means, and whether it is binding. This generalization is a bit crude; 6' but it is fundamentally right. In the following section, I am concerned principally with the advantages of representatives' own political commitments or electoral self-interest. Similar considerations apply to a decentralized, hierarchical judiciary. In such a system, there will be some incentive for the Supreme Court to avoid making rules and to transfer the costs of rulelessness to others. 194 But the incentive can be overcome by other considerations. 
Some of these speculations are borne out by comparing the legal system in England with that in the United States.' 9 5 In England, lawmaking and law-interpretation are far more rule-bound than in the United States. The Parliament is less likely to delegate discretionary authority to judges.1 96 For their part, English judges treat statutes as rules, interpreting them literally and sometimes refusing to investigate whether the particular application of the rule makes sense as a matter of policy or principle.' 9 7 In contrast, in the United States, lawmaking often takes place in the process of confrontation with particular cases.' 98 
How might this be explained? Is it possible to say that one or the other nation is proceeding more sensibly? Perhaps not; perhaps the differences are attributable to contextual differences.' 99 It is notable that laws in England are drafted by an Office of Parliamentary Counsel, a highly professional body that consists of skilled authors of laws.2 00 The Parliamentary Counsel brings about a uniform style of drafting. It is also closely attuned to the interpretive methods of English judges, and the Counsel drafts legislation with close knowledge of literalism and of the prevailing canons of construction.20 ' The judges' practice is itself uniform and relatively simple. In a parliamentary system, the government and the legislature are allied, and the high degree of party control means that there is a level of homogeneity in England at the lawmaking stage.2 °2 Moreover, and critically, Parliament revisits statutes with some frequency, and it fixes mistakes that are shown as such when particular cases arise.20 3 
The situation in the United States is very different. There is no centralized drafting body, and hence no uniformity in terminology, and little professionalization. In America, the drafters of legislation are multiple and uncoordinated.2 °4 The party system imposes less discipline, and the executive and legislature are hardly aligned.20 5 Congress appears only intermittently aware of the judges' interpretive practices, which are themselves not easy to describe in light of the sheer size of the federal judiciary and the existence of sharp splits, on just this point, in the Supreme Court. Congress does overrule statutory decisions to which it objects.20 6 But it is not in the business of responding rapidly and regularly to particular cases in which literal interpretations misfire. Hence both lawmaking and law-interpreting practice are very different from what they are in England. 
This brief description of the two systems supports the contextual arguments offered above. There tends to be more disagreement in America than in England at the lawmaking stage. In America, the quality of drafting ex ante is lower, as is the possibility of legislative correction ex post. None of this suggests that England or America has the optimal level of rules in light of its own institutional characteristics. None of this suggests that interpretive practices in the relevant nations are immune from challenge. But it does suggest that the two legal systems are highly responsive to distinctive contextual features.

REFORM STRATEGIES 
How can a legal system minimize the problems posed by unreasonable generality on the one hand and those of potentially abusive discretion on the other? The best approaches involve (a) a highly contextualized, indeed casuistical inquiry into the likelihood of error and abuse with either rules or rulelessness, and hence an "on balance" judgment about risk; (b) a large space for legitimate rule revisions; and (c) a presumption in favor of a particular kind of rule, that is, the privately adaptablerule that allocates initial entitlements but does not specify outcomes. 
A. 
Jeremy Bentham favored clear rules, laid down in advance and broadly communicated.2" 7 In at least some of his writings, he also favored adjudicative flexibility, allowing judges to adapt rules to the complexities of individual cases.20 8 Bentham was aware that rules could misfire as they encountered particular controversies, especially if we understand the notion 
generallyWilliam N. Eskridge, Jr., OverrulingSupreme CourtStatutory InterpretationDecisions, 101 YALE L.J. 331 (1991). 
of misfiring in utilitarian terms.20 9 In courts of law, Bentham concluded, the rules should not be fully binding.210 
This suggests a paradox: How could someone advocate clear rules without asking judges to follow them? Bentham's ingenious answer involved the different audiencesfor law. The public should hear general rules; the judges should hear individual cases. 2 11 This is the important idea of an "acoustic separation" for legal terms,2 12 justified on utilitarian grounds. There is such a separation in many areas of law, including the law relating to excuses for criminality, and perhaps in tax law as well.2 13 
Following this idea, we might suggest that legislatures should lay down rigid rules for the public-"conduct rules"--but that interpreters should feel free to ignore them in contexts where they produce absurdity. Officials might follow more flexible "decision rules" that deviate from conduct rules and indeed that work as standards. In some ways this is the American legal practice. 2 14 American judges do not create systematic deviations between conduct rules and decision rules; but they do make exceptions to literal language in cases of absurdity. Of course it is important to develop subsidiary principles to discipline the development of decision rules and the general idea of "absurdity," and to give these ideas concrete application in the modem regulatory state. Modem administrative agencies, more than courts, might be entrusted with the job of adapting general rules to particular circumstances.2 1S 
There are, however, two large difficulties with the Benthamite strategy. The first involves the right to democratic publicity-more particularly, the right to know what the law is. The Benthamite strategy severely compromises that right. The rule of law-and democratic values-would be jeopardized if people are unaware that the law is not what the statute books say that it is. Benthamite approaches are therefore unacceptable to the extent that utilitarian judgments about acoustic separation run into liberal principles of publicity.2 16 In a similar vein we might think that it is an insult to the moral autonomy of the citizenry to be told that the law is something other than what it is in fact. There is a serious problem from the standpoint of democratic citizenship, since members of the polity, given the right and duty to decide on the content of law, will by hypothesis lack knowledge of what the law really is. This ignorance will compromise the process of democratic assessment of law. 
CoLum. L. Rev. 2071 (1990). 

The second problem with the Benthamite strategy is that it fails to take account of the fact that general rules can create bad private incentives as compared with more contextualized approaches. Consider, for example, a speed limit that creates improper incentives in cases in which speeding is necessary to save (the optimal level of) life and limb, or an environmental regulation that requires adoption of expensive technology in cases in which the environmental risks are trivial.2 17 The secrecy of the Benthamite approach-the distinction between the law as it is publicly known and the law as it operates in courts of law-will do nothing at all about the problem of bad incentives from crude rules. Indeed, publicizing the exceptions, and telling everyone about the possibility of close judicial attention to the particulars of your case, may well be a good idea if we seek optimal incentives. At least this would be so if people would not react to the presence of exceptions by believing that they can do whatever they want and that the rule effectively does not exist at all. 
Too often, then, the Benthamite strategy is neither democratic nor efficient. But there is still a place for what might be thought to be a version of it. A legal system might sometimes provide that in exceptional cases, interpreters should be permitted to change rules, by exploring whether their justifications create absurdity or injustice in particular cases.2 18 We might even see a judicial (or administrative) power of this kind as part of the interpretation of rules, not as an authority to change rules. This power should be publicly known-a fully disclosed aspect of interpretation. In some contexts, of course, the possibility of changing rules, or of interpreting them with close reference to whether they make sense in particular circumstances, might be too damaging to the project of rule-following. But this judgment cannot be made in the abstract. 
B. 
Many legal systems allow people to deviate from rules in certain circumstances. Indeed, many public officials have at least a tacit power to revise the rules when rule-following would be senseless. Citizens as a whole often have the same power.219 Legitimate rule revisions make rules "on the books" operate differently from how they appear. Moreover, rule revisions can help promote the democratic character of the law, by allowing constraints on the application of rules to cases where they no longer fit with public convictions. 
The class of legitimate official revisions is large; it helps supplement legislation with a set of post-enactment, or extra-enactment, constraints on REv. 1333, 1335 (1985). 

SANFoRD H. KADIsH, DISCRETION TO Disoaa" (1973). what government may do. Consider the fact that juries sometimes "nullify"' outcomes that the law, if interpreted in a rule-bound way, seems to mandate. 2 ° The practice of jury nullification is widely understood as legitimate, 22 ' so long as it does not occur very often. There is a democratic justification for the practice: it allows a salutary public check on rules, or applications of rules, that produce unjust or irrational outcomes. 
So, too, police have a widely acknowledged authority to revise rules, by deciding which crimes warrant arrest, and criminal prosecutors have a widely acknowledged authority to revise rules, by refusing to punish certain rule violations. In exercising this authority, police and prosecutors may legitimately depart from rules governing private behavior. Officials refuse to punish conduct that, while violative of rules on the book, is not widely perceived as deserving criminal punishment. Prosecutions are rarely brought for sodomy or adultery, in part because such behavior, even if condemned, is no longer so deplored as to call for jail sentences or criminal fines. We might also understand judicial "softening" or "moderation" of rules-sometimes under the guise of interpretation uuu -as an exercise of a tacitly legitimated authority to reject rules when they make no sense. 
Of course, people might question these various exercises of discretion to depart from rules. If, for example, the police refuse to stop domestic violence-because they think that spousal abuse is acceptable or that government should not intervene in the family-we might respond that the refusal is unacceptable, because it produces injustice. The judgments that underlie rule revisions might properly be criticized as confused or unjust. I am suggesting only that when there is no such problem, the revisions, if democratically grounded, are a good response to the problems posed by rule-bound law. 
Certainly the existence of enforcement discretion raises doubts about certain understandings of the rule of law.3 If what I am saying is right, there will often be a gap between law on the books and law in the world, and for good democratic reasons. We might conclude that officials in certain social roles-jurors, prosecutors, police-should believe that rules are generally binding, but that they have authority to depart from the rules in compelling circumstances. This authority has democratic foundations; it might promote liberty as well. 
Now let us turn to the situation of the citizen. Ordinarily we think that people must obey the law or face the consequences of violating it. If they are conscientious objectors-consider as examples Martin Luther King, Jr., or abortion protestors-their violation of the law may be a product of 
43 LAW & CoNTEMP. PROBS. 51 (1980). 
deeply felt moral judgments, or even heroic; but they must nonetheless face the consequences. This picture has much truth in it, but it is too simple. Often citizens, like officials, are authorized to depart from the rules. 
Consider, for example, the fact that citizens who object to the constitutionality of a rule are permitted to violate the rule and seek a judicial judgment on the constitutional issue. Since there is an overlap between moral argument and constitutional argument, the power to test rules against constitutional standards might well be seen as a power to ask that rules be revised when they are especially unjust. 
Perhaps this power should not be treated as a genuine power to revise rules, since the Constitution is part of the rules of the American legal system. But citizens have other powers as well, and these powers should certainly be understood as a power to change or to soften rules. Consider the fact that people are allowed to depart from the rules in cases of "necessity"2'24 and also in a more controversial category of cases, in which the legal rule no longer claims public support. 
We have seen that if someone violates a speed limit law in order to escape from a terrorist, a criminal conviction is highly unlikely. In all probability, the driver will be held to have acted out of necessity, or to have created a "lesser evil." The same result will be reached if Jones trespasses on property in order to prevent someone's death, or if Smith steals a weapon from a third party in order to prevent bodily harm to Young.22 Of course, citizens are not permitted to decide freely and for themselves whether compliance with a rule is justified in a particular case. But in most legal systems, a citizen will have a legally sufficient excuse for violating the rule if the violation was necessary to avert a greater harm, and the excuse will exist whether or not any legal decision has previously recognized it as such. 
The other, more controversial category of legally permissible violations of law by citizens involves the old notion of desuetudo, which forbids the invocation of old, unenforced rules to ban conduct in cases in which people have come to rely on nonenforcement. 226 The idea has a powerful democratic dimension. If a rule, or a particular application of a rule, is founded on a social norm that no longer has much support, we might expect it to be enforced not at all, or only on rare occasions. The rule therefore will be a tool for harassment and not an ordinary law at all. The rare occasions of enforcement might well involve arbitrary or discriminatory factors, resulting, for instance, from a police officer's mood, or personal animus, or bias of some kind. A prosecution for fornication, brought in 1995, might well have such features. 

Consider in this regard the controversial case of Griswold v. Connecticut2,27 involving a ban on the use of contraceptives by a married couple. The ban was not enforced directly by prosecutors. No such prosecution could have received public support; it would have been an outrage. The principal function of the ban was to deter clinics from dispensing contraceptives to poor people. The problem with the ban was not that it was unsupported by old traditions but instead that it had no basis in modem convictions. Few people believed that sex within marriage was acceptable only if engaged in for purposes of procreation, and those people could not possibly have commanded a legislative majority, or even made it possible to bring many actual prosecutions against married couples. 
Instead of relying on an argument about a broad right of "privacy," the Supreme Court should have invalidated the law on the narrower ground that citizens need not comply with criminal statutes, or applications of criminal statutes, that are unenforced and that find no support in anything like common democratic conviction. A judgment of this kind would have had the advantage of incomplete theorization: it might have produced broader support for the decision among a range of people, including those who reject any "right of privacy" or who are uncertain about its foundations and limits. 
Another controversial case, Bowers v. Hardwick,"2 involving Georgia's ban on homosexual sodomy, might well be understood as a repeat of Griswold. The ban on homosexual sodomy is rarely enforced against consenting adults. Prosecutors simply do not initiate proceedings, for prevailing social norms would not permit many prosecutions of this kind. To be sure, citizens did not successfully seek repeal of the statute; but the statute's nonenforcement made political mobilization most unlikely. The simple fact of widespread nonenforcement strongly suggests that the statute was out of keeping with prevailing norms. Realistically speaking, the ban on consensual homosexual sodomy is instead a weapon with which police officers and others can harass people on invidious grounds. The existence of an unenforced law, used for purposes of harassment, is objectionable for that reason alone. We can draw a general conclusion. Citizens have engaged in legitimate rule revision (or revision of application of rules) when they violate rules that lack support in popular convictions-unless those convictions are themselves demonstrably unjust. 
Griswold and Bowers involved rules that might be thought to be legitimately disregarded. The same argument would apply to all situations in which rules or applications of otherwise valid criminal statutes have entirely fallen out of popular favor. In disregarding palpably outdated rules or palpably outdated applications of modem rules, citizens are participating in a healthy and continuous process of democratic deliberation.22 9 
It is not clear whether American law fully recognizes the citizen's right to revise rules in this way; the doctrine of desuetudo has no clear place. But the dilemmas posed by rules and rulelessness might be less severe if citizens, like officials, were permitted to depart from rules in the cases I have described. Through this route, we might well respond to Bentham's problem in a way that avoids the dangers of Bentham's solution. 
Often a legal system should make the choice between rules and rulelessness on the basis of a contextual inquiry into the aggregate level of likely errors and abuses. 230 In this sense, the choice depends not on any rule, but on a form of casuistry. I have suggested that when judges or other interpreters are perceived to be ignorant, corrupt, or biased, or in any case when they diverge in their judgments from the people who make rules, a legal system should and probably will proceed with rules.2 31 Even a poor fit, in the form of overinclusive and underinclusive rules, can be tolerated when individualized decisions would result in a similar level of inaccuracy. We might favor ruleness when there is no special reason to distrust those who make decisions. So too, individualized decisions are likely to be dispensed with when it is possible to come up with rules that fit well. 
The choice between rules and rulelessness might be seen as presenting a principal-agent problem. The legislature, as the principal, seeks to control the decisions of its agents. A problem with rules is that the agents might be able to track the wishes of the principal better or best if they are free to take account of individual circumstances. Any rule might inadequately capture the legislature's considered judgments about particular cases. The costs of rulelessness might be acceptable if the legislature does not believe that the court or other interpreter is untrustworthy, perhaps because there is a widely shared view of the relevant problems. 
On the other hand, without rules the agent might become uncontrollable. This is so especially in light of the fact that a system of factors usually allows the agent to weigh each factor as he chooses.232 The result is that a system of rules might be adopted as the best way, overall, to control the agent's discretion, at least if there is a measure of distrust of some or all agents. 
REv.(forthcoming 1996) (defending Supreme Court's casuitical approach to affirmative action as a way of refusing to foreclose options and to allow democratic debate.) 
inquiry into the benefits of rules and standards. 

Rules tend to be sensible-and to be adopted in the first place-when social consensus exists within the lawmaking body;2 33 risk-free decisions that make use of factors or standards are more probable when there is disagreement. It is not hard to obtain a ban on racial discrimination when people agree that this form of discrimination is illegitimate; it is much harder to obtain a similar ban on discrimination against the handicapped, so standards and factors are pervasive.2 34 Consider the fact that Congress often delegates discretionary power to an agency when it is unable to agree on the appropriate rule, because of social conflict, and therefore it tells the agency to act "reasonably." Examples include the areas of broadcasting regulation2 35 and occupational safety and health. 236 The costs of laying down rules are increased in the face of disagreement on their content. 
Sometimes, too, it is impossible to come up with an adequate rule in a multimember body. Often participants in a dispute begin discussion by attempting agreement on "principles" rather than concrete rules, as in diplomatic controversies over the Middle East.237 So too people may be able to agree on a set of relevant factors, or perhaps on some particular set of outcomes, without being able to agree on a rule, or on the general reasons that account for particular outcomes.238 Sometimes people will agree on general principles but disagree on particular cases. Sometimes the opposite is true. When rules do not emerge from legislatures, it may well be because it is impossible to get agreement within a heterogeneous body. Return here to the fact that legislatures that delegate broad discretion can internalize large benefits of rulelessness: economizing on information costs and on the political costs of specificity. They can simultaneously externalize the costs of rulelessness, which will then be faced by administrators. It is administrators who must compile relevant information and face the political heat of making hard and specific choices. 
It follows that we are likely to find rules when one group of interests is well-organized or otherwise powerful, and when its adversaries are not. In circumstances of this sort, the well-organized interests can press the governmental body in the direction of rules. A well-organized group is unlikely to allow itself to become at risk through rulelessness when it need not do so (unless it believes that it is even more likely to be successful with discretion-wielding bureaucrats or judges). Consider laws governing the regulation of agriculture, which are often highly specific, in part because the farmers' lobby is well-organized, while the opponents of such laws are not.23 9 
Factors or standards are more likely to be the basis for decision when opposing interests have roughly equivalent power in the lawmaking body, and when they are equally willing to take their chances with a bureaucracy or a judge.24 ° This may be so because they are both highly organized, or because they are both weak and diffuse. A possible example is the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which is quite vague,24 in part because its opponents and adversaries are both powerful. 
On the other hand, two well-organized groups might produce a rule when compromise is possible and when there are, to both groups, special risks in relying on an agency or a court. This may be the case, for example, when the regulated class needs to know what the rule is, so it can plan its affairs. Perhaps it is better to have fairly bad rules than no rules at all. When planning is made possible by clear rules, members of the regulated class may have it within their power to avoid (some of) the costs of inaccurate rules. Informed of the content of the rule, class members can adjust their conduct so as to avoid violating the rule in cases in which the rule is overinclusive. On the other hand, this avoidance may itself be an undesirable social cost. Return to the problem of site-level unreasonableness, where application of an overbroad rule forces employers to make workplace changes that produce possibly little gain, and at possibly high cost. 242 
Rules are also more likely to be unacceptable when the costs of error in particular cases are very high. The enormous danger of error can make overinclusive and underinclusive rules intolerable. It is one thing to have a flat rule that people under the age of sixteen cannot drive: the social and economic costs of mistaken denials of a license are relatively low. It is quite another thing to have a flat rule that people falling in a certain class will be put to death. It is for this reason that rule-bound decisions are unacceptable in inflicting capital punishment, 243 and to some extent in criminal sentencing generally. 2 " (But here we must believe not only that rules make for error, but also that case-by-case decisions will make for less error.) 
This point also helps to explain the dramatic difference between criminal liability, which is generally rule-bound, and criminal sentencing, which 

REGULATION (James Q. Wilson ed., 1978); Michael T. Hayes, The Semi-Sovereign PressureGroups, 40 J. PoL. 134 (1978). 

present purposes is that these are guidelines and not rules. See supra notes 36-44 and accompanying text. is generally less so. Part of the story is that specificity is needed at the liability stage, so that people can plan accordingly, and so that the discretion of the police is sharply cabined. Both interests are weaker at the sentencing stage. Planning is not so insistently at stake. Errors in degree of punishment are less objectionable than errors in subjecting an innocent person to punishment. The discretion of the sentencing judge or jury is also less prone to abuse than the discretion of the police officer, because the former, generally speaking, are less likely to decide on the basis of arbitrary or irrelevant factors. 
I have noted that rules are less acceptable in the face of sharp limits in information and experience. When information is lacking, or can be obtained only at high cost, officials will avoid rules. At the same time, rules-once they are in place-economize on information costs at the point of application. For example, there was a dramatic shift from adjudication to rulemaking in American administrative agencies in the 1960s and 1970s, partly on the theory that rules could resolve many cases at once, and limit the informational costs, biases, and errors of case-by-case judgments.2 45 But because of the informational demands imposed on those who make rules in the first instance, rules are now exceptionally difficult to promulgate, and there has been a shift in the other direction, toward decision without rules. In the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, it takes over a year and a half to prepare a rule internally; half a year more to receive the legally-required public comments; and sixteen more months to analyze the comments and issue the rules.24 6 It is not at all surprising that the result is to shift agencies away from rulemaking and toward less costly options. 47 
Rules are also less acceptable when circumstances are changing rapidly. When circumstances are changing, rules are likely to be inaccurate. Consider, for example, a congressional decision to issue a statutory standard for permissible emissions levels for coal-fired power plants. Surely any such standard will soon be out of date because of technological change. In these circumstances it may be best to enact privately adaptable rules, 2 48 to delegate decisions to institutions capable of changing them rapidly, or perhaps to allow case-by-case judgments based on relevant factors. 
When numerous decisions of the same general class must be made, the inaccurate fit of a rule becomes far more tolerable.24 9 Consider, for example, the requirement that all drivers must be over the age of sixteen, or the POLICy 555 (3d ed. 1992). 

Administration:LegalDeterminantsofBureaucraticOrganizationand Performance, 57 U. Cm. L. REv. 443 (1990). 
use of the social security grid to decide disability claims. Infuriating bureaucratic insistence on "the technicalities" may result simply because so many decisions must be made, and because individualized inquiry into whether the technicalities make sense in each case is too time-consuming. Similarly, rules can be avoided when few decisions need to be made, or when each case effectively stands on its own. 
We should conclude that the choice between rules and rulelessness cannot be made on the basis of rules. That choice is itself a function of factors. It would be obtuse to say that one or another usually makes sense, or is justified in most settings. To decide between rules and rulelessness, we need to know a great deal about the context-the likelihood of bias, the extent of current information, the location and nature of social disagreement, the stakes, the risk of over-inclusiveness, the quality of those who apply the law, the alignment or nonalignment of views between lawmakers and others, the sheer number of cases. It follows that a well-functioning legal system should be suspicious of two trends in recent writing-extravagant enthusiasm for rules2 50 and excessive focus on the possibility of achieving accurate outcomes through fine-grained encounters with particulars.25 1 
D. 
An ambitious strategy might emerge from distinguishing between two sorts of rules, or, more accurately, between rules having and lacking a certain important characteristic. 2 52 Some rules allocate initial entitlementsthese unquestionably count as rules-but at the same time maximize individual flexibility and minimize the informational burden on government, by allowing private adaptation to determine ultimate outcomes. Consider, as a defining example, background rules in the law of contract, which can be adapted by the parties as they choose.25 3 , A background rule states a presumption: it applies if the parties do not provide otherwise, but the parties are freely entitled to alter it if they choose. 
Other examples pervade the legal system. The rules of the road are unalterable in the sense that one cannot make green mean red or vice-versa, or drive on the wrong side; but the rules of the road allow large room for private judgment and thus differ from specific commands. By creating conventions, these rules help facilitate private conduct and permit people to

14861, distinguishing between "laws" and "commands." This is a highly illuminating but also confused discussion; I have drawn on some of Hayek's ideas but tried to reduce the level of confusion. 
in Incomplete Contracts:An Economic Theory ofDefault Rules, 99 YALE L.J. 87 (1989). operate under mutually beneficial arrangements.25 4 Perhaps the most basic example can be found in common law rules allocating property rights and thus creating private property, or rules governing entry into agreements. In the same vein, a promising effort to allow private adaptation in current health and safety policy involves taxes imposed on polluting sources2. 5 The rules embodied in such taxes are privately adaptable in the sense that people subject to the tax can alter their conduct so as to eliminate the tax or to reduce it; it is for them to decide just how to respond. In the same vein it has been suggested that if stabilizing population is the goal, rigid limits on family size may be inferior, as a policy tool, to more flexible, incentivebased strategies, such as greater education and employment for women.2 56 All of these various provisions might be described as privately adaptable rules. 
By contrast, some laws do not merely allocate entitlements, but also minimize private flexibility by mandating particular end-states or outcomes. Consider price controls, or specified technology for new cars, or flat bans on carcinogens in the workplace. Even if these rules have some flexibility at the margin, they allow little scope for private adaptation. Rules that specify end-states are common in modem regulation, in the form of "command and control" regulation that says exactly what people must do and how they must do it.257 
The line between privately adaptable rules and commands is one of degree rather than one of kind. What I am describing is a characteristic present to a greater or lesser degree in some rules, not a crisply defined category of rules. Even command-and-control regulation allows a degree of private adaptation, in the sense that people are permitted to go out of business or to change their line of work so as to escape regulation entirely. Notably, all rules, including the most adaptable rules, allocate entitlements. The allocation may well have an effect on people's preferences, since people tend to prefer things that have been initially allocated to them;258 it might also affect distributions and hence end-states as well.2 59 
Indeed, it is insufficiently appreciated that government cannot avoid the task of allocating entitlements and of doing so through rules. Laissezfaire is a chimera; what is familiarly described as laissez-faire is actually a particular set of legal rules. Our rights, as we live them, do not come from 
69111 (1975); ALLEN V. KNEEE, EcoNoMcs AND Tm ENVIRONMENT 260-63 (1977). 
allocation of the entitlement will not affect outcomes. See Cass R. Sunstein, Endogenous Preferences, EnvironmentalLaw, 22 J. LEGAL STUD. 217, 223-24 (1993). nature. They depend on law.2 6 ° The rules of private property and freedom of contract are rules, and they are legal in character. What I want to emphasize here is that these rules are distinctive in the sense that they allocate initial entitlements, allow private adaptation, and do not specify end-states. 
The claim on behalf of privately adaptable rules is not that laissez-faire is a possibility for law. It is instead that law can choose rules with certain characteristics-rules that will reduce the risks of rules, by allowing private adaptation and by harnessing market and private forces in such a way as to minimize the ex ante informational and political burden imposed on government. A large part of the ultimate project of minimizing the costs of rigid rules is to favor rules that specify and allocate initial entitlements, and to disfavor rules that specify outcomes. In some cases, of course, private adaptation should not be allowed, because of effects on third parties, costs of administration and monitoring, lack of information, collective action problems, or other factors. 61 
A key feature of privately adaptable rules is their association with free alienability of rights. Ownership rights are of course freely alienable, and in this way they respond well to the fact that owners and prospective purchasers know how valuable the relevant rights are to them. The informational burden on government is therefore minimized. The surrounding rules do not operate as personal orders. To be sure, privately adaptable rules are coercive. The law of property is itself coercive insofar as it prevents nonowners from claiming what they would otherwise claim and doing what they would otherwise do.262 The virtue of privately adaptable rules is not that they are not coercive and not that they are "natural"; it is that they reduce the costs of rule-making and harness private information and preferences 6 3 in the service of outcomes that are themselves not identified ex ante. 
People who favor privately adaptable rules and who distrust rules that specify end-states are often known as critics of the modem regulatory state. 64 The distinction between the two sorts of rules might easily be harnessed in the service of an argument for private property, freedom of contract, simple rules of tort law, and relatively little else. The same insights might, however, be used on behalf of reform strategies that take the modem CoLEMAN, RISKS AND WRONGS 60-62 (1992). This was an important theme in the New Deal era. For general discussion, see CASS R. SuNsTErN, THE PARTIAL CoNsnrrtrioN 40-67 (1993). Some important qualifications emerge from ROBERT C. ELLICKSON, ORDER WrrHotn' LAW 156-66 (1991).

Although Hayek would allow the state to go well beyond the common law, he is sharply critical of the tendencies of post-1945 regulators. state as an important social good. Many current regulatory rules are dysfunctional not because they promote the goals of the modem regulatory state, but because they unnecessarily specify end-states.2 6 5 In so doing, they produce both injustice and inefficiency, in the form of overinclusiveness and underinclusiveness, replicating all of the problems typically associated with a refusal to make inquiries at the point of application. 
A prominent example of this kind of rule is command-and-control regulation, pervasive in the law of environmental protection; this form of regulation has produced significant problems because of the pathologies of rules.26 6 It makes no sense to say that all industries must adopt the same control technology, regardless of the costs and benefits of adoption in the particular case.267 Command-and-control should generally be replaced by more flexible, incentive-based strategies, which invoke privately adaptable rules. Such strategies could save a great deal of resources by reducing legal rigidity. Liberty would be promoted as well. Instead of saying what specific technologies companies must use, a privately adaptable law might impose pollution taxes or fees, and then allow private judgments about the best means of achieving social goals. The government might also allow companies to buy and sell pollution licenses, a system that would create good incentives for pollution reduction without imposing on government the significant informational burden of specifying means of pollution reduction. The familiar economic argument for incentives is a key part of the argument for privately adaptable rules.26 8 
Or consider the area of telecommunications, an area that has for too long been burdened by unduly rigid rules. For much of its history, the Federal Communications Commission has been faced with the task of deciding how to allocate licenses.2 69 In making this decision, it has alternated between rules and factors. In using factors, the FCC has referred to local ownership, minority ownership, participation by owners in public affairs, broadcast experience, the adequacy of technical facilities, the background and qualifications of staff, the character of owners, and more. 270 The problems with both rules and factors are entirely predictable-inaccu265. This is a large theme in recent works on regulation. See, e.g., Ackerman & Stewart, supra note 217; CASS R.

racy through excessive rigidity on the one hand, and discretionary, ad hoc, costly, potentially abusive judgments on the other. 7 1 
What alternatives are possible? In a famous early article, Ronald Coase argued that the government should allocate broadcasting licenses through a system of privately adaptable rules17 2 -based on property rights and market transfers, as property law does (for example) for ownership of newspapers and automobiles. In the recent past the FCC has experimented with auctions, and the results have been outstanding.27 3 There is an obvious objection to Coase's proposal. Perhaps broadcasting licenses should not be regarded as ordinary property; perhaps the criterion of private willingness to pay is an inadequate basis for awarding licenses. This objection contains an important point. 274 Broadcasting may promote a range of "nonmarket" values, captured in the aspiration to promote education, attention to public affairs, diversity of view, and high-quality programming. 75 But this objection is not a justification for departing from privately adaptable rules in favor of command-and-control regulation. Any non-market values might be promoted by more flexible means. Thus the rules for auctions might be designed so as to ensure auction credits for those applicants who promise to promote nonmarket values.2 76 This example shows that privately adaptable rules might well be used not to oppose regulatory goals, but instead to harness market forces in the interest of those very goals.2 77 
E. 
Sometimes both rules and factors are intolerable; sometimes market forces cannot or should not be harnessed. Having eliminated both rules and factors, the law might use a lottery instead as a method of allocating costs and benefits.2 78 (Of course the decision to hold a lottery is supported by a rule.) This is a possible solution to the problems posed by a military draft, where rule-bound judgments seem too crude, and where rule-free judgments are too obviously subject to discrimination and caprice. Lotteries are used

symbolic, educative, or expressive problems of (for example) a "discrimination tax" or a "license to discriminate."

36122 (1989). in many other areas as well.27 9 Of course lotteries have an arbitrariness of their own, and for this reason, they may be an inferior approach. 8 0 
Alternatively, the legal system, having found both rules and rulelessness inadequate, might abolish the relevant institution or practice itself. (The abolition must of course be accomplished by rule.) Hence the narrowest and probably the best argument for abolition of the death penalty takes the following form. Rules are unacceptable because they eliminate the possibility of adaptation of criminal sentencing to individual circumstances.2 8 1 Privately adaptable rules would make little sense in the context of criminal punishment, with the possible and controversial exception of plea bargaining. Rule-bound death sentences are excessively impersonal. But rule-free systems, including those based on factors, are unacceptable too, because they allow excessive discretion and create a risk that irrelevant or illegitimate considerations will enter the decision to impose capital punishment. When judgments are to be made about who is to live and who is to die, a high degree of accuracy is necessary, and errors based on confusion, variable judgments, bias, or venality are intolerable. The problem is that human institutions cannot devise a system for making capital decisions in a way that sufficiently diminishes the risk of error. Rule-bound systems create too many errors; so too with systems based on factors. 
The strongest argument against the death penalty is not that the penalty of death is too brutal, but that it cannot be administered in a sufficiently accurate way. Suppose it could be shown that through individualized consideration in the form of factors, the rate of error is high, at least in the sense that irrelevant or invidious factors play a large role in the ultimate decision of life or death. Suppose that rules are the only way to eliminate the role of such factors, but that rules are objectionable in their own way, because they do not allow consideration of possible mitigating factors. Perhaps evidence to this effect would not be sufficient to convince skeptics that the death penalty is unacceptable. But if it is possible to persuade a sufficiently broad range of people of this conclusion, the sources of the argument lie in evidence of this sort. 
CONCLUSION 
A system committed to the rule of law is committed to limiting official discretion, but it is not committed to the unrealistic goal of making every decision according to judgments fully specified in advance. Nonetheless, rules are an admirable device for obtaining agreement on the content of law, and also for reducing discretion at the point of application. Often people 
possible combinations might be imagined. 
and Stevens, JJ.). can agree on rules when they disagree about abstract and theoretical issues; they can agree that rules are binding, that rules are good, and that rules have a certain identifiable meaning. Frequently a lawmaker adopts rules because rules narrow or even eliminate the range of disagreement and uncertainty faced by people attempting to follow or to interpret the law. This step has enormous virtues in terms of promoting predictability and planning and reducing both costs and risks of official abuse. 
Rules are sometimes thought to be associated with merely formal equality; but the association is misconceived. Hayekian understandings of the rule of law-identifying rules with free markets-introduce into that notion further ideas that should be distinguished and that require an independent defense. 
Rule-skeptics say that rules are not what they appear to be. In their view, full ex ante specification of outcomes is a chimera. The need for interpretation during encounters with concrete cases means that ex post assessments of some sort are an inescapable part of law. Casuistry is a large part of rule-interpretation. There is some important truth in this claim. Almost any judgment about meaning will partake of ex post substantive ideas of a sort. It is almost inevitable that some case will arise that will confound the attempt to use rules to specify all outcomes in advance. What I have called "the problem of the single exception" is common in ruleinterpretation. 
These claims are chastening. But they should not be read for more than they are worth. Certainly they do not defeat the project of those who are enthusiastic about rules. Usually the question of meaning is easy. Often ex ante specification is possible for most cases, where shared understandings permit rule-following. 
Rules have many goals, but as they operate in law, they are often simple summaries of good decisions in individual cases. In carrying out this task, they reduce costs, ease choice, limit the errors encountered in particular decisions, produce coordination, and make it unnecessary to debate issues of value and fact every time someone does something having social consequences. Because of their ex ante character, rules will usually be overinclusive and underinclusive with reference to the arguments that justify them. They will often be outrun by changing circumstances. Usually the crudeness of rules is tolerable, and most of the resulting inefficiency and injustice can be controlled through means short of abandoning rules. But sometimes the crudeness of rules counts decisively against them. 
Many of the most difficult issues in law involve the choice between rules and rulelessness in cases in which both seem unacceptable-rules, because of their crudeness and their insensitivity to particulars that confound them; rulelessness, because of the likelihood of arbitrariness and discrimination in application. The Benthamite strategy calls for ex ante rules for the public and ex post case-by-case particularism for judges. I have questioned this strategy on both economic and democratic grounds, but sometimes flexible, contextual interpretation of rules, adapting the general to the particular, can bring about something like the best of both worlds. 
More generally, privately adaptable rules are a promising effort to minimize the problems of excessive generality, by opting for rules that allow private adjustment, harness private ordering, and reduce the informational costs imposed on government. Some people who favor such rules intend their arguments to be a challenge to regulation and a basis for approval of unrestricted (though rule-governed) "free" markets."' 2 But privately adaptable rules may enjoy an important rebirth in the context of government regulation-in the creation of rules that are designed to accomplish regulatory goals, but that do so by specifying initial entitlements rather than final outcomes, and that harness market forces in the interest of socially chosen ends. 
I have also suggested that legitimate rule revisions are pervasive, and that the choice between rules and rulelessness might well be based on a highly pragmatic, contextualized inquiry into the costs of the two approaches in the area at hand. Thus understood, the choice would itself be based on the practice of casuistry, in which judgments for or against rules emerge not from rules, but from careful assessments of particular circumstances. I have urged that casuistry may well be given democratic foundations insofar as it places a premium on rights to participate and to receive a response.2 83 Casuistry is hardly all there is to a well-functioning legal system, and it has important limitations. But if what I have argued here is correct, a form of casuistry plays an important role in the interpretation of rules themselves, and it occupies a distinguished and prominent place even in a legal system committed to rule-bound justice and the rule of law.

INTRODUCTION 
Probably the most important development in administrative law in the 1980s came not from federal courts, nor even from Congress, but from Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. In two executive orders, President Reagan asserted vigorous centralized control over the regulatory process. The first such order, Executive Order 12291, laid out a set of substantive principles, most notably cost-benefit analysis, and said that these principles would be binding on executive agencies to the extent permitted by law.' This Order also contained an important procedural provision. It required all major regulations to be accompanied by a "regulatory impact analysis," which would be submitted for review and approval to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs ("OIRA"), an institution within the Office of Management and Budget ("OMB"). 2 The order amounted to an effort to promote centralized OMB control of the regulatory process, to be conducted in accordance with presidential policies favoring deregulation and close attention to cost. 
President Reagan's second relevant executive order, Executive Order 12498, went a step further. It required each agency to submit an "annual regulatory plan," consisting of proposed actions for the next year, that was to be included in a publicly available annual document, the Regulatory Program of the United States.3 Under this order, all agencies were required to submit their proposals to OIRA for review and approval.4 New initiatives not included in the annual plan were permitted only under a narrow set of circumstances.5 The Order placed OIRA in the center of regulatory planning. 
The Reagan initiatives were defended with several theoretical and empirical arguments. National bureaucracies are numerous, even chaotic, and regulations that are nominally independent of one another may produce considerable inconsistency in practice. Some degree of presidential review of the regulatory process is probably necessary to promote political accountability and to centralize and coordinate the regulatory process. These 1 Exec Order No 12291 § 2, 3 CFR 128 (1981), reprinted in 5 USC § 601 note (1988). 2 Id § 3 at 128-30. ' Exec Order No 12498, 3 CFR 323 (1985), reprinted in 5 USC § 601 note (1988). 4 Id at 324. 6 Id at 324-35. are important goals, particularly in light of the need for sensible priority setting in a nation that devotes extraordinary resources to some minor problems and low levels of funding to some major problems.' 
In addition, the cost of regulation-perhaps as high as $400 billion annually,7 with up to $124 billion spent on environmental regulation alone--is too high for the benefits received.9 We could obtain the same level of benefits far more cheaply. Perhaps centralized presidential control could diminish some of the characteristic pathologies of modern regulation-myopia, interestgroup pressure, draconian responses to sensationalist anecdotes, poor priority setting, and simple confusion. In theory, OMB control promised to bring about not only greater political accountability, but also more in the way of technocratic competence, thus returning to the original New Deal goal of combining democratic and technocratic virtues. ° Many people thought that the new system of OMB oversight was admirably well suited to overcoming the difficulties in the regulatory process." 
Despite these points, the Reagan orders were extremely controversial. The criticisms fell into four basic categories: counterproductive transfer of authority from regulatory agencies to OMB. This transfer of authority, it was said, disregarded the cgoavmepathraetiPvereesixdpeenrttisneo opfotwheeragtoenbcriiensganabdovuitolaanteydstuhcehlatrwan,swfehric.h2 The transfer was especially controversial in light of the perception that OMB would be unduly biased against regulation. 3 oversight was too secretive. In their view, the lack of public visibility disguised a new system in which well-organized private groups-particularly regulated industries-were allowed to dictate national policy.'4 Especially during the period of Vice President Quayle's Council on Competitiveness, some feared that regulatory policy was being made by a "shadow government" operating at the behest of private factions and accountable, in practice, to no one with an adequate claim to public legitima15 cy. 
dwarfed OMB's limited resources and resulted in excessive delay. The few officials at OIRA lacked the time and capacities to engage in truly expert assessment of regulation and its complex costs and benefits. Because OMB was unable effectively to assess the wide range of regulations submitted to it, its principal function was to slow things down. The result was to deprive the public of desirable or necessary regulations and, on occasion, to violate the law. 6 
reflected in the Reagan orders. In their view, cost-benefit analysis was too partisan a standard to capture the full array of considerations properly invoked by regulatory agencies. In practice and perhaps in principle, critics urged, the idea of cost-benefit analysis was a device not for producing the right kind and amount of regulation, but for diminishing the role of regulation even when it was beneficial. This substantive agenda, it was said, violated "' See Erik D. Olson, The QuietShift ofPower: Office ofManagement& BudgetSupervi. sion of EnvironmentalProtectionAgency Rulemaking UnderExecutive Order12,291, 4 Va J Nat Resources L 1, 31-35 (1984).

concluded that OMB delayed EPA regulations that were subject to statutory deadlines for ninety-one days on average. EnvironmentalDefense Fund v Thomas, 627 F Supp 566, 571 (D DC 1986). Although § 8(a)( review regulations "for which consideration or reconsideration under the terms of this Order would conflict with deadlines imposed by statute or by judicial order," the court concluded that this section of the Order was "simply ignored." Id at 570-71. 
An article from the same time period asserts that the average time for all regulatory reviews by OMB was sixteen days. DeMuth and Ginsburg, 99 Harv L Rev at 1088 (cited in note 11). For an illuminating discussion of agency-OIRA interactions, see E. Donald Elliott, TQM-ing OMB: Or Why RegulatoryReview UnderExecutive Order 12,291 Works Poorly and What President Clinton Should Do About It, 57 L & Contemp Probs 167 (1994). the President's duty under the Take Care Clause and also was unjustified in light of the need for regulation in many areas of modern life.' 
In light of the extraordinary importance of OMB oversight to so much of American government, many observers were extremely curious to see how President Clinton would reform the Reagan initiatives. The process of reform was surprisingly slow. Whereas President Reagan had issued the first of the two executive orders within one week of assuming office, President Clinton did not respond for many months. On September 30, 1993, however, President Clinton issued his long-awaited repeal and replacement of Executive Orders 12291 and 12498.18 
President Clinton's Order, Executive Order 12866, is a dramatic and in many ways quite surprising step. First and in some ways foremost, it maintains the basic process inaugurated by President Reagan, including the essential procedural provision of Executive Order 12291: the requirement that major regulations be submitted to OMB for general review and oversight.'9 It also includes the essential procedural provision of Executive Order 12498: the requirement that agencies submit an annual regulatory plan, compiled in conjunction with OMB." 
At least equally important, Executive Order 12866 also maintains much of the substantive focus of the Reagan orders, including the emphasis on cost-benefit analysis as the basic foundation of decision.2' President Clinton thus rejected the view that an assessment of costs and benefits is an unhelpful or unduly sectarian conception of the basis of regulation. 
At the same time, the Clinton Order marks a number of important substantive and procedural shifts. Executive Order 12866 includes a set of innovations specifically designed to overcome the problems faced in the Reagan and Bush administrations. In particular, it addresses unnecessary conflicts between agencies and OMB, and the appearance (or perhaps the reality) of factional influence over the review processY It also places the Vice President squarely in charge of the regulatory processY It reduces the number of rules that OMB will review, perhaps by as much as one-half. It seeks to overcome the "ossification" of rule making, in part by encouraging negotiated rule making.' 
The Order also includes a new, complex, and somewhat unruly set of substantive principles to govern agency decisions. Some of these principles are an outgrowth of the commitment to "reinventing government" in the service of more flexible management.' Some of them qualify the commitment to cost-benefit analysis, though in ambiguous ways. Some of them point in the direction of comparative risk assessment." Apart from their merits as policy reforms, some of these innovations are of uncertain legality. 
This Article evaluates Executive Order 12866 as part of President Clinton's program for "reinventing government." We do this in an effort to help point the way toward procedural and substantive reforms that might increase coordination and rationality in federal regulation, and in this way diminish currently excessive costs, while at the same time promoting the democratic character of regulatory processes through methods that will take advantage of appropriately informed public judgments about risk. 
To introduce some of our themes in advance: The modern regulatory state delivers insufficient benefits at unnecessarily high costs. A range of imaginable improvements could decrease = See text accompanying notes 81-87. 
Rulemaking, 3 CFR 776 ( 
' This is the major theme of David Osborne and Ted Gaebler, Reinventing Government:How the EntrepreneurialSpiritis Transformingthe PublicSector (Addison-Wesley, 1991), which has obviously had an enormous influence on the Clinton administration.

' See text accompanying notes 155-59. the costs of regulation and thus reduce prices, increase employment, and promote international competitiveness. Through such steps, reduced costs could also reduce poverty and thus risks to life and health." Through similar steps, reforms could reallocate regulatory resources to places where they will do the most good. In this way, regulatory programs could deliver greater protection of safety and health and, in the process, save many lives. 
The modem regulatory state should also be more democratic. Currently, regulation is far too inaccessible to public control. Instead, it is enshrouded in technocratic complexities not subject to public debate, affected by misleading, sensationalist anecdotes, or, even worse, subject to the influence of well-organized private groups with personal stakes in the outcome. A range of improvements could make the democratic process work better. The key task for those interested in regulatory performance is to find ways of simultaneously promoting economic and democratic goals.' 
We offer a range of proposals designed to accomplish this task. A special goal is to incorporate public judgments about risk so long as they are appropriately informed and reasonable, even when those judgments diverge from expert understandings. We spend considerable space on this complex subject, contending that public judgments often reflect a distinctive kind of rationality, one that rejects some conventional forms of cost-benefit balancing. Executive Order 12866 might well be administered in a way that takes advantage of this insight. In short, we offer the following recommendations: 
of rationalizing regulatory policy by ensuring good priority setting, comparison of risks in terms of seriousness, and careful attention to the most important problems. To this end, it should issue guidelines and recommendations for the best use of limited

'8 It is too soon for any real conclusions about the actual implementation ofExecutive Order 12866. We note, however, that the first major report on the Order was concerned almost exclusively with procedural issues of internal governmental management; it said nothing about whether the Order was actually making for better or worse regulation. See Office of Management and Budget, Report on Executive Order No 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, 59 Fed Reg 24276 (1994). There appears to be a risk that OIRA will be unduly concerned with procedural issues and fail to focus on what is most important, the substance of regulation. public and private resources, together with information about the concrete, actual consequences of current efforts and about ways of improving them.'

review" in which it demonstrates in concrete terms how, and at what cost, regulation under its supervision has promoted particular social goals. To this end, OIRA should publicize its shortterm and long-term goals for regulation in relatively concrete terms and show whether and how the government has made progress in meeting those goals. It should do this as part of a general effort to encourage public trust and public understanding of regulatory outcomes and choices. It should also attempt to promote, to the extent feasible, citizen participation in the process of setting regulatory priorities. 
aggregate costs and benefits, but also in terms that reflect democratic judgments about qualitative differences among qualitatively different risks. By qualitative differences, we mean to include an understanding of whether a risk is voluntarily incurred, especially dreaded, equitably distributed, potentially irreversible or catastrophic, faced by future generations, or incurred by discrete groups within the population. To incorporate an understanding of these factors, OIRA and relevant agencies might experiment with three approaches: (a) develop formulas that assign numbers to, and thus incorporate, qualitative differences; (b) offer a two-stage analytic process, the first based on conventional cost-benefit balancing, the second introducing qualitative differences in order to produce a final judgment; and (c) use different forms of citizen participation so as to build into the regulatory process an understanding of informed public judg 
Many proposals in Congress suggest this approach by requiring comparative risk assessment. See the Johnston Amendment, S 171 § 123, 103d Cong, 1st Sess (May 4, 1993), in 139 Cong Rec S5362 (May 4, 1993).

Informational remedies should be based on a careful understanding of how people process information and develop trust, a key ingredient of successful risk communication.

Moreover, the use of incentives should be limited to certain specific circumstances that we identify. 
interest in improving health and safety regulation. Without a firm signal from the highest levels of government, OIRA is unlikely to be able to accomplish much of its mission, and the potential advantages of centralized control will be lost. 
This Article is organized into five parts. Part I describes the history of presidential oversight of the regulatory process, showing that such oversight has been a steady development in the twentieth century and that it can now be said to be permanent, or at least as permanent as any procedural innovation not required by the Constitution itself. Part H deals with institutional issues, in particular with those procedures designed to bring about greater openness and visibility. This self-conscious effort at democratization is one of the most distinctive features of Executive Order 12866. Part II also discusses the fact that the Order contains an apparent presidential (and vice-presidential) veto on agency regulations-a bold step that goes well beyond anything that Presidents Reagan or Bush endorsed, at least publicly. It concludes with a discussion of the Order's partial and unprecedented inclusion of the independent regulatory commissions. 
Parts III, IV, and V are the heart of the Article. Part III turns to substance and, in particular, to the question of regulatory ends. It focuses on cost-benefit analysis, comparative risk assessment, and the problem of regulatory rationality in general. There is good reason for enthusiasm about some basic goals and possibilities of these technologies-to increase sensible priority setting, to limit the unnecessarily high costs of regulation, and to make sure that government controls actually improve people's lives. But it is important to ensure a form of these analytic techSee Part IV.F. niques that is attuned to some of the complexities of social valuation of different risks in different contexts of social life. 
Part IV offers a number of suggestions on this score. It tries to make sense of the evident ambivalence in Executive Order 12866 toward cost-benefit analysis. We suggest that there are conceptions of rationality that resist the effort to align diverse social goods along a single metric, and that cost-benefit analysis disregards what we call the expressive dimension of regulation. Part IV also urges possible modifications to conventional costbenefit analysis, designed specifically to make a place for adequately informed and rational public judgments about risks. 
Part V discusses the question of regulatory means. Its principal topic is the conspicuous effort in Executive Order 12866 to go beyond command-and-control regulation in the interest of providing less costly means for achieving regulatory goals. Here we emphasize an unmistakable trend in federal regulation: information disclosure as a remedy for risk. We also deal with the replacement of command-and-control approaches with economic incentives. We discuss the ways in which new strategies should take account of ordinary understandings of risk and also attempt to build public trust. Through this discussion of means, as through the earlier discussion of ends, we suggest reforms that will simultaneously promote economic and democratic goals. 
I. BACKGROUND: A NEW AND PROBABLY PERMANENT FEATURE 
OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT 
Almost since the birth of the modern administrative agency, American presidents have struggled to assert more centralized control over the regulatory state. Indeed, a recent study asserts that "the history of the presidency in the twentieth century has been the history of presidents' attempts to gain control of the sprawling federal bureaucracy."3' Typically, these attempts have generated sharp congressional resistance. 
The first step in this direction can probably be traced to President Theodore Roosevelt's creation, in 1903, of a commission designed to study the scientific work done by government agencies in order to recommend more efficient coordination. The results presaged those of similar reform efforts to follow.

Roosevelt then created a second commission, the Keep Commission, to study a broader array of administrative reforms. In some ways a precursor of Vice President Gore's recent National Performance Review, the Keep Commission found that many civil servants were underemployed and resistant to new technologies, such as typewriters and adding machines. It also concluded that the system of supply acquisition was hopelessly chaotic. 3 The Keep Commission forwarded eleven formal reform proposals to Congress. When it did so, the century's first major battle between Congress and the White House over control of administration was joined. Congress not only declined to act on any of the proposals, but also expressed outrage at the Executive's effort to seize "an authority previously the exclusive and unchallenged domain of Congress."' In addition, Congress prohibited the use of government funds for such commissions in the future and even refused to appropriate funds to publish the Keep Commission's report.35 
At Congress's invitation, President Taft attempted to centralize and coordinate the budgetary process. Although Congress rejected Taft's particular proposals, by 1921 Congress granted the President effective oversight control of agency fiscal requests by enacting the Budget and Accounting Act.38 This was an extraordinary development, in many ways a precursor of current efforts to centralize the regulatory process. For the first time, the President would be given statutory authority to submit an annual budget to Congress. Wilson's wartime presidency aggressively set into motion the vision of a more managerial presidency.37 
In the period after the war, the ideas of consolidation and efficiency-motivated reorganization swept the business community. Congress eventually followed suit in 1932 with the Government Reorganization Act,38 which granted the President unilateral authority, subject to legislative veto,39 to reorganize the administrative branch. Franklin Roosevelt's Brownlow Commission revived Wilson's famous distinction between policy and administration;' the Commission saw "policy" as the joint domain of the President and Congress, whereas "administration," it asserted, must be under the direct and exclusive command of the President. Despite an initial congressional outcry, most of the Committee's proposals were enacted.4 A key reform, with lasting consequences, was the creation of the Executive Office of the President.' 
In 1949, the Hoover Commission produced yet another effort to create a more coordinated and managerial presidency. It issued 277 specific proposals for reorganizing and consolidating agencies. More than half of these were adopted via statute or executive order, with the purpose of creating a "clear line of command from the top to the bottom, and a return line of responsibility and accountability from the bottom to the top."43 
The most direct precursor to the current structure of executive oversight of regulation was the Nixon Administration's system of "Quality of Life" reviews. Nixon's response to the expanding administrative bureaucracy was to create a "counter-bureaucracy" in the White House. He doubled the executive office staff, created the modern OMB, and established the Domestic Council (chaired by a top aide, John Ehrlichman). The Council met with representatives of different departments having jurisdiction over a problem and tried to develop coordinated policy positions for presidential approval.' In the "Quality of Life" review process, agencies were required to submit significant rules to OMB in advance of publication in the Federal Register. OMB's principal duty was to circulate the agency draft to other agencies for review and comment. Although the process was intended to apply ' Act of June 30, 1932, §§ 401-08, Pub L No 72-212, 47 Stat 382, 413-15, codified at 5 USC §§ 124-31 (Supp 1932).

President Ford continued the interagency review process and added to it a process designed to control the effects of regulation on inflation. Most important, the Council on Wage and Price Stability ("CWPS") reviewed regulations to assess these effects. In addition,- OMB promulgated a circular to agencies arguing that the inflationary impact of a proposed rule could best be assessed through a quantitative cost-benefit comparison." The Council's role was principally technical, consultative, and advisory. It was understood that the relevant agency might well persist in the face of CWPS disagreement. Despite often antagonistic relationships between the agencies and CWPS, many observers believed that CWPS enhanced both public participation and the agencies' analytical capabilities.' Congress ultimately enacted a statute allowing CWPS to participate in rule making and to explore adverse effects on inflation.48 
President Carter,built on the Ford precedent through a successor to CWPS, the Regulatory Analysis Review Group ("RARG"). RARG consisted of representatives from major agencies, OMB, CWPS, and the Council of Economic Advisors. The purpose of this fifteen-agency group was to conduct interagency review of cost-effectiveness analyses, which were required of "significant" rules from relevant agencies. Notably, the Executive Order establishing the RARG review process did not require costbenefit analysis.49 In fact RARG reviewed relatively few rules, though the President did resolve a few highly controversial issues. 
dialogue, coordination, and analytical precision, as well as to reduce regulatory costs. But a decisive step came within a week of President Reagan's inauguration, with the formal creation of a mechanism for OMB review of major regulations. The most important of the new innovations, contained in Executive Order 12291, were (1) a set of substantive principles for all agencies to follow, "to the extent permitted by law," including a commitment to cost-benefit analysis; ( Impact Analysis, including a cost-benefit analysis, accompany all "major" rules; and (3) a formal mechanism for OMB oversight, with a general understanding that OMB had some (undefined) substantive control. President Reagan considered subjecting the independent agencies to the new Order, but ultimately declined to do so, partly because of concerns about legal authority, but mostly because of fears of an adverse congressional reaction.50 The independent agencies were asked voluntarily to comply with Executive Order 12291, but not one of them formally acknowledged their willingness to do so. 
Executive Order 12291 proved extremely controversial. Nonetheless, President Reagan expanded on the basic idea four years later with Executive Order 12498. As noted above, that Order established a requirement that agencies submit "annual regulatory plans" to OMB for review.5 The result is an annual publication, the Regulatory Program of the United States, which contains a discussion of all proposed actions that might be either costly or controversial. Executive Order 12498 served to increase the authority of agency heads over their staffs by exposing proposals to top-level review at an early stage. But it also increased the authority of OMB by allowing OMB supervision over basic plans and by making it hard for agencies to proceed without OMB preclearance. 
The Bush Administration continued the Reagan procedures. Its principal innovation was the Council on Competitiveness, chaired by the Vice President. The Council engaged in occasional review of agency rules, operating as a kind of supervisor of OMB itself. It also set out a number of principles and proposals for regulatory reform." 
President Clinton's Executive Order 12866 is the latest step in this process; we will investigate it shortly. Our current point is more general. From the recent evidence, it seems clear that presidential oversight of the regulatory process, though relatively new, has become a permanent part of the institutional design of American government. This new institutional arrangement has occurred for reasons parallel to the development of a centralized 'o Peter M. Shane and Harold M. Bruff The Law of PresidentialPower 358-60 (Carolina Academic, 1988).

Any president is likely to seek assurance that an unwieldy federal bureaucracy conforms its actions to his or her basic principles. Any president is likely to be concerned about excessive public and private costs. And any president is likely to want to be able to coordinate agency activity so as to ensure consistency and coherence and to guard against the imposition of conflicting duties on people who must comply with the law. The result of these forces is that a centralizing and rationalizing body, housed within OMB and devoted to regulation, has emerged as an enduring, major, but insufficiently appreciated part of the national government. 
Executive Order 12866 makes three major institutional changes from the Reagan-Bush procedures. It imposes new disclosure requirements. It attempts to sort out the allocation of authority among agencies, the White House, and OIRA. Finally, it includes the independent agencies within some aspects of presidential oversight. 
As we have said, there are strong reasons for creating and maintaining an executive office entrusted with the job of coordinating modern regulation, promoting sensible priority setting, and ensuring conformity with the President's basic mission.53 In view of the wide array of regulatory programs administered by modern government, the absence of such an office would probably guarantee duplication, parochial perspectives, and inefficiency. A number of separate agencies and programs deal with environmental and other risks, and it is therefore important to share information, to reduce inconsistency, and to devote scarce resources to places where they will do the most good. 
The past process of OIRA review has been imperfectly equipped to carry out these tasks. Too often OIRA has become involved at very late stages, operating as a kind of last-minute barrier to action at a point when cooperation and trust are nearly impossible." Too often relations between OIRA and the agencies have been adversarial, with considerable distrust and even a ' See Carnegie Commission, Risk and the Environment (cited in note 6); Breyer, Breaking the Vicious Circleat 61-68 (cited in note 6). 
4 See Elliott, 57 L & Contemp Probs at 171-74 (cited in note 16). degree of "guerilla warfare."55 What is needed instead is a definition of shared goals and objectives, accompanied by good and continuous working relations, clear jurisdictional authority, and mutual investment in the basic goals of improving regulatory performance according to agreed-upon criteria. 
Executive Order 12866 is designed in part to achieve these goals, though some of the evidence for this conclusion lies outside the four corners of the document. The Order establishes the agencies as the principal decision makers, and in this way it insists, more than its predecessors, on agency autonomy." In general, the process appears to involve a government-wide system of priority setting, rather than one concentrated in OMB. Thus the Order contemplates an annual agency policy meeting to set priorities and coordinate activities. 7 The Order also requires each agency head to designate a Regulatory Policy Officer, who is to be involved "at each stage of the regulatory process."8 
Following this provision, the Clinton Administration has created a set of Regulatory Policy Officers within each agency.59 These officers are specifically charged with improving the regulatory process by ensuring conformity with Executive Order 12866. The officers work with a new Regulatory Working Group created by the Order, chaired by the OIRA Administrator, and attended by specially appointed White House Regulatory Policy Advisors.60 The purpose of this system is to promote early interaction and cooperation by coordinating agency and OIRA behavior, and also to ensure exchange of information among agencies, with a particular eye toward sensible treatment of problems that cut across agencies.6 In a similar attempt to limit conflicts and to reduce unnecessary layers of bureaucratic oversight, Executive Order 12866 also attempts to reduce the number of rules to be reviewed by OIRA, cutting the number in half from previous years. 2 The Order seeks to promote democratization as well by Id at 171.

' See id. requiring the OIRA Administrator to meet with members of the public and to convene conferences to this end.' 
It is impossible to tell at this stage whether these institutional innovations will accomplish a great deal. Much of the evidence will come from the regulations that eventually emerge. If cooperation is an end in itself, it is a limited one, and the success of the new process will be measured principally by substance-what emerges from it. Two early reasons for concern are the apparent absence of clear OIRA focus on regulatory consequences, and the apparent failure to develop a close sense of regulatory priorities through general publicity about the nature of various risks and the costs of eliminating them.Y It would be highly desirable for OIRA to attempt to place problems in broad risk categories and to attempt to regulate risks that are of the highest priority.' For democratic reasons, it would also be desirable for OIRA to make information about risk categories broadly available to the public and to be responsive to the weight that the public places on various risks. The EPA undertook an early effort to this effect and updated it in 1990.' The 1990 study identified a number of "relatively high-risk problems," including habitat alteration and destruction, species extinction and loss of biological diversity, ozone depletion, and global climate change. It also found a number of "relatively medium-risk problems," including pesticides, surface water toxins, acid deposition, and airborne toxins. And it identified a number of "relatively low-risk" problems, including oil spills, radionuclides, groundwater pollution, and thermal pollution.' A 1994 report of the National Academy of Sciences basically approved the EPA's ranking and approach.' This might serve as a model for the federal government as a whole. 
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it would be desirable for the executive branch to identify its long-term risk-reduction goals, at least in broad terms, and to report on its progress toward reaching those goals. Executive Order 12866 contains no mechanism of this kind. 
In general, however, there is reason for optimism both in the maintenance of the OIRA reviewing process and in the steps to limit antagonism between the agencies and OIRA and to promote attention to shared regulatory goals. We now turn to some institutional details. 
The Reagan orders contained no provisions governing disclosure or regulation of communications between private parties and OIRA, or within the executive branch itself. The absence of formal procedures was itself a cause of considerable controversy.69 Many people alleged that private communications had occurred and that OIRA was basing its decisions on pressure from business groups with self-interested stakes in the outcome.7" 
As a matter of policy, the rules governing disclosure of communications with OIRA are quite important. Informal communications between the executive branch and affected citizens may be "the lifeblood of the administrative process,"7 in the sense that they may well be crucial to the development of sound regula

70 See Olson, 4 Va J Nat Resources L at 31-35 (cited in note 14); Percival, 54 L & Contemp Probs at 168-72 (cited in note 17). Early in the Reagan administration, the Department of Justice advised OMB to make public all substantive communications between OMB and private parties. See Stephen G. Breyer and Richard B. Stewart, Administrative Law and Regulatory Policy 684 (Little, Brown, 3d ed 1992), summarizing Memorandum from Larry Simms, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, to Director of the Office of Management and Budget (1981). An implementing memorandum from OIRA offered a complex set of guidelines. See Memorandum, Additional Procedures Concerning QIRA Reviews Under Executive OrderNos 12291 and 12498, from Wendy L. Gramm, Administrator, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, published in Office of Management and Budget, Regulatory Programof the United States Government,April 1, 1990-March 31, 1991 605 (US GPO, 1990). Congress held many hearings about the absence of disclosure of communications between OIRA and private groups, or between OIRA and the agency itself. See Clean Air Act Implementation (Part 2): Hearings before the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, 102d Cong, 1st & 2d Sess (1991-92). Informal agreements were reached between the White House and Congress, without formal legislation, requiring disclosure of most substantive communications from private parties. The understandings are published in the Congressional Record. See 136 Cong Rec S17608-10 (Oct 27, 1990). They did not, however, cover the Council on Competitiveness, which became the focal point of concern. See id.

If they are not, interviews can be helpful, but structured questionnaires might be used where the former are not feasible. The process of eliciting views should be at least somewhat open ended; investigators should not force the process into predetermined channels. The process might start with questions like "tell me about radon" and seek elaboration of the responses. Studies of different risk problems suggest that after twelve interviews or so, few new concepts emerge in the answers."o 
Second, initial material should be designed to provide the relevant information in a way that responds to those background beliefs. To the extent that the elicitation process reveals gaps and errors in these beliefs, the material should address them. In addition, rather than providing bare information, the material should provide it in a form directed to taking action. Third, the initial material should be tested empirically with potential users. Iterations of this process yield the most effective forms of information disclosure. 
Applying this approach in 1987, experts were able to generate a highly effective brochure for addressing the radon problem, a brochure that was far more effective than the widely distributed EPA brochure on that topic. The elicitation process revealed that, in addition to holding many accurate beliefs about radon exposure, people also held many inaccurate beliefs: that radon contamination of surfaces is permanent (39 percent); that radon affects plants (58 percent); that it contaminates blood (38 percent); and that it causes breast cancer (29 percent).38' Few people understood that radon decays quickly (13 percent).382 The combination of some of these beliefs would make the radon problem seem severe and unsolvable; consider the lack of knowledge of the fact that radon decays quickly. 
On the basis of this information, brochures were designed that specifically addressed the flaws and gaps in people's background beliefs. The unsuccessful EPA brochure had been prepared through traditional methods; scientific experts were asked what information was relevant and it was then packaged attractively. The initial version of EPA's "Citizen's Guide to Radon," for example, did not discuss whether radon contamination is perma

3" Id. nent. When empirically tested, this EPA brochure performed significantly worse than the brochures prepared through the alternative method. When people were asked to recall simple facts, they did equally well with all the brochures. But when faced with tasks requiring inference, the new brochures "dramatically outperformed" the EPA material.' For example, when asked what a homeowner could do to reduce high radon levels in the house, 43 percent of EPA readers answered "don't know" and 9 percent said "there is no way to fix the problem." In contrast, 100 percent of the readers of the brochure designed on the basis of risk communication studies, and 96 percent of the readers of another, answered "hire a contractor to fix the problem."384 
This approach stands in sharp contrast to that reflected in one of the most carefully prepared and broadly circulated manuals on risk information and its communication. This manual, produced for the Chemical Manufacturers Association, sought to provide advice to plant managers on the most effective means to make public comparisons between different kinds of risks. The chemical industry drew on literature concerning effective communication, but it did not test its manual empirically. When that was done, it turned out that the advice was flatly wrong. There was no correlation between actual public assessments of the risks and those the manual predicted.385 
Informational remedies should also respond to various heuristics and anomalies that can affect how people "hear" warnings and advice. For example, it matters a great deal whether a health effect is framed as a loss or a gain. People are far more willing to forego gains than to accept losses; they are persistently "loss averse,"1 6 and loss aversion affects people's reaction to information about risk. Thus, real-world experiments show that pamphlets describing the positive consequences of breast selfexaminations (for example, women who undertake such examinations have a greater chance of finding a tumor at a treatable stage) are ineffective, whereas there are significant changes in behavior from pamphlets that stress the negative consequences of a refusal to undertake self-examinations (women who fail to perform such examinations have a decreased chance of finding a tumor at a treatable stage)." Similar results were found for efforts to inform people of the advantages of energy insulation: an emphasis on the gains from insulation produced far less change than an emphasis on the losses from noninsulation.' 
Vivid and personal information can also be more effective than statistical evidence. The same study of energy conservation showed that it was not helpful for auditors to point to the cracks around homeowners' doors and to recommend weatherstripping. But striking results followed from a simple statement to the effect that the cracks, added together, would equal a hole the size of a basketball, combined with the question: "And if you had a hole that size in your wall, wouldn't you want to patch it up? That's what weatherstripping does." 89 So, too, the "availability" heuristic, discussed above,3" means that certain events that can be easily recalled will seem more probable than they are in fact; regulators should respond to and take advantage of this heuristic in attempting to convey accurate information. 
Finally, there is evidence that people sometimes try to reduce cognitive dissonance by discounting certain risks.39' When dissonance is at work, information about risk may be discounted, and hence information campaigns can fail. In order to convey information effectively, regulators should attempt to respond to danger posed by dissonance reduction. Efforts to convey information about the risk of AIDS, for example, appear to be adversely affected by a frequent tendency of people to assume that the risk does not apply to them.392 In many cases, this appears to be an irrational form of denial, spurred in part by a perception that condom use detracts from sexuality.393 It has been suggested that private and public actors concerned about the spread of AIDS should attempt to convey information not merely by stating the facts, but also by doing so in a way that is intentionally tar' Beth E.

Effective regulatory emphasis on information disclosure should learn from these risk-communication investigations. To provide meaningful information about risk, regulators should learn what people already know and assume, as well as what they need to know. Appropriate information must then be developed, tested, and refined until empirical investigation demonstrates that the intended information is, in fact, being conveyed. 95 The next step in information- and education-based regulatory strategies is to incorporate these insights. 
By economic incentives, we mean financial penalties imposed on harm-producing behavior, and financial rewards attached to harm-reducing behavior. Such penalties or rewards might supplement and sometimes even displace command-and-control regulation. The Clinton Order firmly and specifically endorses economic incentives; it favors performance standards over design standards and specifies "user fees or marketable permits" as remedies of choice. Economic incentives appear to be playing a role in the regulatory policy of the Clinton Administration.39 
The supporting work behind Executive Order 12866 recognizes that it is often inefficient for government to prescribe the means for achieving social objectives. 97 Often it would be far better, on economic grounds, for government (a) to create economic incentives to engage in socially desirable conduct, and (b) to permit the market to decide how companies respond to those incentives. It is especially inefficient for government to dictate technology. A far better approach is to impose a fee or a tax on harmful behavior,398 and to let market forces determine the re

Another good approach is for government to set the total quantity of a pollutant that will be permitted, then grant or sell a fixed number of tradable allowances or permits to discharge that substance. Government should generally impose fees on those who put pollutants into the atmosphere-instead of (for example) mandating a particular substance for use in motor vehicles. Consumption of the harm-producing good will decline. Producers will shift to less harmful methods of production. 
More generally, government might adopt a simple, two-step reform policy in the area of social risks and social harms. 99 First, those who impose harm should be required to pay for it-by purchasing permission to do so, perhaps through a licensing procedure. Second, those who obtain the resulting permission should be able to trade their "licenses" with other people. In the pollution context, this would mean that people who reduce their pollution below a specified level could trade their "pollution rights" for cash. In one move, such a system would create market-based disincentives to pollute and market-based incentives for pollution control. Such a system would also reward rather than punish technological innovation in pollution control, and do so with the aid of private markets. Very generally, and quite outside the environmental area, it makes sense to think about programs of this sort for regulation of harmful behavior."°° 
An idea of this kind might be made part and parcel of a system of "green taxes." With such a system, government might impose taxes rather than mandates on people who impose externalities on others-users of dirty automobiles, smokers, farmers who employ undesirable pesticides, coal-fired power plants, and users of other products that contribute to destruction of the ozone layer or to the greenhouse effect. Tax levies of various sorts are used by many nations already, though they have qualification is necessary here: Sometimes the apparent victim of the harmful conduct is in the best position to avoid the harm, and in such cases it is possible to say that the apparent victim should be charged with taking preventive or remedial measures. An example would be a case in which workers could cheaply prevent the costs of a chemical in the workplace by wearing masks or clothing that prevent the harm from occurring. Of course, there may be moral or other grounds for deciding not to place the responsibility to avoid harm on the cheapest cost avoider. 
' Here we generalize from the helpful discussion in Ackerman and Stewart, 13 Colum J Envir L 171 (cited in note 348). 
'4 The most controversial application would be civil rights, but some have taken the proposal seriously even there. See Jerry L. Mashaw, Implementing Quotas, 79 Georgetown L J 1769 (1991). been slow in coming to the United States."' These levies have had, or are projected to have, good results. Thus a higher tax on leaded gasoline in Great Britain increased the market share of unleaded gas from 4 percent to 30 percent within less than a year.4 2 It is estimated that a tripling of pesticide prices would cut pesticide use in half4.0 3 It is also estimated that a fee of $110 per ton on carbon would decrease carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent from previous 1988 levels by 2005.' An added advantage of such strategies is that they generate government revenues, thus reducing public deficits.4 5 
Economic incentives could be applied in other areas as well. Workers' compensation plans, for example, operate to enhance workplace safety. According to a careful study, "If the safety incentives of workers' compensation were removed, fatality rates in the United States economy would increase by almost 30 percent. Over 1,200 more workers would die from job injuries every year in the absence of the safety incentives provided by workers' compensation."4 6 This contrasts with a mere 2-4 percent reduction in injuries from OSHA, an amount that links up well with the fact that annual workers' compensation premiums are more than one thousand times as large as total annual OSHA penalties.40 7 The tax system could be used to punish employers who provide dangerous workplaces. 
It is well understood that economic incentives have advantages from the standpoint of efficiency, and thus far we have seen that a shift to incentives would probably be efficient and effective. What consequences would such a shift have for democratic government? 
The answer is that it could have significant beneficial consequences."° The current system puts public attention in the 41 A study by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development found over ffty environmental charges among fourteen of its members.

The point is nicely treated in Ackerman and Stewart, 13 Colum J Envir L 171 (cited in note 348), and we draw on their discussion here. wrong places. Imagine, for example, that Congress and the citizenry-following the contemporary model-are focusing on whether ethanol, or some other gasoline substitute, should be required in new cars. It is perfectly predictable that in answering this question, well-organized groups with significant stakes in the outcome will bring their influence to bear. It is also predictable that producers of the competing products may seek and actually obtain regulatory benefits, and for reasons bearing little or no relationship to environmental protection. 
At the same time, the underlying substantive question-whether ethanol is actually an environmentally superior product-will have to be resolved on the basis of technological complexities not easily addressed by the public or its representatives. If this is the issue on which the political process focuses, there is likely to be a series of laws that represent not publicspirited deliberation with a measure of broad accountability, but instead trade-offs among well-organized private groups, or, in Madisonian terms, government by faction. By directing attention to means, this system creates strong incentives for interest groups to ensure that they are favored in the legislature or the bureaucracy. 
Compare a system of economic incentives. Here the issue is not one of means, but the amount of sulfur dioxide that will be allowed into the atmosphere-an issue to be resolved in the process of deciding how many licenses to be given out, and for how much pollution. An advantage of this shift is that it would ensure that citizens and representatives would be focusing on how much pollution reduction there should be, and at what cost. The right question would be put squarely before the electorate. No longer would it be possible to pretend that environmental protection is costless. No longer would the central issue be displaced by the largely incidental question of means. 
Moreover, a system of financial penalties or rewards allows less room for interest-group maneuvering. The large question-how much environmental protection at what cost-does not permit legislators to favor a well-organized, narrow group, such as the agricultural lobby or the coal lobby. Special favors cannot be provided so readily through a system of economic incentives. The very generality of the question will work against narrow favoritism. To be sure, the ultimate question of pollution reduction may be answered in a way that reflects sustained political pressure rather than democratic deliberation. But the risks are reduced, certainly as compared with the existing system. 
There are other democratic advantages as well. Economic incentives should simultaneously promote coordination and rationality in regulation by giving government an incentive to attend closely, and for the first time, to how other risks are treated. This should bring a salutary measure of structure and sense to risk regulation in general. As an important by-product, the new system should create a powerful incentive to obtain information about the actual effects of pollution and pollution control. If members of Congress are deciding on the level of risk reduction, they will not want to do so in a vacuum, especially in light of the significant costs of large reductions. Affected groups will therefore be encouraged to engage in research about real-world consequences. 
As we have seen, information about consequences frequently remains in its most preliminary stages. The new premium placed on information should be a particularly important gain. There is every reason to design a regulatory strategy that puts a premium on greater research, so that when we act, we know what we are getting, and at what price. 
All these considerations suggest that economic incentives-favored so firmly on economic grounds-have as one of their principal justifications a series of democracy-reinforcing, faction-limiting characteristics. 9 
The movement toward economic incentives is preliminary but real. Thus far, it has occurred mostly in the environmental area. An important series of administrative initiatives have brought about "emissions trading," especially under the Clean Air Act.41 Under EPA's policy, a firm that reduces its emissions below legal requirements may obtain "credits" that can be used against higher emissions elsewhere. Through the "offset" policy, which is formally codified in the Clean Air Act,41' a company may locate in an area not in compliance with national air quality standards if and only if it can offset the new emissions by reducing existing emissions, either from its own sources or from other firms. 
4r But see Heinzerling, 62 U Chi L Rev at 471-72 (cited in note 190), for cautionary note4s1.0 See Environmental Protection Agency, Emissions Trading Policy Statement; General Principles for Creation, Banking and Use of Emission Reduction Credits, 51 Fed Reg 43814 (1986). 
411 42 USC § 7503(c) (1988 & Supp 1992). Through the "banking" policy, firms are permitted to store emission credits for their own future use.412 Companies may also engage in "netting," by which a firm modifies a source, but avoids otherwise-applicable emissions limits by reducing emissions from another source within the same plant. Existing sources may also place an imaginary "bubble" over their plants, allowing increased emissions levels for some emitting devices, so long as the total emissions level meets the aggregate requirements. 
We now have a good deal of evidence about the emissions trading program. For various reasons, the program's use has been quite limited.41 A 1989 study showed forty-two federal bubbles, ninety state bubbles, two thousand federal offsets, between five thousand and twelve thousand acts of netting, and one hundred acts of banking.414 Despite this limited activity, there is considerable evidence that this policy has been successful. Overall, the program has produced savings of between $525 million and $12 billion.415 By any measure, this is a large gain. On balance, moreover, the environmental consequences have been neutral or better. Offsets must, by definition, produce environmental gains. The preliminary evidence shows favorable effects from bubbles as well.4"6 There may be modest beneficial effects from banking and modest adverse effects from netting4.1 ' The overall environmental effect is therefore neutral or even good, cost entirely to one side. Consider the following table by way of summary:

EPA has also permitted emissions trading for lead. Under this policy, a refinery that produced gasoline with lower-thanrequired lead levels could earn credits. These could be traded with other refineries or banked for future use.419 Until the program's termination in 1987, when the phasedown of lead ended, emissions credits for lead were widely traded. EPA concluded that there had been cost savings of about 20 percent over alternative systems, making total savings in the hundreds of millions 
Reinventing the RegulatoryState of dollars.42 There have been initial administrative efforts as well with respect to water pollution and ozone depletion.42' 
The most dramatic program of economic incentives can be found in the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act. The Act now explicitly creates an emissions trading system for the control of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, major contributors to acid deposition. In these amendments, Congress has made an explicit decision about the aggregate emissions level for a pollutant.' The goal is to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by ten million tons each year, with initial standards going into place in 1995 and much tighter standards coming into effect by 2000.' Whether the particular decision about the size of the reduction is the correct one may well be disputed. But there are large democratic benefits from ensuring that public attention is focused on that issue. 
The acid deposition provisions have other beneficial features. Congress has said that polluters may obtain allowances for emissions avoided through energy conservation and renewable energy. In this way, conservation strategies are made privately profitable.424 This provision creates an incentive to shift to conservation and renewable sources, without providing further environmental degradation. 
Moreover, polluters are explicitly permitted to trade their allowances; this is a first in national legislative policy.' In this way, entities that are able to reduce their pollution below the specified level receive economic benefits. An especially intriguing provision allows spot and advance sales of sulfur dioxide allowances, to be purchased at $1,500 per ton.426 Through this route, polluters must-for the first time-pay a fee for their pollution.

4 42 USC § 7651b(b). Equally intriguing is a provision calling for auction sales of specified numbers of sulfur dioxide allowances.4"7 Here the market is permitted to set the price for polluting activity. For example, in the first auction of these rights, in 1993, the average price for the right to discharge one ton of sulfur dioxide in 1995 was $156; by 1994, the market price had risen to $159 per ton.428 
For the most part, however, the Clean Air Act does not require polluters to pay for their "licenses." Instead, government is granting initial marketable pollution allowances to existing sources for free. This might be a short-term measure to protect reliance interests underlying existing uses, for political or more substantive reasons. As further experience with these approaches develops, perhaps Congress will take the next step of requiring dischargers to pay for their emissions by requiring polluters to purchase their allowances in the first place. Executive Order 12866 holds out promise that future legislative and administrative initiatives will pursue regulation through incentive-altering structures more fully. 
Executive Order 12866 is already having significant effects on the development of alternative regulatory strategies. The Clean Water Act is up for reauthorization this year, and the Clinton Administration, through EPA, has put forward a comprehensive set of proposals for revamping administration of the Act (the Clean Water Initiative, or "CWI"). These proposals include measures to deal with toxic discharges; nonpoint sources of pollution; watersheds; and the funding, monitoring, and enforcement aspects of water pollution control. 
The Clinton CWI reflects the Executive Order's influence at every turn and, more generally, the prevalent techniques by which regulatory policy is now made. To begin with, the CWI is accompanied by an extensive analysis of the benefits and costs of the proposed new regulatory approaches.2 9 Moreover, where commensurating benefits and costs would involve controversial value judgments, the analysis does not attempt to force a single metric on the problem and obscure important qualitative distinc4 Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 § 416(d), 104 Stat at 2629, codified at 42 USC § 7651o(d) (Supp 1993). 
' Utilitiesgobble up air-pollutioncredits, Chi Trib § 3 at 3 (Mar 30, 1994). 41 President Clinton's Clean Water Initiative: Analysis of Benefits and Costs, Environmental Protection Agency 800-R-94-002 (Mar 1994). tions. For example, the analysis carefully documents the physical water-quality benefits to be expected without attempting to monetize these in order to "weigh" them against costs.' ° In one area where some basis for attaching dollar values to the relevant benefits plausibly exists (the value to urban households of clean water for various purposes), the analysis attempts to do so." But the analysis does not hide the uncertainty behind these estimates, and it consistently makes its underlying assumptions clear. A strong emphasis is placed throughout on more flexible regulatory strategies that pursue the most cost-effective approach to producing a given level of benefits. 
Thus, rather than requiring all municipalities (as current law does) to meet the same standards for combined sewer overflows and storm water discharges, the CWI proposes different regulatory regimes for large and small cities." Similarly, the CWI proposes building on the recent Clean Air Act approach by using market mechanisms, such as tradable permits, to improve water quality in the most efficient way. The basic concept here is that all sources discharging into the same body of water in a similar manner should be permitted to negotiate among themselves (through trading discharge permits) as to how to achieve a federal water-quality standard for that body. EPA estimates that about 940 bodies of water would benefit from trades between certain point sources and nonpoint sources, and 210 bodies of water would be able to benefit from trades between point sources. 3 In addition, EPA has identified numerous public treatment plants that would be able to reduce pollution more cheaply by negotiating reductions in inputs from the relevant sources. All told, EPA estimates that permitting trades of these sorts would achieve the same level of water-quality improvement at savings of between $658 million to $7.5 billion peryear.4 ' "' Thus, EPA projects that its proposals for nonpoint source controls will produce measurable water-quality improvements in 7.1 million lake acres and 156,200 river miles; or that these proposals have a "high or medium" likelihood of producing measurable improvement in 52 percent of impaired or threatened rivers and 63 percent of lakes. Id at ES-7. Similarly, the proposals for addressing combined sewer overflows are estimated to reduce the average number of overflows from fifty to eighty events per year to approximately three to four; this would reduce the number of water-quality violations for each system from one hundred to two hundred days per year to ten to twenty, and reduce by 35 to 65 percent the annual discharges of various chemicals and toxic substances. Id at 23-24.

This attention to more flexible, cost-effective regulatory strategies is evidenced in the Initiative's bottom-line summary of its cost consequences. The analysis projects that if the CWI were adopted as proposed, it would lead to additional incremental expenditures of $5 to $9.6 billion per year." But the analysis also claims that this is vastly less-amounting to savings of $29 to $33.8 billion-than would be generated under the regulatory approaches required by current law. 8 The important point is not that these numbers are to be believed (although even if discounted substantially, they still suggest roughly the magnitude of expected savings from more flexible regulatory strategies). More significantly, Executive Order 12866 is already bringing about systematic analysis of major new regulatory initiatives by encouraging new means to environmental ends. 
In some areas, economic incentives are inappropriate. If government seeks to ban a substance entirely, a prohibition makes sense, rather than a high fee for marketing or use. At least if the benefits of the substance do not outweigh the danger, and if less dangerous substitutes are available, a ban is the preferred course. 
In addition, where economic incentives are warranted, it is sometimes best to regulate quantity rather than price. Marketable permits that regulate the quantity discharged, rather than emission fees, may well be the better approach to market strategies for pollution reduction. Setting emission fees at the right level to achieve the desired reduction requires detailed (marginal cost and benefit) information, which is usually unavailable, with respect to an industry's demand curve for emissions. In contrast, once the acceptable total level of emissions is determined, it is much easier to determine the appropriate quantity different producers should be permitted to discharge. That is what quantity-based marketable permits or allowances do. When these permits are traded, the market will then set their price. Although emissions fees are typically the way theorists analyze incentive approaches to pollution regulation, these approaches are often more appropriately pursued through quantity-based permits or 43 Id at ES-1. 
' Id. The document refers to the larger figure that current law would require as being based on a "stringent interpretation" of current law. Id. " 1995] allowances." Auctions are also a promising approach, with the benefit of market rather than governmental setting of initial prices for the allowances." 
On the other hand, fees or taxes may sometimes be preferable. An advantage of taxes as a response to (say) pollution problems is that the government need not even calculate the socially optimal level of pollution, a complex question to be sure. Rather than compute the tax at a level designed to achieve a predetermined quantity (a difficult task, for reasons described above), government could simply tax polluters at a level equal to the harm done to others from the pollution generated. On a standard view, this would generally equal the lower of either the cleanup costs, or the amount of money society is willing to accept in exchange for living with the pollution. Under this approach, the polluters would internalize the social cost of polluting, and would have every incentive to pollute at the socially optimal level. Computing the social harm done from a given unit of pollution may well be easier in many contexts than computing the total socially optimal quantity. Moreover, this approach allows the market to respond to fluctuations in the socially optimal quantity, which may frequently arise from changes in technology, market substitutes, increased demand, and so forth. 
The main difficulty with this approach stems from the problem of calculating the amount of the fee or tax. Cleanup costs are often incalculable, and there are problems with relying on aggregated willingness to pay, even if it is calculable."9 Nonetheless, there are undoubtedly circumstances in which pollution taxes are better than quantity limits, because taxes are a better response to government's informational limits. Which approach is best cannot be decided in the abstract. 
As we have noted, sometimes economic incentives are undesirable for what we have described as expressive reasons. Perhaps a curbside tax is a more efficient response to the problem of solid waste disposal than mandatory recycling, at least in the short term (though this could encourage people to dispose of their wastes in more covert, and environmentally harmful, ways)."0

See generally Peter S. Menell, Beyond the Throwaway Society: An Incentive Approachto RegulatingMunicipalSolid Waste, 17 Ecol L Q 655, 687-90 (1990). But mandatory recycling might affect social norms with respect to consumption, waste disposal, and environmental protection, in a way that has better long-term consequences, and that in any case responds better to the public's understanding of how best to conceive of social obligations in the area of solid waste disposal. The choice between curbside taxes and mandatory recycling cannot be resolved in the abstract. But insofar as economic incentives treat a public bad as a commodity, they might be objectionable on expressive grounds. It is rarely urged, for example, that the emissions trading model makes sense in the antidiscrimination area; a "discrimination license" would be inconsistent with the general effort to delegitimate racial prejudice."' 
A final problem is that a system of economic incentives can bring about distortions that must be addressed through governmental action. In the environmental area, emissions trading programs can lead to "hot spots," which occur when trades lead sources to concentrate pollution in some local area."2 There are important equitable issues here, connected to those treated above: the "hot spots" may have unfortunate distributional effects, burdening identifiable social groups."3 This is less of a problem to the extent that the pollutant has no local effects and is troubling only when mixed in a larger environment (which might be true, to a significant degree, of sulfur dioxide).'" But where local concentration effects are a problem, controls on trades or location of sources will have to be reintroduced. Indeed, the regulatory approach to trades in nitrogen oxides already manifests such an approach. Unlike with sulfur dioxides, trades in nitrogen oxides (which cause smog) must be approved by environmental officials in the states where the extra pollutants will be admitted; in addition, such trades are supposed to be "directionally correct," in that sellers must be upwind of buyers."5 41 But see Mashaw, 79 Georgetown L J 1769 (cited in note 400); the idea is proposed by way of satire in Derrick Bell, And We Are Not Saved.

The right solution varies from context to context, but it seems likely that appropriate structures and policies can be developed to address these concerns.' 
This Article has emphasized three principal points. The first involves regulatory institutions. The second involves regulatory ends. The third involves regulatory means. 
We have suggested that an institution in OMB to oversee and coordinate regulatory policy is, at least potentially, highly salutary. Staffed by appropriate employees, such an entity could help coordinate solutions to similar problems that arise across different agencies. Moreover, by introducing a more comprehensive perspective on risk regulation, such a body could encourage sensible priority setting. Executive Order 12866 takes coordination a step further than the Reagan-Bush approaches. It does so, most importantly, by attempting to promote early intrabranch discussion of regulatory proposals and to ensure more continuous consultation about regulatory goals. This reform is part of a conspicuous effort to reduce agency-OIRA antagonism by encouraging cooperation at all stages of rule making. The Order also takes the important step of including the independent agencies, if only in a modest, procedurally oriented way. 
Executive Order 12866 begins as well to address the conflict between centralization and participation. The Order requires disclosure of contacts with private groups. It also opens up the process of discussion between OMB and the agencies-a step that might be legally unnecessary, but is nonetheless desirable. Finally, the Order is plainly designed to take advantage of information from affected persons at early stages of agency action. 7 These measures reflect appreciation not only of the need for relevant information, but also of the central role that public trust plays in risk perception, evaluation, and remediation. 
With respect to the current institutional framework, our principal suggestion is that in its implementation, Executive Order 12866 should be used to create better priority setting. This ' See Howard Latin, Ideal Versus Real Regulatory Efficiency: Implementation of Uniform Standardsand "Fine-Tuning"Regulatory Reforms, 37 Stan L Rev 1267, 1331-32 (1985). 
"' See Exec Order No 12866 §§ 1(b)(9), 4(e), 3 CFR at 640, 643-44 (cited in note 18). See also the remarks of Sally Katzen, Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, in Colloquium, 8 Admin L JAm U at 53 (cited in note 18). idea is only incipient in Executive Order 12866. Toward this end, OIRA (perhaps bolstered by the addition of employees trained in relevant fields in addition to economics and policy analysis) should generate recommendations about which risk priorities ought to be viewed as most pressing." As we have emphasized, the judgment about which risks are most pressing, and about which problems are most severe, does not depend solely on quantity or on numbers of lives saved. It depends a great deal on the context in which risks are imposed and on such factors as whether relevant risks are catastrophic, irreversible, involuntarily imposed, faced by future generations, or inequitably distributed. 
Precisely how these recommendations might be turned into policy commitments requires further thought about the best mix of democratic and technocratic influences. Certainly, OIRA's efforts are unlikely to be productive without a firm commitment to better risk management at the presidential or vice presidential level. Under the right circumstances, OIRA might be given some substantive power to define risk priorities, or perhaps Congress would act on OIRA's recommendations. For now, OIRA could at least move the reform process forward by providing information and recommendations about risk priorities. As we have said, this view of OIRA's role is, at most, incipient in Executive Order 12866, but we think such a role would contribute significantly to improving regulation. 
In order to monitor OIRA activity, new mechanisms should be created to allow something in the way of official and private "performance review," through studies showing which regulations have been issued by the Administration, with particular attention to their anticipated and actual real-world consequences. Such a step would create good incentives for OIRA and also enable the public to see what, as a matter of substance, has been done in the regulatory arena. Thus far OIRA's attention appears to have been focused mostly on procedural matters,"9 and insufficiently on the hard (and far more important) substantive issues involved in improving regulation. 
On the question of regulatory ends, Executive Order 12866 is, perhaps understandably, a bit uncertain. The Order does not embody a clear conception of what it means for regulation to be rational. The Order qualifies the Reagan-Bush conception of costbenefit analysis, but it does not reject the technique entirely. 
See Colloquium, 8 Admin L J Am U at 53 (cited in note 18). 
See Report on Executive Order No 12866, 59 Fed Reg at 24290 (cited in note 28). Instead, it requires a modified form of cost-benefit analysis, one that calls on agencies to incorporate ambiguous concerns for "equity" and "distributive impacts" into CBA. There is evident doubt about the prior use of cost-benefit techniques; attenuated endorsement of the basic method; and vague modifications that leave the final outcome, in terms of actual effects on agency policy, quite unpredictable. 
The best way to progress beyond this ambivalence is to recognize its causes. We have focused on three such causes: legitimate conflicts between expert and lay value systems and conceptions of rationality; the incommensurability of some benefits and costs that can only be compared qualitatively; and the relevance of expressive concerns in choosing regulatory policies. We do not urge a general abandonment of analytic approaches to regulatory policy, nor do we deny the importance of CBA or comparative risk assessment, especially in a period in which regulation is far too costly a means of achieving its own goals. We have, however, argued for qualifying conventional CBA, and for embodying in CRA an understanding of qualitative differences among risks. Perhaps the qualification could take place through formal analysis that incorporates unconventional variables. But if we attempt to incorporate all relevant concerns into policy analysis at the same time, we risk undermining the genuine benefits that more analytic approaches can provide. 
Instead, we might split the process of CBA into two stages. In the first, the focus should be on a quantitative cost-benefit assessment of those dimensions that can properly be subject to this approach. To deal with incommensurability problems, the analysis should disaggregate benefits and costs so as to indicate how they are distributed over various groups and interests. In the second stage, agencies should take into account differences between expert and lay value frameworks, concerns for equity, the expressive dimensions of the choice, and other relevant values not subject to the cost-benefit approach. Perhaps mechanisms could be created to promote citizen evaluation of regulatory alternatives, though any efforts in this direction must necessarily be tentative and experimental. CRA might proceed similarly, with attention to the sorts of factors that we have emphasized here. 
With respect to regulatory means, Executive Order 12866 is also a step in the right direction. A pervasive problem with national regulatory law is the use of rigid, highly bureaucratized command-and-control regulation, which dictates, at the national level, risk control strategies for hundreds, thousands, or millions of companies in an exceptionally diverse nation. Such regulation is highly inefficient. Even more fundamentally, such strategies are deficient from the standpoint of a well-functioning democratic process. Often they ensure that citizens and representatives will be devoting their attention not to general questions of value-what levels of risk reduction and cost trade-offs are appropriate-but instead to the largely incidental and publicly inaccessible question of what technologies are now available. They focus on the question of regulatory "means," a focus that increases the power of well-organized private groups by allowing them to press the law in the service of their own parochial ends. 
In this light, it is no wonder that some observers think that our current system is a kind of Madisonian nightmare, in which James Madison's vision of deliberative democracy has been transformed into a system of government as a series of interest-group deals.450 Executive Order 12866 holds out much promise on this front. It adopts a kind of presumption against command-andcontrol regulation. It presages a greater shift to economic incentives, to informational remedies, and to performance rather than design standards. All of these are desirable suggestions. But we have cautioned that some of these new strategies are not likely to be effective unless they deal with the ways in which ordinary people process and conceive of risks. 
The solution to this problem lies in strategies that respond to people's background assumptions and to their diverse valuations of diverse risks. Indeed, a principle of this kind-that risk evaluation should take into account informed public valuations-should be placed at the center of modern efforts to reinvent the regulatory state. We have suggested that such efforts could promote economic goals, by reducing the billions of dollars unnecessarily spent on regulation and by ensuring that resources are devoted to the many serious problems that remain inadequately addressed. Such efforts could promote democratic goals as well, by reducing interest-group power, poor priority setting unreflective of public judgments, and the role of sensationalist anecdotes in regulatory policy. A reinvented government could simultaneously increase efficiency and improve the democratic character of the regulatory state. This task has technocratic dimensions, but it is far from only technocratic. It also requires government to respond to public understandings and valuations 4- See Stewart, 57 U Chi L Rev 335 (cited in note 346).

The Bill of Rights has now been part of the United States Constitution for more than two hundred years. In the recent past, that short document has inspired reform movements throughout the world-not merely in the Soviet Union, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and East Germany, but in such places as South Africa, China, and Taiwan as well. It is therefore nothing short of remarkable that the international interest in the Bill of Rights has come at a time when the very concept of rights, or of a polity pervaded by rights, is under attack in the United States. 
The attack on rights has sometimes been highly influential. It underlies a prominent new journal, The Responsive Community, and it cuts across ideological lines.' Justice Clarence Thomas has delivered a passionate and widely reported plea for responsibilities instead of rights.' In so saying, Justice Thomas echoed a general * Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Jurisprudence and Co-Director of the Center on Constitutionalism in Eastern Europe, University of Chicago Law School and Department of Political Science.

Various challenges to rights can be found in the journal founded by Professor Etzioni, THE RESPONSIVE COMMUNITY. See, e.g., The Responsive Communitarian Platform: Rights and Responsibilities, RESPONSIVE COMMUNITY, Winter 1991/92, at 4, 18-20 (listing 57 signatories to the platform). Something with parallel concern, I believe, underlies RICHARD D. PARKER, "HERE, THE PEOPLE RULE": A CONSTITUTIONAL POPULIST MANIFESTO (1994), and also CHRISTINA HOFF SOMMERS, WHO STOLE FEMINISM?

2 Justice Clarence Thomas, The Rights Revolution and America's Urban Poor Vicclaim about the pathologies of legal practices during the Warren Court era. More generally, it is urged that a culture of rights encourages a form of selfishness and an unwillingness to compromise that are incompatible with citizenship.' Along related but distinct lines, academic critics have suggested that aggressive judicial review or perhaps judicial review itself, protecting identified rights, is by its nature incompatible with democracy.4 
These various claims have received hospitable receptions in prominent places. Many of the Supreme Court's recent decisions embrace the idea that the creation of rights can be destructive to democratic governance.5 The attack on "substantive due process" reflects this claim quite vividly.' In recent deliberations, Congress and the executive branch have been increasingly attentive to the view that government, instead of recognizing rights, should encourage people to exercise greater responsibility.7 On this view, those who are disadvantaged should take their welfare into their own hands and should not expect assistance from government operating in response to claims of right. Moreover, it is said, those who are advantaged should respond not to rights laid down by the state, but to their own sense of responsibility to people in need. If the 1960s and the early 1970s were an era of rights, it seems likely that the 1990s will be a period in which responsibilities move increasingly to the fore. tims or Beneficiaries?, Address Before the Federalist Society and the Manhattan Institute (May 16, 1994), in 60 VITAL SPEECHES OF THE DAY 514, 514-17 (1994); see also, e.g., Neil A.

Many critics of rights observe that American political debate, especially since the New Deal, has come to center on a bewildering and proliferating array of "rights"-that it has yielded to a kind of "rights revolution" involving the courts, Congress, and the President.' These rights, many of them quite novel, include a wide range of safeguards for criminal defendants; prevention against the abuse and neglect of children; guarantees to improve the treatment of the mentally and physically disabled;9 protection of consumers from sharp practices; and a remarkable array of efforts to safeguard the environment." To be sure, some people think that the growing list of rights is an important or precious social achievement, supplementing a catalog of protected interests started but hardly finished in the founding period. But many others disagree. They believe that America's transformation into "the land of rights" has had harmful, even disastrous consequences. 12 
My goal in this Essay is to disaggregate and to evaluate the claims now brought against rights. I suggest that much of the attack is based on confusion and on a failure to make necessary distinctions. The attack is best aimed at particular rights, not at rights as such. In its usual form, it depends on a misunderstanding of what rights are and of what they do. It rests on empirical claims that are hard to support. It offers a cultural diagnosis that is only part of a complex picture, for there has been no general shift to rights from responsibilities. 
In the end, I claim that the critique of rights has no merit as such, and that the plausible claims that it contains should be stated far more cautiously and narrowly. When so stated, the claims can be discussed as part of a debate over which rights it is best to have, rather than as a debate over whether rights are pernicious merely by virtue of being rights.

I. 
THE CHARGES 
Numerous charges have been made against rights, and it will be useful to begin by separating distinct claims that tend to be run together. We might disaggregate the charges into six different categories. 
The Social Foundations of Rights 
Some people suggest, as part of their critique of rights, that rights are essentially social and collective in character and that the rhetoric of rights obscures this point1. 3 For example, rights come from the state in the sense that they depend for their existence on collective institutions. 4 Without the law of property, set out by the collectivity, property rights cannot be secure. Without the law of contract, saying that agreements are enforceable under certain conditions, contracts could not exist in the way that we understand them. In the critics' view, many claims based on rights, and especially claims for individual rights, tend to disguise the social character of rights and in particular the need for collective and communal support. 5 The result, it is said, is confusion and an inability to draw lines between rights that are desirable from the social point of view and rights that are not. 
Other critics charge that rights have a strident and absolutist character, and that for this reason they impoverish political discourse. 6 Rights do not admit of compromise. They do not allow room for competing considerations. For this reason, they impair and even foreclose deliberation over complex issues not realistically soluble by simple formulas. Rights thus have many of the defects of rules.t7 A person claiming a right-for example, a handicapped person claiming that all buildings should be accessible to people who use wheelchairs-may not be willing to allow a process of balancing in which we judge, for example, whether accessibility for wheelchairs really makes sense in light of the relevant costs and benefits. A characteristic problem with rules is that they do not permit people to make individual judgments about whether following the rules really is reasonable in particular cases. 9 Rights have the identical problem. 
Rooted in nineteenth-century ideas of absolute sovereignty over property, rights are said to be ill-adapted to what we usually need, that is, a careful discussion of trade-offs and competing concerns. If rights are (in Ronald Dworkin's suggestive and influential phrase, criticized below) "trumps,"20 they are for that very reason harmful to the difficult process of accommodating different goals and considerations in resolving such thorny problems as abortion, the environment, and plant closings. 
C. Indeterminacy 
In one of his greatest aphorisms, Justice Holmes wrote that "[g]eneral propositions do not decide concrete cases."2' Rights,. of course, take the form of general propositions. For this reason they are said to be indeterminate and thus unhelpful.22 
If we know that there is a right to private property, we do not know whether an occupational safety and health law or a law requiring beach access is permissible. In fact, we know relatively little. Standing by itself, the constitutional protection against govemnment "takings" tells us very little about how to handle particular problems. This is true of rights generally. To say that there is a right to equal protection of the law is not to say, for example, that affirmative action programs are acceptable, mandatory, or prohibited. In fact, the right to equal protection of the law re17 See, e.g., HOWARD, supra note 1,at 116-33. 18 See id. at 113-18. 
19 See EUGENE BARDACH1 & ROBERT A. KAGAN, GOING BY THE BOOK: THE PROBLEM OF REGULATORY UNREASONABLENESS (1982). 
20 RONALD DWORKIN, TAING RIGHTS SERIOUSLY xi (1977) ("Individual rights are political trumps held by individuals."). 
21 Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 76 (1904) (Holmes, J., dissenting). 22 See, e.g., Tushnet, supra note 1, at 1371-76. quires a great deal of supplemental work to decide cases. The right must be specified in order to have concrete meaning. The specification will depend on premises not contained within the announcement of the right itself.3 Rights purport to solve problems, but when stated abstractly-it is claimed-they are at most the beginning of a discussion. 
Perhaps the area of free speech is the most vivid illustration. Everyone agrees that such a right exists; but without supplemental work, we cannot know how to handle the hard questions raised by commercial speech, libel, obscenity, or campaign finance restrictions. A serious problem with modern free speech discussions is that the term "free speech" tends to be used as if it handled the hard questions by itself.24 
D. Excessive Individualism 
A different objection is that rights are unduly individualistic and associated with highly undesirable characteristics, including selfishness and indifference to others.25 Rights miss the "dimension of sociality;"" they posit selfish, isolated individuals who assert what is theirs, rather than participating in communal life. Rights, it is said, neglect the moral and social dimensions of important problems. 
The important and contested right of privacy, for example, is said to have emerged as an unduly individual right, rooted in the "property paradigm" and loosened from connections to others. Critics urge that this conception of the issues involved in the so-called privacy cases misses crucial aspects of the relevant problems-abortion, family living arrangements, and the asserted right to die. Such issues do not involve simple privacy; they call up a range of issues about networks of relationships, between individuals and the state, between individuals and families, between individuals and localities. Perhaps the abortion issue is especially problematic when conceived in terms of a "right to privacy." Many people, on both sides of the abortion controversy, are uncomfortable with the "privacy" rhetoric. Inattentive to the unborn or to 23 See Henry Richardson, Specifying Norms as a Way to Resolve Concrete Ethical Problems, 19 PHIL. & PUB. AFF. 306 (1990). 
24 This is a problem in NADINE STROSSEN, DEFENDING PORNOGRAPHY: FREE SPEECH, SEX, AND THE FIGHT FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS (1995). 
25 See GLENDON, supra note 1, at 75, 178; Tushnet, supra note 1. 26 See GLENDON, supra note 1,at 109-44. 27 See id. at 20-25, 48-50. the situation of mothers, American law has been said to have, perversely, left the pregnant woman genuinely alone, without people "willing to help her either to have the abortion she desired, or to keep and raise the child who was eventually born."' 
Similarly, American law is said to be unequipped even to describe the harms faced by a community destroyed by the closing of a plant employing most of its members. These harms include the loss of a rich neighborhood life-"roots, relationships, solidarity, sense of place, and shared memory . . . ."' On the critics' view, the individualistic character of recent formulations has left Americans with a crucial linguistic and conceptual deficiency. Rights talk is a principal culprit. Since rights are claimed by individuals, it is said, rights promote and encourage a community whose members think of social problems in the most narrow, self-interested terms. 
E. Protection of Existing Distributionsand Practices 
To some critics, a key problem with rights is that they tend to be used for what the critics see as pernicious ends. Partly because rights are indeterminate in the abstract, they can be used as an excessively conservative and antidemocratic force, protecting exist- ing distributions from scrutiny and change."' Some people think that the historical function of rights has been to insulate current practice from legitimate democratic oversight. Thus the Fifth Amendment was invoked to protect slavery before the Civil War;31 thus the Fourteenth Amendment was used to attack social welfare legislation in the early part of this century;, 2 thus the First Amendment is used to invalidate campaign finance legislation3 today.4 
On this view, rights are too readily invoked in the service of goals that are unworthy or that at least should be subject to democratic rather than judicial resolution. A key problem with rights is that they are brought in the service of existing distributions of authority and power. 
F. Rights Versus Responsibilities 
A final and especially prominent objection is that the emphasis on rights tends to crowd out the issue of responsibility. In American law and in American public discourse, some critics complain, it is too rare to find the idea that people owe duties to each other, or that civic virtue is to be cultivated, prized, and lived. Rights, and especially new protections of rights since the 1960s, are said to be a major problem here. 
In a simple formulation: People who insist on their rights too infrequently explore what it is right to do. Or they become dependent on the official institutions charged with safeguarding rights, rather than doing things for themselves. The controversy over whether rights turn women or blacks into a "dependent class" is in part about this issue. 5 People who insist that their status as victims entitles them to enforce their legal rights may not conceive of themselves in ways that engender equality and equal citizenship. 
Thus Justice Thomas has objected to the "judicial revolution in individual rights," and has challenged as harmful "the idea that our society had failed to safeguard the interests of minorities, the poor and other groups; and, as a consequence, was, in fact, primarily at fault for their plight."36 Justice Thomas particularly lamented the fact that "[m ]any began questioning whether the poor and minorities could be blamed for the crimes they committed."37 In his view, "[o]ur legal institutions and popular culture began identifying those accused of wrong doing as victims of upbringing and circumstance."' This was unfortunate, for "[i]n the long run, a society that abandons personal responsibility will lose its moral sense. And it is the urban poor whose lives are being destroyed the most by this loss of moral sense." 9 According to Justice Thomas: 
35 See, e.g., KATHERINE ROIPHE, THE MORNING AFrER: FEAR, SEX AND FEMINISM ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES (1993); SOMMERS, supra note 1. 
36 Thomas, supra note 2, at 516. 37 Id. 38 Id. 39 Id. at 517. . . . and that circumscribed the authority of local communities to set standards for decorum and civility on the streets or in the public schools also made it far more difficult for the criminal justice system to hold people responsible for the consequences of their harmful acts." When black people insist on rights and "demand ...from [their] oppressors [] more lenient standards of conduct," they produce a state of dependency worse than slavery." 
Professor Mary Ann Glendon, an especially prominent and evenhanded critic of rights, is similarly concerned about the effects of rights on responsibilities.42 Thus Glendon devotes a good deal of space to the "duty to rescue," a duty not recognized by American law.43 If a person ignores someone who is drowning, he will not be held accountable, even if rescue could occur with little effort. Glendon deplores this result, arguing at a minimum for a statement, in law, that such a duty exists. On Glendon's view, it is important to attend to responsibility as well as rights. American law does this far too infrequently. 
Along similar lines, Glendon challenges the view (on which the current Supreme Court is increasingly insistent4 ) that the Constitution imposes no affirmative duties on government. She suggests, though with some ambivalence, that police officers should be obliged to protect people from serious threats and that social workers should have a duty to protect children from domestic violence when they are on notice that such violence will occur. Above all, Glendon fears that judicial decisions that fail to recognize these duties have harmed public discourse and social understandings. The important point is the general one: Critics of rights argue that the emphasis on rights diminishes individual commitments to duty and responsibility. 
In this section, I attempt to clarify some of the conceptual issues at stake in the critique of rights. I suggest as well that the 40 Id. at 516. 41 Id. at 517. 42 GLENDON, supra note 1, at 76-108. 43 Id. at 78-89. 
44 See DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep't of Social Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 196 (1989) (The Due Process Clause "confers no affirmative right to governmental aid, even where such aid may be necessary to secure life."). critique embodies some limited and partial (and important) truths, but that it does not by any means support a general challenge to rights.45 The critics of rights have, in short, misconceived their target. 
Definitional Issues 
Begin with a definition of rights. This is a regrettably complex issue, and I will have to deal with it briefly and tentatively here." Sometimes the term "rights" is intended to refer to important human interests, or (what is not the same thing) to those interests that operate as "trumps" in the sense that they cannot be compromised by reference to collective policies or goals. If we identify rights with important human interests, the critique of rights loses its force. Who could object to social protection of important human interests? 
The conception of rights as interests that operate as "trumps" against the collectivity raises more difficulty, largely because it is not clear that this conception is really helpful. The first problem is that almost every right is defeasible at some point, and defeasible just because the collective interest is very strong. In American law, no right is absolute. If, for example, the rest of the human race will be eliminated because of the protection of a right, the right will certainly be redefined or legitimately infringed, probably under some version of the "compelling interest" test. The real question then becomes when rights are defeasible because of collective justifications-under what conditions and for what reasons. The formula of "trumps" is misleading for this reason. We need to know what sorts of reasons are admissible and how weighty they must be; these are the key questions in the exploration of rights. 
Rights characteristically limit the kinds of arguments that can be used by way of justification, and they characteristically require justifications of special weight.47 Above all, rights exclude certain 45 For similar assessments, see McClain, supra note 1, at 990-94. 
46 For an especially instructive discussion of the definition of rights, see RAZ, supra note 13, at 165-92. 
47 See Richard H. Pildes, Avoiding Reasons: Exclusionary Reasons in Constitutional Law, 45 HASrINGS LJ. 711 (1994); Cass R. Sunstein, Incommensurability and Valuation in Law, 92 MICH. L. REV. 779 (1994). Note that it is important to inquire into two different dimensions-legitimacy and weight. Some grounds for infringing on rights are inadmissible even if they are weighty. Thus, racial prejudice is not a legitimate reason for racial discrimination, and offense at the content of ideas is not a legitimate reason for infringing on free speech. otherwise admissible reasons for action. 8 But ideas of this kind do not support the "trumps" metaphor and indeed lead in quite different directions. 
The second problem is that. many conceptual puzzles are raised by the understanding of rights as interests operating "against" the collectivity. Often rights are something that the collectivity recognizes and protects in order to protect its interests. If this is so, there is no easy opposition between rights and the collectivity. In fact many rights are best understood as a solution to a collective action problem and especially to a prisoner's dilemma faced by people lacking legal entitlements; property rights themselves have this character. 9 Rights are collectively conferred and designed to promote collective interests. They are protected by social institutions for social reasons. In such cases, rights may in a sense operate against the collectivity once they are conferred; government may not take property just because it wants to do so. But even in such cases, rights are guaranteed in the first instance both by and for the collectivity (which of course has no existence apart from the individuals who compose it). 
In any case, many people who are insistent on rights do not see rights as opposing the collectivity, at least not in any simple sense. Rights often have the purpose of creating a certain kind of society. Consider here Joseph Raz's suggestion: 
If I were to choose between living in a society which enjoys freedom of expression, but not having the right myself, or enjoying the right in a society which does not have it, I would have no hesitation in judging that my own personal interest is better served by the first option." The point suggests that many rights deserve to exist because of their collective consequences. 
This idea can be embraced by people from diverse perspectives; I offer some truncated remarks. Utilitarians would be likely to make a large space for rights, because the protection of identified interests as rights can promote utility. There is no tension between utilitarianism and rights, though the utilitarian account of rights is distinctive and controversial.5 Economic analysts of law 48 See the discussion of exclusionary reasons in JOSEPH RAz, PRACTICAL REASON AND NORMS 35-48 (2d ed. 1992). 
49 See COLEMAN, supra note 14, at 3. 
50 JOSEPH RAZ, Rights and Individual Well-Being, in ETHICS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN: ESSAYS IN THE MORALrIY OF LAW AND POLITICS 29, 39 (1994). 
51 SeeJONATHAN RILEY, LIBERAL UTILITARIANISM 150-80 (1988); see also RAZ, supra note are hardly critical of rights. On the contrary, they take rights to be crucial instruments for promoting economic goals. 2 Those who emphasize the need to base social and legal practices on a conception of the human good, or of human flourishing, will also make room for rights insofar as rights can be shown to be a method of promoting human flourishing. Under this view, a conception of the good is prior to a conception of the right; but rights are a crucial part of the good, or a crucial way of achieving the good, for purposes of both theory and practice. 
Some people associate rights with "nature."54 The natural rights tradition is, to say the least, a complex one, and I cannot sort out its various claims here. But some of those who point to "nature" should probably be understood to say that certain distinctly human characteristics and capacities call for or fit with a certain category of rights. If social and legal practices must be based on the natural capacities of human beings, we might be led to embrace a set of rights that promote those capacities.5 Perhaps people who espouse this view will see natural rights as worthy of respect whatever the particular community may think. That claim may be correct, but it does not oppose rights in any simple sense to the collectivity. Many of the rights sought by the natural law tradition have everything to do with sociality and its preconditions.-5 
Of course deontological writers offer a very different conception of rights, seeing them not as instruments for maximizing utility or wealth, or as a way of promoting the best conception of the human good, but as reflecting respect for individuals as persons.57 Here we may indeed have an opposition between the individual and the community. Under this conception of rights, it remains necessary to justify any particular understanding of rights, and thus to offer reasons for their existence. But perhaps those 50, at 32 (criticizing the utilitarian account of rights); Amartya Sen, Rights and Agency, 11 PHIL. & PUB. A. 3 (1982). 
52 See, e.g., RICHARD A. POSNER, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF LAw 1-15 (4th ed. 1992). 53 See, e.g., AMARiYA SEN, INEQUALITY REEXAMINED 44-58 (1992); Martha Nussbaum, Aristotelian Social Democracy, in LIBERALISM AND THE GOOD 228-240 (R. Bruce Douglass et al. eds., 1984). 
54 See, e.g., JOHN FINNIS, NATURAL LAW AND NATURAL RIGHTS (1988). 55 This conception of rights emerges from id. 56 See id. 
57 See, e.g., DWORKIN, supra note 20, at 212. An important claim for duties rather than rights emerges from ONORA O'NEILL, CONSTRUCTIONS OF REASON: EXPLORATIONS OF KANT'S PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY (1989). reasons need not refer to collective goals. On the other hand, some (broadly speaking) deontological writers do insist on the collective goals that underlie rights, suggesting that rights have their origin in such goals."8 
Let us put these conceptual difficulties to one side and define rights in a way that should be congenial to both supporters and critics of rights: Rights are legally enforceable instruments for the protection of their claimants. Rights are thus practical instruments that can be invoked in courts of law by individuals or groups against both private parties and the state. (To say that rights operate against society is not to say that their justification is not social. Rights operating, against society may have social justification; consider the right to free speech or the right to private property.) This is a highly pragmatic conception of rights, one that tries to put philosophical issues to one side and to identify instead the actual functions of rights in the world. I think that it is this understanding of rights, and not the contested theoretical issues, that underlies the critique of rights. 
B. Republicanism, Liberalism, and Rights 
Now shift to the place of rights in American constitutionalism. A good deal of work in constitutional law has dealt with the role of "republican" thought in the American tradition." The republican ideal prizes a deliberative conception of democracy-one in which popular sovereignty entails not simple majoritarianism, but an effort to ensure a form of reason-giving in the public sphiere. ° Efforts to revive the republican tradition have been designed in part to oppose the view that the protection of antecedently given "rights" is the sole purpose of the American constitutional tradition. On the contrary, the notion that rights are antecedently given leads to real confusion. Many rights are protected as such because they are a precondition for democratic deliberation," and in any case the American constitutional order seeks deliberation about ordinary issues not implicating rights at all. 
Some people think that liberalism and republicanism are at odds' and that rights have a natural place in liberalism but an awkward one in republican thought. But there is no opposition between the liberal tradition and the republican tradition as these have operated in the United States; and republicanism is hardly hostile to rights. To be sure, we could generate conceptions of republicanism that are opposed to liberalism, and vice versa. A conception of republicanism that distrusts rights altogether, or that sees duty to the community as an overriding obligation of all citizens,63 or that seeks to impose a unitary conception of the good, would indeed be antiliberal. Moreover, a conception of liberalism that sees politics as an effort to aggregate private preferences would indeed be antirepublican, since it would place no premium on deliberation or civic virtue. But the aspiration to deliberative democracy can certainly be understood in such a way as to be both liberal and republican. The liberal tradition is committed to the justification of government outcomes by reference to reasons64 and also to a form of government by discussion.' 
Some critics of the "republican revival" think that republicanism and rights are at odds. On this view, republicanism is "ominous" insofar as it prizes democratic deliberation and downgrades private rights.' But this is a misreading of the republican tradition. The Framers of the Constitution were certainly republicans, and they certainly believed in rights. Modern forms of republicanism are enthusiastic about rights. If deliberation and citizenship are desirable, rights of free speech, for example, seem indispensable, and we may be led to guarantee rights of religious liberty,67 rights of private property, and rights in the criminal justice sys62 See, e.g., Morton J. Horwitz, Republicanism and Liberalism in American Constitutional Thought, 29 WM. & MARY L. REV. 57 (1987). 
63 See Sunstein, supra note 59, at 40 n.51 (discussing Benjamin Rush's proposal for teaching each citizen "that he does not belong to himself, but that he is public property"). 
64 See the discussion of public reason in JOHN RAWLS, POLrIcAL LIBERALISM 216-20 (1993). 
65 See SAMUEL H. BEER, To MAKE A NATION: THE REDISCOVERY OF AMERICAN FEDERAuSM (1993). 
66 See Martin H. Redish & Gary Lippman, Freedom of Expression and the Civic Republican Revival in Constitutional Theory: The Ominous Implications, 79 CAL. L. REV. 267 (1991). 
67 See Stephen Holmes, Precommitment and the Paradox of Democracy, in CONSTITUTIONALISM AND DEMOCRACY 195 (Jon Elster & Rune Slagstad eds., 1988). tem-and also to protect the rule of law, a constraint on government power that seems a precondition for citizenship.s 
Of course a commitment to republicanism-a vagu6 and general creed capable of many diverse specifications-does not lead to any particular constellation of rights. But republicans are likely to make much use of rights to promote their own deepest ideals. 
From the previous discussion we can see a wide range of strands in the challenge to rights. The challenge is highly eclectic. Moreover, there are some truths in many of these points, and it will be useful to explore those truths. 
Of course rights do depend for their existence on collective institutions. As we know them, rights require public protection and support.69 Protection of the individual-of property or person-cannot easily occur without collective help." But this descriptive point is hardly an argument against rights. Many good things depend for their existence on collective institutions, and this is not an argument that those things are bad. Economic prosperity, a pluralistic culture, sufficient quantities of nutrition, housing for all or most, freedom from violence, racial equality, low rates of unemployment-all these are, under imaginable conditions, secured best or only with collective help. They are no less desirable for that." 
It is also important to point out that references to rights can make for unduly rigid understandings of complex problems and can sometimes stop discussion in its tracks before analysis has even started. Claims of right often have the vices of rules. Even worse, rights can be conclusions masquerading as reasons. In thinking about claims of right, it is often necessary to be detailed and concrete about the social consequences of competing courses of action. The invocation of "rights" can be a serious obstacle to this process. Consider, for example, the current debates over regulation of the electronic media, violent pornography, hate speech at universities, or advertising for cigarettes. To say that any restriction on these forms of expression violates the "right to free speech" may in the end be correct; but this requires a long and complex argument, not a shorthand phrase. The claim of a "right to free speech" is far too general and abstract to support the argument. Here it does seem important and true to say that rights, stated abstractly, do not solve concrete cases. They are indeterminate until they are specified. 
As they operate in law, rights generally are specified. Hence the rights protected by the Constitution and the common law are far from indeterminate, however hard it is to know what they are when stated abstractly. The claim of indeterminacy is for this reason far too broad. The problem, to which the critics have correctly drawn attention, lies in the use of general claims of right to resolve cases in which the specification has not yet occurred. 
It is also true that efforts to think about many social and economic problems in terms of rights can obscure those problems. A claimed right to clean air and water or to safe products and workplaces makes little sense in light of the need for close assessment, in particular cases, of the advantages of greater environmental protection or more safety, as compared with the possible accompanying disadvantages-higher prices, lower wages, less employment, and more poverty. Perhaps the legal system will create rights of a kind after it has undertaken this assessment. But to the extent that the regulatory programs of the 1970s were billed as simple vindications of "rights," they severely impaired political deliberation about their content and about the necessity for tradeoffs.72 
It seems correct too to say that civic virtue-responsibility to one's neighbors and to one's nation-is an important part of 72 I attempt to defend this claim in SUNSTEIN, supra note 10, at 74-110. citizenship. This is an aspect of citizenship that is notoriously neglected in public discussion and social practice. Whether rights are the culprit here may be questioned. But insofar as rights are understood in purely self-iAterested terms, it is certainly conceivable that they can crowd out issues of responsibility. 
Nor should it be denied that rights, can protect existing distributions and practices. Many rights, particularly those associated with the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, have been so understood for many years.7' But this is hardly a challenge to rights. Whether rights do have this function depends not on their status as rights but on what, particularly, rights are. And whether rights should protect existing distributions 'and practices cannot be decided in the abstract. Such protection is not always a bad idea. Whether it is justified depends on the appropriate weight to be given to the interests in stability and expectations, and on the merits of those distributions and practices. This is a complex matter that cannot be resolved a priori. 
D. Confusions and Misconceptions 
Despite the various partial truths in the attack on rights, there is a pervasive problem in that attack: Rights need not have the functions or consequences that they are alleged to have. The challenge to rights is properly directed against certain kinds of rights, not against rights in general. At most, the challenge to rights creates a contingent, partial warning about the appropriate content of rights and about the possibly harmful role of certain social institutions safeguarding rights. It is not what it purports to be, that is, a general claim about rights as a social institution. More specifically, the current devaluation of rights suffers from two serious problems. Both of these problems are products of some pervasive confusions. 
Many critics of rights complain about what they see as a cultural shift from the 1960s, in which rights have crowded out responsibilities.74 Simply as a matter of cultural description, the claim is far too crude. In some areas, including for example sexuality, it is plausible to say that a belief in private autonomy has prevailed at the expense of a commitment to responsible behavior. But in other areas, the last few decades have witnessed an increase in social and legal responsibilities and a decreased commitment to rights. Consider, for example, cigarette smoking; corporate misconduct; air and water pollution; sexual harassment; and racist and sexist speech. In all of these areas, people who were formerly autonomous, and free to act in accordance with their own claims of right, are now subject to socially and sometimes legally enforced responsibilities. We have seen, in the last few decades, a redefinition of areas of right and a redefinition of areas of responsibility. I do not intend to celebrate these redefinitions, but only to suggest that purely as a matter of description, there has been no general shift from responsibility to rights. 
Now turn from description to evaluation. The first problem is that whether rights are associated with excessive individualism, with excessive self-interest, or with anything else that is excessive depends on what rights specifically are. It should go without saying that rights are designed to protect human beings,75 each of whom is an individual; but this cannot be a complaint of the critics of rights. Instead, many such critics seem to object that rights are associated with pernicious forms of individualism and self-interestedness. But this is not the case. To take two examples, the right to subsistence and the right to environmental quality-whether or not these should be codified in law-do not seem to promote selfishness. Both rights might be products of altruism, and may promote altruism and even feelings of responsibility. In fact many rights are designed to encourage precisely the forms of deliberation and communal interaction that critics favor. A wide range of protected interests count as "rights," and the critics fail to make some important distinctions among diverse legal instruments. 
The second problem is that the critics seem to think that the explosion of "rights talk" accounts for certain social failures, including failures of social responsibility. This is far too simple a claim. In fact, the opposite is as likely true-failures of social responsibility give rise to assertions of rights. In any case, the claimed association depends on empirical claims that are highly speculative and that lack clear support. 
75 I mean to put to one side and not to assess the question whether nonhuman creatures or objects should have rights, for the ultimate protection of human beings or for other reasons. 
The two problems can be brought together if we attend to a familiar conceptual confusion. 6 Often critics write as if rights and responsibilities are opposed, or as if those who favor the former are completely different from those who favor the latter. As they see it, rights are individual, atomistic, selfish, crude, licentious, antisocial, and associated with the Warren Court. Responsibilities, on the other hand, are seen as collective, social, altruistic, nuanced, and associated with appropriate or traditional values. But this understanding is quite inadequate, for some rights lack the characteristics claimed for them, and other rights have the features associated with responsibilities."' 
For example, the right to freedom of speech may be owned by individuals, but it is a precondition for a highly social process, that of democratic deliberation. That right keeps open the channels of communication; it is emphatically communal in character. It ensures a sine quo non of sociality, an opportunity for people to speak with one other. Indeed, everyone who owns a speech right does so partly so as to contribute to the collectivity; it is this fact that explains the government's inability to "buy" speech rights even when a speaker would like to sell.7' So too, the right to associational freedom is hardly individualistic. It is meant precisely to protect collective' action and sociality. 
Consider another time-honored liberal right, the right to a jury trial. This right is far from atomistic. Quite the contrary, it ensures a role for the community in adjudicative proceedings.79 The right to religious liberty protects individuals (surely this does not count against the right), but it is also designed to protect the collectivity by ensuring social peace and thus by making democracy possible."0 The right to vote, also owned by individuals, protects 76 A related confusion is embodied in the notion that rights posit a wholly autonomous, asocial "subject." Rights do no such thing. They are political instruments with no necessary metaphysical foundation. 
77 See, e.g., Akhil R. Amar, The Bill of Rights As A Constitution, 100 YALE LJ. 1131, 1201-10 (1991) (discussing the nonatomistic character of most rights at the founding period). 
78 See, e.g., Cass R. Sunstein, Government Control of Information, 79 CAL. L. REV. 889, 914-16 (1986). 
79 See Amar, supra note 77, at 1182-99. 
80 See Stephen Holmes, Gag Rules or the Politics of Omission, in CONSTITUTIONALISM AND DEMOCRACY 19 (ion Elster & Rune Slagstad eds., 1988). Indeed, Glendon's discussion comes close to an argument not only for a new duty, but also for a new right: a right to assistance, to be granted to vulnerable people and held by them against both other people and the government. Glendon herself refers to Franklin Roosevelt's proposed "second bill of rights," which included the right to adequate food and clothing, to a decent home, to adequate medical care, to good education, and to a useful and remunerative job. 4 Of course these are rights and their invocation represents a form of "rights talk," but they certainly and emphatically reflect a sense of collective responsibility.' They are not associated with self-interest, or at least not (in any simple sense) with the self-interest of those who must respect them. 
It is perfectly possible that any such second bill of rights would be a bad idea. That is not my point. No one should deny that the proliferation of rights may be unfortunate or worse; too many rights may even contradict one another. The new Eastern European Constitutions are an unfortunate illustration." I am not attempting to defend any particular system or set of rights, but instead suggesting something far simpler: Since rights tend to imply responsibilities simply as a matter of logic, and vice versa, it is not easy to understand the claim that American law needs responsibilities rather than or in addition to rights. 
The claimed opposition between rights and responsibilities faces some additional difficulties as well. Rights of the most traditional sort, including property, may be the necessary condition for enabling a sense of collective responsibility to flourish. People without rights to their property may be so dependent on official will that they cannot exercise their responsibilities as citizens. Moreover, a principal characteristic of totalitarian states is the endless cataloguing of responsibilities owed by citizens to the state. The Soviet Constitution was an ignoble example. For example, that Constitution created a duty "to make thrifty use of the 84 President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Message to Congress on the State of the Union (Jan. 11, 1944), in 13 THE PUBLIC PAPERS AND ADDRESSES OF FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT 32, 41 (Samuel I. Rosenman ed., 1969); see also GLENDON, supra note 1, at 104. 
85 The suggestion that responsibility should be exercised instead of legal compulsion is taken up in Part III infra. 
86 See Cass R. Sunstein, Something 014 Something New, E. EuR. CONST. REv., Spring 1992, at 18. people's wealth,""7 "to preserve and protect socialist property,"' to "work conscientiously,"9 and "to concern themselves with the upbringing of children."9 The Soviet Constitution offers a cautionary note against enthusiasm for responsibilities, at least if these are to be treated as an explicit, legally codified concern of the state (putting the Hohfeldian point to one side)." 
These points suggest a broad conclusion about the recent criticism of rights. Those who believe in more reflective public deliberation are making an important point; we have far too little such deliberation, and part of the problem involves unduly simple arguments based on alleged rights. But the critics should not claim to be making so general a criticism of rights. Instead, they should offer a fine-grained account allowing people to identify both the sorts of interests that cannot be intruded on without special justification and the sorts of institutions that should protect various interests. Surely such an inquiry will justify a redescription of certain interests in terms that have nothing to do with rights or that treats rights not as axiomatic but as the outcomes of a complex set of judgments. For example, consider the problems of environmental protection and plant closings. 2 But it is equally certain that many "rights" will survive in their current state. 
It is important to insist that such an inquiry will suggest that the category of human rights is not coextensive with the category of constitutional rights or the category of judicially enforceable rights. Constitutional rights qualify as such for special and partly contingent reasons, having to do with institutional issues and with the reasons for distrust of ordinary politics in the particular nation.9" Constitutional rights are usually and rightly thought to have a "vertical" dimension, allocating power between the government and the individual. But they also have an important "horizontal" dimension, allocating power among different branches of government by, for example, granting authority to the judiciary 87 Id. (Article 61). 88 Id. 89 Id. (Article 60). 90 Id. (Article 65). 91 See id. at 18-19. 92 See GLENDON, supra note 1, at 29-30, 111-12. 
93 See Cass R. Sunstein, Liberal Constitutionalism and Liberal Justice, 72 TEx. L. REv. 305 (1993). that might otherwise be exercised by the legislature. The horizontal allocation requires some justification in terms of the different capacities of different institutions. 
Many critics are speaking to the issue of institutional character, complaining about courts, not about rights.94 But there is often a solid justification for a constitutional and also judicial role in the protection of rights. Under plausible assumptions, the institution of constitutional rights will survive as an invaluable one, especially to the extent that such rights can safeguard interests that are at excessive risk in ordinary politics. It is also likely, in many imaginable situations, that the institution of judicial review will survive as well.95 Many prominent critics of judicial review are making conceivably but only contingently convincing empirical claims about the likely inclinations and character of judges." They are not doing what they purport to be doing, that is, showing a general incompatibility between judicially vindicated constitutional rights and democracy. Often such rights promote democracy, and are not antithetical to it.97 The 'attack on an excessive judicial role should be separated from the attack on rights as such. 
Perhaps these basic arguments would not entirely satisfy many critics of rights. Perhaps they would want to characterize the problem as the constant resort to the legal system as a remedy for social ills, rather than the use of public deliberative processes and, best of all, of self-help and nongovernmental institutions. In the last generation we have seen quite absurd claims of right in cases involving the law of tort and the law of the Constitution. Is it unconstitutional-invasive of right-for government to require people to wear helmets when they ride motorcycles?" Many people think that such questions are rhetorical and that such cases give rights a bad name. 
94 See, e.g., WALDRON, supra note 81. 
95 There is of course a difference between constitutional rights and judicially enforceable constitutional rights; some constitutional rights might be enforceable only through politics. 
96 See WALDRON, supra note 81. 97 The classic statement is JOHN HART ELY, DEMOCRAcY AND DISTRUST (1980). 98 See, e.g., Picou v. Gillum, 874 F.2d 1519 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 920 (1989). 
It may therefore be the peculiar interaction between American individualism, American law, and "rights talk," rather than rights themselves, with which critics are most concerned. On this view, the problem is not so much rights in general, but rights claims that deny obligations to others, that ignore the possibility that private actors can and should take care of themselves, and that are associated with immaturity, personal self-interest, hedonism, and the short term. To the extent that the critics seek to revive a richer and more differentiated kind of public debate and to emphasize the need for greater attention to the possibilities and obligations of private organizations, they are entirely persuasive. The mind-numbingly familiar oppositions of matched legalistic rights-pro-life versus pro-choice, associational freedom versus nondiscrimination, business autonomy versus employment rights-are part of the culture of the soundbite, which provides no help to those seeking to think through or to assist people with complex realities. 
But it is important to sort out the relationships between "rights talk" and "the impoverishment of political discourse. "' Some critics suggest that political discourse is in significant part a creature of what happens with courts and law."0 But this is an empirical claim, and it may not be true. To be sure, political discourse is often impoverished, and correctives for the current situation should be a principal concern of current reformers. This is a central issue for modern democracies. If one looks at the prominent places for political discussion-say, the television and most popular radio stations-one will find little deliberation and little serious attention to public issues, and such attention as there is appears sensationalistic, prurient, sentimental, and banal.' Sometimes the banality consists of reflexive claims about rights. 
Important questions, however, remain: To what extent can this phenomenon be attributed to "rights talk" within the judiciary and the legal system? By what mechanism has "rights talk" produced problems in public deliberation? Can an association be shown? Careful work has shown that many arguments about the social effects of judicial decisions tend to be overstated, specula99 GLENDON, supra note 1, at x. 100 See, e.g., id. at 87, 105. 
101 See, e.g., GASS R. SUNSTEIN, DEMOCRACY AND THE PROBLEM OF FREE SPEECH (1993). For a helpful discussion of American traditions in this respect, see JOSEPH M. BESSETrE, THE MILD VOICE OF REASON 1-39 (1994). tive, or without much support. 11 2 The current situation-of inadequate democratic deliberation-is not clearly traceable to judicial protection of rights. On the contrary, it is far more plausibly a product of the system of education and the demands of the broadcasting market."° If the critics' concern is with impoverished political discourse, they might focus on the incentives, norms, and practices of those who impart political information-on their responsibilities, and on the legal framework, or rights, under which they undertake those responsibilities. 
There is enormous room for reform here, drawing on experience in other nations and involving changes both in private sector practices and in the regulatory system governing the media.",4 For example, the government might offer larger subsidies to high quality broadcasting or encourage more attention to public issues through licensing policies. It might offer guidelines or recommendations designed to work against the culture of the soundbite. It might attempt to encourage opinion polls that involve public deliberation rather than quick and often ill-considered individual reactions." 5 All this seems plausible. What I am questioning is the suggestion that "rights" are a major culprit here. On the contrary, rights of some sort are likely to be an important part of any effort to improve public deliberation. 
I have suggested that many of the most enthusiastic and vivid challenges to rights are based on the idea that the American emphasis on rights, and perhaps especially on legal rights, has caused a weakened sense of social responsibility. The Hohfeldian point-that rights impose responsibilities, while responsibilities create rights-severely complicates this idea. But putting that point to one side, we should acknowledge that an insistence on people's rights ought not to disparage people's responsibilities. This idea could perhaps qualify as a twenty-first-century analogue to the Ninth Amendment.' Certainly we should keep in mind the important point that people may have a right to do something that 102 See generally GERALD N. ROSENBERG, THE HOLLOW HOPE (1990). 103 See C. EDWIN BAKER, ADVERTISING AND A DEMOCRATIC PRESS 44-82 (1994). 104 See id. at 80-82. 105 SeeJAMES FISHKIN, DEMOCRACY AND DELIBERATION (1991). 
106 "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." U.S. CONST. amend. IX. they would be irresponsible to do. Or to put things another way, it may be very wrong to exercise one's rights. 
Indeed, it is unquestionably objectionable to engage in much conduct that one has a right to do. Some platitudes are worth repeating: We may have a right to say offensive things, even grotesquely offensive things, but most people do not and should not exercise that right very often. People may have a right to treat each other in many disrespectful ways, but disrespectful treatment is not for that reason acceptable. An extremely wealthy person has a right to keep all his money (after taxes), and to give none of it to charity, but selfishness and hoarding are not to be applauded. A lawyer has a right to refuse to do pro bono work, but lawyers should generally do pro bono work. 
The point bears particularly on the controversial issues of pregnancy and abortion. Under the Constitution, women have a right to have abortions. But it is important to insist that this is a right that ought not to be exercised, or to have to be exercised, very often, and that in a society with 1.5 million abortions per year, something is extremely wrong. Even people who favor the abortion right ought to be clear that an abortion is a tragic event and that steps should be taken to make abortions rare. In the aftermath of the Supreme Court's refusal to overrule Roe v. Wade,"7 it is perfectly appropriate for people on all sides of the issue to shift public debate in the direction of ways to minimize the incidence of abortion. Efforts to discourage pregnancies that will result in abortions, and even to discourage abortion itself through moral suasion, should not, as a general rule, be taken as unfortunate interferences with a "right," even if some such efforts might be rejected as punitive or discriminatory. 
However we may think about this heated subject, the example demonstrates the basic point that a nation ought not to say that because people have a legal right to do something, society and its various components have no business complaining about people who exercise that right, or engaging in moral disapproval of people who do what they have a right to do. On the contrary, a large part of moral education consists of the inculcation of norms and values that discourage harmful or offensive behavior even though it is not unlawful. One possible pathology of a culture of rights is that people will think that because they have a right to do X, they cannot be criticized or blamed for doing X. This conclusion ap107 See Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 112 S. Ct. 2791 (1992). pears to have become common with respect to free speech, where speakers sometimes complain that it is objectionable even to challenge them for engaging in offensive or degrading speech.0"8 A well-functioning' culture distinguishes legal censure from moral censure. It allows people the freedom to do many things that are properly criticized on moral grounds. 
The point bears on recent claims by Justice Thomas and other critics of rights. Justice Thomas is concerned that an emphasis on what people have a right to do has produced a kind of moral relativism and standardlessness where right-holders insist on their rights and do not pause to evaluate whether their conduct is valuable to themselves or to society. Justice Thomas is particularly troubled that the grant of rights can make people, and especially disadvantaged people, think of themselves as victims, whose basic goal is to assert their claims and to seek protection from government. On this view, the recognition of rights can generate forms of dependency, self-pity, and lack of initiative that are extremely damaging to rights-holders themselves. Ideas of this sort have also played a role in recent arguments, sometimes made by self-proclaimed feminists countering certain prominent feminist claims-with the critics urging that the emphasis on, for example, rights against sexual harassment and pornography has encouraged women to join a cult of victimhood, in which equality and self-respect become all the more difficult to obtain. 109 
The fear of an association between the recognition of legal rights and failures in responsibility and self-help seems plausible in many settings. People who lack rights to desirable goods may-from fear, self-interest, or sheer desperation-engage in socially productive conduct. (Of course they may engage in unproductive and even dangerous conduct instead.) For example, there is a familiar and wholly reasonable fear that a "right to welfare" could discourage productive labor. It is possible too that people who think of themselves as victims, needing and enforcing rights, will fail to engage in activity that is ultimately rewarding to themselves and to society as a whole. 
108 For example, some people have claimed "censorship" in response to Senator Paul Simon's attempts to monitor televised violence. See, e.g., Raymond L. Fischer, Is It Possible to Regulate Television Violence?, USA TODAY, July, 1994 (Magazine), at 72 (describing the ACLU's position that "violent speech has been protected by the First Amendment for more than 50 years" and media organizations' opposition to the "momentum building in Washington for censorship as a solution to violence"). 
109 See SOMMERS, supra note 1; STROSSEN, supra note 24, at 119-40, 179-215. [VCol. 70:4 
These claims are, however, empirical ones, and they are quite speculative. They cannot be credited in the abstract. Whether they are true, and in what settings they are true, requires much more work than has been supplied thus far. Indeed, the converse phenomenon may occur, with recipients of rights conceiving of themselves as anything but victims and helpless. Perhaps people who are given rights-to own property, to be free from segregation, to be free from sexual harassment-will be more likely to conceive of themselves as receiving and deserving equal respect. It is surely plausible that the recognition of rights often converts people from victims into citizens. Certainly a major point of rights guarantee is to do precisely this. 
In an important respect, moreover, the critique of rights in favor of responsibilities seems to have things backward. Rights claims are often a response to a failure of social responsibility rather than a cause of individual irresponsibility. We might look again at the abortion problem, which, for many, exemplifies the hazards of rights-based approaches." ° To be sure, it does seem inadequate to think of abortion in terms of a right to "privacy"-a word that does not appear in the Constitution at all and that in any case fails to come to grips with the abortion question. To oppose the abstract "right to life" to the equally abstract "right to choose" is entirely unhelpful. As many people have suggested, a social goal might be not to protect an abstract right to choose, but instead to develop methods to protect unborn life while simultaneously providing help and support for mothers.' 
If we acknowledge all this, how, if at all, might the abortion right be justified? The answer has everything tq do with social context and with failures of social responsibility. Under conditions of equality on the basis of sex and without. widespread poverty, the argument for an abortion right would be far weaker."2 Surely it is correct to say that in a society in which duties to the vulnerable were taken seriously, the case for a right to abortion would be much less plausible than it now is. In such a society, men as well as women would be required (by social norms and perhaps by 110 See, e.g., GLENDON, supra note 1, at 58-66, 164-68. 
111 See, e.g., MARY ANN GLENDON, ABORTION AND DIVORCE IN WESTERN LAW (1987); Michael W. McConnell, Religion and the Search for a Principled Middle Ground on Abortion, 92 MICH. L. REv. 1893 (1994) (reviewing ELIZABETH MENSCH & ALAN FREEMAN, THE POLITICS OF VIRTUE: Is ABORTION DEBATABLE? (1993)). 
112 This is one lesson of Glendon's work, though it is not a lesson that Glendon draws herself. See GLENDON, supra note 111. law) to devote their bodies to the protection of their children. In such a society, women who need help would get help-before, during, and after pregnancy." In such a society, the existence of social assistance would argue against the right to abortion, by making child-bearing and child-rearing less difficult and less a source of inequality than it now is for many women. 
Most important, in such a society restrictions on abortion would be based on a general and neutral form of compassion for the vulnerable, rather than the now pervasive desire-prominent, though (I emphasize) by no means universal, in the pro-life movement-to control women's reproductive capacities, and by means of that control to prescribe traditional gender rules through law, and in that way to continue a system of discrimination that is based on sex. 
I have described a society in which any right to abortion might seem puzzling or even unnecessary. This is not, of course, the society in which we live. If one looks at the context in which restrictions on abortion take place-at their real purposes and their real effects-the abortion right is most plausibly rooted not in privacy but in the right to equality on the basis of sex. I cannot fully support the claim here," 4 but a few points, bearing on the nature of rights claims in general, may be suggestive. 
Current law does not compel men to devote their bodies to the protection of other people, even if life is at stake, and even if men are responsible for the very existence of those people. Many studies have shown that current restrictions on abortion could not be enacted without the active support of those who believe that such restrictions are an important means of reasserting traditional gender roles."- Of course such support is not barred by any legitimate theory of democracy, but it suggests that the relevant laws are in fact founded in significant part (though certainly not universally) in prejudice. And under current conditions, women who need social assistance or (at least equally important) help from fathers do not get nearly enough-not merely during pregnancy, but before and after as well. 
If this is the case, the very existence of the abortion right can be seen as a response to a failure of social responsibility. The 113 See id. at 53-58 (discussing the European practice of care for pregnant women). 114 See SUNSrEJN, supra note 60, at 270-85, for a more complete discussion of this claim. 
115 See, e.g., KRISTEN LUKER, ABORTION AND THE POLITICS OF MOTHERHOOD (1984). right cannot be justified in the abstract-its existence owes everything to context. In this lies a large lesson. Rights often emerge precisely because of the refusal of private and public institutions to recognize and to carry out their duties. When the environment is badly degraded, when the most vulnerable people are left to fend for themselves, or when children are at risk, it should be unsurprising to find vigorous if apparently odd claims for "rights." The claims for a right to clean air and water, to food, to a decent place to live, to a safe workplace, to children's rights, or to "free reproductive choice'"-all these must be understood in their context, as responses to failures of social responsibility. 
Critics of rights are sometimes persuasive in asserting that rights-based arguments can obscure the problems at hand. It is very plausible to think that vulnerable people should not have a legally enforceable right to freedom from everything to which they are vulnerable, in part because such a right could impair responsibility. It is very plausible to think that instead of emphasizing a right to abortion, we should alter the social conditions that make abortion attractive or necessary. Arguments on behalf of rights can simplify complex issues, beg important questions, and treat issues involving trade-offs among competing goals as soluble through easy formulas. But it would be unfortunate if plausible objections to rights-based thinking were taken as a reason to ignore or to disparage those who are proclaiming their rights, rather than to improve the conditions that have made it necessary for people to resort to proclamations of rights in the first place. 
CONCLUSION 
There have been many different strands in recent critiques of rights. Some of those strands point to legitimate concerns. We can identify rights claims that are genuinely absurd, and it is important to acknowledge that a society pervaded by rights may be pathological. My basic point here is that the category of rights is extremely broad and that for this reason, no general critique of rights will make much sense. Those who blame "rights" have misdescribed their real target. In the last generation, morever, there has been no general shift from responsibilities to rights. Instead there have been multiple particular shifts in both directions. 
Some rights are a precondition for social interaction. Rights are not opposed to responsibilities, at least not in any simple way; rights are responsibilities. Rights need not be associated with excessive self-interest or excessive individualism. The real question is not whether we should have rights, but what rights we should have. Some of what I have discussed here bears on that question, but to make much progress on it, much more will have to be said about both values and facts. I conclude with the suggestion that we should cease discussing -whether rights are desirable and cease opposing rights to responsibilities. We should embark instead on the more fine-grained task of deciding what categories of rights are appropriate in what settings.

Lecture 
By Cass R. Sunstein" 
I have some stories for you to begin. I spend summers on the east end of Long Island (near the recent fire) because my in-laws are there. There are many interesting things that one could notice in the Hamptons. One thing that is noticeable in the last few years is the change from the East Hampton dump to the East Hampton Recycling Center. When in late August I went there to throw out and separate my garbage, what I saw was extremely fancy cars-BMW's and Mercedes; there was one Rolls Royce-people with informal but extremely expensive clothes patiently separating their garbage, making sure the green glass was different from the white glass and that the newspapers were all sorted, spending a lot of time at the East Hampton Recycling Center. And they looked happy. 
The second story comes from my old boss, Thurgood Marshall, * Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Jurisprudence, Law School and Department of Political Science, University of Chicago. This is a lightly edited version of a lecture delivered at Quinnipiac College School of Law in October 1995. Some of the issues are discussed in more detail in Social Norms and Social Rules, COLUM. L. REv. (forthcoming 1996, May). who is famous for arguing the Miranda case and for being a staunch defender of the outcome in Miranda. Once he thought Miranda was maybe going to be overruled by the Burger Court, he came to us and said, "You know, it would be bad, but Miranda isn't a big deal." He said, "If the police are going to beat people up they are going to beat people up. Miranda isn't crucial. I'll tell you how that stops." And he told a story about a chief of police getting together twenty-five of his officers and saying, "If anyone here beats anybody up, they're fired." Then he said with a big guffaw, "That's how you stop police misconduct." 
The third story has to do with teenage smoking, something which the President is very interested in reducing. The newspapers have suggested that there has been a large increase in teenage smoking, which isn't quite true. Among whites, teenage smoking now is about the same as it has been for the past fifteen years. Think of what might have happened, what would you expect would have happened in this period among African American teenagers? Well, here is the appropriate data. In 1965, thirty percent of African American teenagers smoked appropriate cigarettes. In 1987, the number had dropped to twenty percent. In 1993, the number was four point four percent. This is recognized by the Center for Disease Control as a terrific public health success story for which the Center of Disease Control has no explanation. I have a hunch about what explains it. And it's connected with a poster that appeared adjacent to a highway-in a billboard in Harlem, New York, a poster that was part of a private educational campaign by the African American community designed to reduce teenage smoking. The poster has a picture of the Marlboro man looking like a skeleton offering a cigarette to an African American child and saying, "First they had us pick it; now they want us to smoke it." Something very important has happened in that community with respect to teenage smoking. 
Only one more story, this has to do with economists. Economists are interested in figuring out how much environmental amenities are worth. One way they try to figure that out is they ask people how much they are willing to pay for environmental amenities. You might be asked how much you would be willing to pay to save a pond. Or how much would you be willing to pay to save the spotted owl, or how much would you be willing to pay to reduce a risk from .005% of you getting cancer to .0005% of getting cancer. Economists believe that if you ask someone how much would you be willing to spend for goods you should give the same amount as if you're asked how much would you have to be paid to have a reduction in the equivalent thing. There is an intuition that these numbers should be the same. It turns out that the economists have this equivalence as an axiom. But the equivalence doesn't hold. When people are asked how much would they be willing to pay to allow the extinction of a spotted owl, they will give a number. They're asked how much would they have to be paid, they give a higher number. In fact, much of the time they give an answer like, "I don't answer questions like that," or, "There is no number high enough," or, "What sort of a person do you think I am?" This is an anomaly. It's causing some havoc in the economics community. 
There's a unifying theme in the stories I've told, and that has to do with the pervasive effect of social norms on behavior. And I'm going to be discussing the relationship between social norms and law in the effort to make a partial defense of my not-currently-trendy thesis, that is a defense of big government. 
A defense of big government would have to have a lot of components. And I'm going to trace right now, very quickly, three of the components that I'm not going to spend much time on. One component in the defense of big government would start by reading the Contract of America and noting that sharp distinctions are drawn between markets on the one hand and government on the other. My suggestion would be there is no distinction between markets and government. Markets depend for their existence on government. We cannot have markets without government. In fact, we cannot have markets without taxing and spending. Markets depend for their existence on police, property law, contract law, tort law-an extensive state apparatus that can't get in motion without some taxing and some spending. The distinction-which is so dominant in popular debate right now-between markets and government is built on a conceptual error, that is the proposition that we could have markets without government. 
That's not a criticism of markets. It's an observation that markets depend on something like or close to big government. 
A full defense of big government would add to this point a list of the terrific success stories that we've had as a result of government regulation in the last thirty years. In the environmental area, air is much cleaner than it was twenty-five years ago, where in Chicago you couldn't open the windows without getting noticeable pollution in your face. It used to be the case that a hundred fifty million Americans lived in areas that didn't meet federal air quality standards. Now only fifty million Americans don't live in places that don't meet federal air quality standards. That's not great, but it's a wonderful improvement. The air is much cleaner than it would otherwise have been, and people are living longer and better as a result. So too, the water is much cleaner. In many ways America is the envy of the industrialized world because it has clean water compared to what it would have had without our regulatory efforts. In the area of voting rights and discrimination too, things are a lot better than they were as a result of governmental initiative. 
Thus the picture of massive government failure is way off the mark. There are many failures, but the overall picture is complex, not simple. 
The full case for big government would depend as well on the old ideal of equality of opportunity. My suggestion would be that equality of opportunity is not at odds with liberty; it is part and parcel of it. And equality of opportunity cannot exist without a large government trying to provide decent life prospects to people who now do not have decent life prospects. And the Contract of America is missing that extremely old American ideal. It used to be that equality of result was opposed to equality of opportunity; but equality of opportunity was in the 1970s an important conservative theme which justified governmental initiatives. It seems to have dropped out. 
What I'm going to emphasize, as I've said, is social norms-in particular, the possibly harmful effects of social norms on human liberty and well-being. My suggestion is that governmental action designed to make for good social norms is an important and underexplored avenue for law. This is a realm in which a lot of good things can be done; but it's something on which lawyers and politicians have spent far too little of their time. Four hundred thousand people die each year as a result of smoking; three hundred thousand people die as a result of diet and failure to exercise; a hundred thousand people die from cars and guns; and in all of these cases social norms are an important contributor to the problem. If we could do something about the norms, we could do something enormously important. This issue has gotten a lot of attention in the area of teenage pregnancy, and here a culprit is social norms that it would be very good to change. Think now about the sharply diminishing rate of smoking among young African Americans and think of how that might be a model for strategies that would lengthen and improve lives. 
I'm just going to tell you now the claims I'm going to make and then spend the rest of the talk trying to elaborate on them a bit. First: A lot of anomalies in individual behavior-such as the difference between how much people would be willing to pay to preserve a species and how much people would have to be paid to allow a species to go extinct-are just a product of social norms that affect us every day and make us do things that are surprising or might be surprising. Many puzzles in behavior are less puzzling if we attend to the pervasive role of social norms. Second: Often people live with norms that they simultaneously don't like but can't change on their own. To change a norm with respect to, for example, what a teacher ought to wear to class or to give a lecture is something an individual can't do anything about. My proposition is there are social norms all over the place that we live with, are governed by, but of which we don't approve if we reflect. Collective action is necessary to do something about them. 
Third: I suggest that social states are often far more fragile than they seem, and, in fact, change is far more likely than it seems, partly because what people want, and by people I mean to include all of us, is a function of what other people want and of what we perceive other people to want. When we start to perceive other people's perceptions as different from what we thought, things can change very fast. Something like this has happened, I believe, in the United States with respect to affirmative action. Whatever we think of the merits of the attack on affirmative action, there has been real fragility in the proaffirmative action policy. One of the reasons is, there was widespread social discontent about affirmative action that wasn't expressed because people perceived it as illegitimate to criticize affirmative action. Once the criticism started being expressed and legitimated, people's perceptions of what other people thought shifted very fast and there was a social movement. 
How was communism maintained for so long? How did it fall so fast and so safely in most Eastern European countries? One of the reasons is that there were social norms in place under communism that suggested we all had to join the Party and celebrate it, even though hardly anyone celebrated it. Once the social norms with respect to approval of communism started to shift there was a bandwagon effect or a cascade, and things changed really rapidly. The same thing happened in South Africa with respect to apartheid. 
Fourth: I'm going to suggest that sometimes social norms are an obstacle to human liberty or autonomy and sometimes social norms help maintain something like a caste system on the basis of race and sex. We don't have in the United States a true caste system, but our system has features of racial and gender caste in the sense that there are signals given by one's skin color or one's gender that one can't do much about and that is associated in many places with certain prescribed social roles. To work against them it would be good to do something about prevailing norms, and to do that it would be good to use law. 
Now let me offer three concepts: Social norms, social roles, and social meanings. First, what I've referred to, is social norms. By this I mean to refer to social attitudes of disapproval and approval, embodied in the notion that "it isn't done." With respect to lots of behavior there is a reaction, "it isn't done." Even though it sometimes is done, the term "it isn't done" is a reflection of evaluation and disapproval. Now norms cover a very wide range-what sorts of words one uses, what counts as good manners, how one deals with one's elders or people who are younger, and so forth. Norms are pervasive and invisible only because they're so deeply internalized that they don't come out to the surface much. There are social norms with respect to such things as smoking, discriminating, using condoms, buckling seat belts and recycling. These norms are often fragile. One's choices about what to do, whether to smoke, whether to discriminate, whether to buckle a seat belt, whether to be courteous-these things are a function, for each individual, not just of the value of the relevant thing but also of the reputational value of doing or having that thing, that is, smoking, having a Hispanic in one's restaurant or buckling one's belt. It's also a function of one's self-conception if one does these sorts of things. There are many people, I assert, who don't buckle their seat belt and who do smoke as a result of social norms and the opposite too. Often one will or will not buckle because of the group of people with whom one finds oneself. One will or will not smoke for just that reason; the reputational effect plays a very large role in individual choices. 
It's also the case that one's self-conception plays a large role. There is a mystery in the fact that Stephen Hawking's book, "A Brief Moment in Time," was a best seller. This was a book that was bought by people of whom it is said hardly any read the book. Why did people buy it? My speculation is that some of the purchases had to do with the reputational value of having the book and with one's feeling about one's self-conception from owning the book. 
Choices are pervasively a product not just of the intrinsic value of the underlying thing but also of reputational effects and effects on one's self-conception. The reputational effects and the effects on one's self-conception are partly a function of social norms. Prevailing norms will have a lot to do with reputation and probably a good deal with self-conception. This is why I think the people recycling in East Hampton were so happy. It's not as if there was intrinsic joy in separating the various things; but they felt good about themselves, they felt good about being seen doing this sort of thing; and therefore they undertook a choice that would have been completely astonishing ten years before. 
I have an economist colleague who has a dog and in Chicago there is a norm, there's a law too, that you clean up after your dog. And he said, "You know, at night I walk my dog, and when he does what he does I clean up even if it's dark." He said, "I don't know why I do that. I hate the act, it subjects me to a certain amount of danger, and yet I do it." He said, "I would have thought it would have been about reputation, but it's dark, no one can see me." I think the reason he does it is that he's internalized the norm so he thinks it's a wrong thing to do to leave that material there for the next morning. And that's why in many areas of the country something is true now that would also have been astonishing years ago, that is, no dog poop on the sidewalks. 
That's the first concept, the idea of social norms. The second concept involves the notion of social roles-something that also has a great deal to do with law but hasn't been explored much by people thinking about law. Each of us occupies an astonishingly wide range of social roles: child, parent, sibling, student, teacher, voter, consumer, eater in a restaurant. Each of those roles is surrounded by a complex network of social norms, so much so that if one acted in one role the way one acts without thinking in another role it would seem very bizarre. If one treated, for example, one's employer the way one treats a friend, in most American work places that would be perceived as quite strange. If a teacher treated a student the way a teacher treats a doctor, wouldn't you think that teacher is very confused? Or if you treated your lawyer in the same way you treat your waiter, your lawyer would think this is odd. Or if your waiter treated you the way your friends treat you; that would be very unusual, except in California, I guess. In any case, each social role is pervaded by social norms that people know about, adhere to, rarely step out of, even though some of us some of the time wish our social roles were a bit different. And here too changes in social roles are just about impossible at the individual level. 
The feminist movement has everything to do with the effort to change social norms associated with the social role of being a woman. When homosexuals "flaunt it," there might be a self-conscious effort to change the social role of being a homosexual, that is to be closeted. The point here is that social roles are pervasive and also we are, with respect to them, acted on as much as we are acting. If we're going to change them we need some help. We can't do it on our own. 
The third and last concept let's call social meaning. And here I'm drawing on some work by anthropologists and also some recent work in law on exactly this idea. By social meaning I mean the attitudes and commitments that are communicated by words or actions. Words or actions communicate something independent of the words that are actually being used. For example, the use of the term "Miss" or "Mrs." now means something very different from what it meant forty years ago. There is something very specific signaled if one of your instructors calls women students Miss or Mrs. The social meaning being communicated might well be independent of the intentions of the speaker. With respect to a wide range of terms, social meanings attach over which the speaker has no control. If a teacher calls a student by a first name or if a student calls a teacher by a first name, something is being signaled that the individual agent doesn't have much control over. If a teacher wears blue jeans to class at many law schools, something very particular is connoted. If someone buckles a seat belt in some parts of the world, or if a woman refuses to cook dinner in many parts of the world, or if a man or woman insists on the use of a condom in many places, there is a particular social meaning to the act which agents don't have control over and might be unfortunate. There was an article in the New York Times a few weeks ago in which some young men were saying they don't use condoms with their girlfriends because their girlfriends would take that as a confession that they're promiscuous. Now that's a problem. They may not need to be blamed for it. But it's true the social meaning of condom use is a confession or, in some circles, an accusation. Social norms, social meanings, and social roles matter. If people see one another cooperating by giving time or money, working pro bono, donating to charity, writing tenure letters, then they tend to cooperate, too. But if they don't see one another cooperating, rates of noncooperation skyrocket. This is true in both experimental and real world settings. Whether people cooperate to solve a shared problem is a function of the perceived behavior of other people. This may not seem a puzzle; but for certain theories of rational behavior it is indeed a puzzle. Cooperation is closely enmeshed with social norms. 
Economists have invented a game. It's called the Ultimatum Game. This is a game in which two people are given a bunch of money to play a game. The game has one act in it, that is one person of the two says to the other person, "I will give you X amount of this pot." If the second person says, "I accept," they both get to keep the relevant amounts. If the other person says, "I don't accept," neither gets to keep a penny. In experimental settings what would you expect would happen? How much would the first person propose and what would the second person accept? The economists predicted the following: The first person acting in a self-interested way will say, "I'll offer you a penny." And the second person will say, "Great." The first person acts in the self-interested way; the second person acts in a self-interested way; both people are better off. But this is not what happens. People almost never offer a penny, and when they do it's not accepted. There's a very high percentage of fifty/fifty, sixty/forty, seventy/thirty splits. This is because there is a powerful social norm saying that if you accept a penny you're showing your willingness to be subjected to contempt or dishonor. And if you offer that little, then you're showing a willingness to treat someone else in a contemptuous way. And there are extremely powerful social norms against that. People feel ashamed in both contexts. 
This example aligns my argument with some of the arguments in modem politics about deploying shame as a policy instrument. Shame is certainly not an intrinsic good, but shame is important and reduces conduct that inflicts harm on other people. This little story tends to show that what seems like anomalies often are a function of deeply internalized social norms, which when they disappear, make people's lives go much less well. 
I am also concerned about the use of words like "choices" or "preferences" to foreclose discussion of what government ought to be doing. Often it is said that people choose some acts, and it is asked, what business is it of Big Brother to alter the choice? At least as a general rule, what business is it of government to interfere with their preferences? And in very tempting arguments, the words "their choices" or "their preferences" opt as conversation stoppers. I hope what I've said already suggests that this argument goes by much too fast, if our preferences and choices are artifacts of norms and roles and meanings that we haven't voluntarily assumed and that we may not like but we can't change on our own. If the meaning of our choice not to go in a car which we know is going to go extremely fast is cowardice, then we might go in that car or even drive in that way. That's enmeshed with social norms over which people have very little control. And to attribute that to them--to say that that's their choice or their preference-is too quick. In the New York Times article I mentioned about condom use, young men were saying they didn't use condoms because they did not want their girlfriends to think they were sleeping around. They weren't happy with that situation. They weren't sleeping around. They wanted the social meaning of condom use to be different from what it was. To say we should respect their choice would be a much too simple answer. 
Incidentally, I'm told by my sister-in-law who works on AIDS education in Bali, that there's been a remarkable change in Bali in the last seven years, so that young Balinese men consider their condom use a very macho thing. Now, she's not sure how this social norm has gotten in place, but she says it's wonderful. If in Bali there is going to be some protection, so to speak, against what's happened in many countries like Bali, this is a way. 
Now let's turn to government. How might government do something about problematic norms or meanings and roles? Let's have an ascending order of intrusiveness. The most lenient thing government can do is just provide information. Changing social norms with respect to smoking has a great deal to do with additional information. When we undertake behavior that is dangerous and perceived as such, there are often strong social norms against it. It's very interesting to see in religious communities the extent to which there are norms about diet and behavior that are permeated with beliefs about safety; but the moral issues associated with the diet have outrun the safety belief so that it's believed it is morally wrong to perform some acts. The moral judgment has become more deeply ingrained than the health judgment. In any case, with respect to a great number of things, simple provision of information does the trick. 
Government might try to go beyond information and try to persuade. This is what's happened in the area of smoking and drug use and safe sex. The efforts of persuasion may be futile, but it's a possible approach. 
There might also be an effort to change social norms with a tax. Consider a tax on cigarettes or alcohol or other dangerous behavior. And that might change the relevant norm. 
Or the government might try, most simply, coercion by banning conduct. 
Now what I'm going to do is to go through several categories of cases in which governmental action designed to change norms and roles and meanings might well be justified. To make the justification full in any individual case, one would have to say more than I'm going to say. I'm just going to go through a set of cases. 
The simplest is the set of cases I have described. That is, cases involving norms that people want to change but can't change on their own. They require governmental or collective help of some kind. Now, there is a very intriguing class of laws which exist which are almost never enforced, but which accomplish an enormous amount of good-that have a kind of symbolic function just by virtue of the fact that they are there. These include laws forbidding littering, laws requiring seat belts to be buckled, laws encouraging or requiring recycling, and laws requiring people to clean up after their pets. These are laws that have contributed an enormous amount to environmental improvement. And the way they do that is signaling something that has a powerful effect on people's norms. And in these cases government can relatively cheaply use the law to attempt what the majority wants, that is norm change. 
The second kind of case has to do with the difference between the social role of consumer and the social role of citizen. Both of us occupy these two roles. We buy things and watch things and we vote and we make public policy recommendations. Here is the key proposition. In our capacity as consumers we may live within norms which we simultaneously, in our capacity as citizens, deplore. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 is under some attack now in some prominent circles. An interesting fact is that that act was supported by restaurants that were discriminators. Restaurants that acknowledged their own discriminatory behavior favored the law. How could that be? What they said was, "If we open our doors to African Americans, what will happen is that we'll be in social trouble because the norm is we're not supposed to do that. But we just want to make profits. If you give us this law, we can make more profits and we won't confront the old norm." These are cases in which people, in their capacity as citizens, urge results that differ from their own private consumption behavior. Many Americans favor more educational programming for children on television, or more public affairs programming on television for themselves. Would they watch it? Would they ask their children to watch it? Maybe not. Is it illegitimate for people in their capacity as citizens to urge and get results that diverge from what happens from consumption choices? I don't think so. And words like "choices" tend to cloud the issue. 
In many parts of the world, and in some parts of America, to be well educated is inconsistent with social norms. Probably most of the people in this room have encountered some places where if you say you're in law school, people don't say, "Great." They might say a wide range of things. But one thing some people might say is, "Who do you think you are," something like that. Now, there are many places in the world and some places in America where norms in a relevant community operate powerfully against people's efforts to educate or better themselves by going to school or taking school seriously. Many of the hardest problems that people face is running up against social norms that make their efforts to better themselves by their own lights seem a source of shame. It's parallel to the condom story and the seat belt story; but maybe more poignant because it involves people's basic life prospects. There are things that government can do and that can be done collectively to make it so that education isn't stigmatizing but the opposite. There are places in the world where women who try to become literate are ostracized. And by acting on social norms the law might well be able to do something about it. 
I have referred to the issue of caste. And by the issue of caste I mean just the fact that even in a free society like ours there are statuses that people have. For example, the experiences of African Americans vis-a-vis the police are systematically different from the experiences of white people vis-a-vis the police. That's one sense in which we have something like a caste system in the United States. There are similar things with respect to sex roles where there are many places where if a woman says, "I'm not making dinner tonight. I'm going out to a meeting," the signal that's given is fundamentally different from the similar signal for a man. 
Now, the antidiscrimination laws are, in some circles, under attack as liberty denying. But we might think that the liberty issue is much more complicated than that, in the face of social norms that are connected with caste-like features of existing social practices. And if what the law can do is alter the norm, liberty might be promoted rather than undermined. There are many norms that undermine human well-being; for example, norms that make it seem very good for a teenage boy to have gotten a woman pregnant; norms that make it seem very good for a teenage girl to have a child, notwithstanding her inability to take care of it; norms that make being on welfare seem highly desirable and being in work at a low-paying job seem a social stigma. There are norms that encourage hazardous behavior that is undermining of human well-being. There are things that law might be able to do about this. It might be counterproductive; it might be futile; but this is an unexplored area where law could do a lot of good. 
My last point has to do with what we might call the expressive function of law. With respect to our own behavior, often what we do is connected with the message the action expresses as much as with the consequences. There are famous philosophical puzzles about whether you would shoot an innocent person when a terrorist threatens otherwise to shoot a hundred people. Would you shoot the terrorist? Would you shoot the person the terrorist tells you to shoot if the terrorist would otherwise shoot a hundred people? Most react to that by saying, "I don't know. I don't know if I could. I don't know if I would." Most people hesitate. It's partly because of the expressive function of action and what one is expressing about oneself by shooting an innocent person. Law too often has an expressive function in the sense that it signals national or social commitments, partly in order to make for change with respect to (say) endangered species, recycling, smoking, sex equality. The expressive function of law doesn't have directly to do with consequences but instead with the norms that are being signalled and promoted. 
At this stage it's probably worth mentioning that the term "political correctness" is very interesting along this dimension because the term "political correctness," as it's deployed, operates to make people seem pitiful and weak if they believe, for example, that sexual harassment is a bad thing. And it's a brilliant term because of its shifting effect on social norms. It makes it so that what was otherwise forwardlooking and bold seems shameful and stepping with the crowd. 
It is time to conclude. It is often said that the government should respect people's preferences and choices. I've suggested that that's too simple, because preferences and choices are often an artifact of roles, norms and meanings. All of these things, that is, roles, norms and meanings, can be obstacles to human liberty or autonomy or well-being. Of course governmental efforts to change them might be futile or it might be counterproductive. But, it might not. It would be a shame if the antigovernment rhetoric of the last decade foreclosed efforts to seek change by repeating a mantra about the need to respect choice.

Thus wrote the Departmentof Commerceon September15, 1993, when the federal governmentannouncedan "Agendafor Action"with respectto "the National Information Infrastructure."T5he statement may seem weirdly futuristic,but the nationis not at all farfromwhatit prophesies,andin ways thathave alreadyalteredsocial and legal relationsand categories. 
Consider the extraordinarilyrapid development of the institution of electronicmail, which lies somewherebetweenordinaryconversation("voice mail")and ordinarywrittencommunication("snailmail"or "hardmail"),or whichperhapsshouldbe describedas somethingelse altogetherE.-mailhas its own characteristicnormsandconstraintsT.hose normsandconstraintsarean importantpartof the informal,unwrittenlaw of cyberspace.The normsand constraintsare a form of customarylaw, determininghow and when people communicatewith one another.6Perhapsthere will be a formal codification movementbeforetoo long; certainlythe normsandconstraintsarecodifiedin the sense that, without governmentassistance,they are easily accessible by people who want to know what they are.7 
The CommerceDepartment'sclaims aboutlocationhave startedto come true. What it meantto "live in California"became altogetherdifferent,after the invention of the airplane,from what it meant in (say) 1910. With the adventof new communicationstechnologies,the meaningof the statement,"I live in California"has changed at least as dramaticallyI.f people can have instantaccess to all librariesandall movies, andif they can communicatewith a wide rangeof public officials, pharmacistse,ducators,doctors,and lawyers by touching a few buttons, they may as well (for most purposes) live anywhere. 
In any case, the existence of technologicalchange promises to test the system of free expression in dramaticways. What should be expected with respectto the FirstAmendment? 
II. THE PRESENT:MARKETSAND MADISON 
Therearetwo free speechtraditionsin the UnitedStates,not simplyone.8 There have been two models of the First Amendment,correspondingto the two free speech traditions.The first emphasizes well-functioning speech markets.It can be tracedto JusticeHolmes' greatAbramsdissent,9wherethe notion of a "marketin ideas"receivedits preeminentexposition.The market model emerges as well from Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo,10 invalidatinga "rightof reply"law as appliedto candidatesfor elected office. It finds its most recentdefiningstatementnot in judicial decisions, but in an FCC opinion rejectingthe fairnessdoctrine. 
The secondtradition,andthe secondmodel,focuseson publicdeliberation. The second model can be traced from its origins in the work of James Madison,12 with his attack on the idea of seditious libel, to Justice Louis Brandeis,with his suggestionthat"thegreatestmenaceto freedomis an inert people,""3throughthe workof AlexanderMeiklejohn,who associatedthe free speechprinciplenot withlaissez-faireeconomics,butwithidealsof democratic deliberation.14 The Madisoniantraditionculminatedin New YorkTimes v. Sullivan15 and the reaffirmationof the fairness doctrine in the Red Lion case,16 with the Supreme Court's suggestion that governmentalefforts to encouragediverseviews andattentionto publicissues arecompatiblewith the free speech principle--even if they resultin regulatorycontrolson the owners of speech sources. 
Underthe marketplacemetaphort,he FirstAmendmentrequires-at least as a presumption-a free speech market, or in other words a system of unrestrictedeconomic marketsin speech.Governmentmustrespectthe forces of supply and demand.At the very least, it may not regulatethe contentof speech so as to push the speech marketin its preferreddirections.Certainlyit must be neutral with respect to viewpoint. A key point for marketplace advocatesis that greatdistrustof governmentis especially appropriatewhen speech is at issue. Illicit motives are far too likely to underlie regulatory initiatives.For the marketplacemodel, Tornillo'7is perhapsthe centralcase. The FCC has at times come close to endorsingthe marketmodel, above all in its decision abandoningthe fairness doctrine.'8When the FCC did this, it referredto the operationof the forces of supply and demand,and suggested that those forces would producean optimal mix of entertainmentoptions."9 Hence formerFCC ChairMarkFowler describedtelevision as "justanother appliance. It's a toaster with pictures."20Undoubtedly,the rise of new communicationstechnologieswill be takento fortify this claim.21 
Those who endorsethe marketplacemodel do not claim thatgovernment may not do anythingat all. Of coursegovernmentmay set up the basic rules of propertyand contract;it is these rulesthatmake marketsfeasible. Without such rules, marketscannot exist at all.22Governmentis also permittedto 
ConvergingCommunicationsMedia, 104 YALEL.J. 1719 (1995). 

It is regrettable,thoughnot difficult to explain, thatin the past much less attentionhas been given to the positive requirementsof a successfulworkingof the competitivesystem than to these [previously discussed] negative points. The functioningof a competitionnot only requires adequateorganizationof certain institutionslike money, markets,and channels of information-some of which can never be adequatelyprovidedby privateenterprise-but it depends, above all, on the existence of an appropriatelegal system, a legal system designed both to preservecompetitionand to make it operateas beneficiallyas possible.... protect against market failures, especially by preventing monopolies and monopolisticpractices.Structuralregulationis acceptableso long as it is a content-neutraalttemptto ensurecompetition.It is thereforeimportanto note thatadvocatesof marketplacesanddemocracymightworktogetherin seeking to curtailmonopoly.Of course,the preventionof monopolyis a precondition for well-functioninginformationmarkets. 
Governmenthas a finalauthorityt,houghthis authoritydoes not easily fall withinthe marketplacemodelitself. Most people who acceptthe marketplace model acknowledgethatgovernmentis permittedto regulatethe variouswelldefined categories of controllable speech, such as obscenity, false or misleading commercialspeech, and libel.23This acknowledgmentwill have large and not yet explored consequencesfor governmentcontrols on new informationtechnologies.Perhapsthe government'spowerto controlobscene, threatening,or libelous speech will justify special rules for cyberspace.24But with these qualifications,the commitmentto free economic marketsis the basic constitutionalcreed. 
Many people think that there is now nothing distinctive about the electronicmedia or aboutmoderncommunicationstechnologiesthatjustifies an additional governmentalrole.25If such a role was ever justified, they would argue, it was because of problems of scarcity. When only three televisionnetworksexhaustedthe availableoptions,a marketfailuremayhave called for regulationdesigned to ensure that significantnumbersof people were not left withouttheirpreferredprogramming.2B6ut this is no longer a problem.With so dramatica proliferationof stations,most people can obtain the programmingthey want, or will be able to soon.27With cyberspace, people will be able to make or to participatein their own preferred programmingin their own preferred"locations"on the Internet.With new technologies, perhapsthere are no real problemscalling for governmental controls,except for those designedto establishthe basic framework. 
In no system that could be rationallydefended would the state just do nothing. An effective competitivesystem needs an intelligentlydesignedand continuouslyadjustedlegal frameworkas muchas any other.

The second model, receiving its most sustainedattentionin the writings of AlexanderMeiklejohn,28emphasizesthat our constitutionalsystem is one of deliberativedemocracy.This system prizes both political (not economic) equalityanda sharedcivic culture.It seeks to promote,as a centraldemocratic goal, reflectiveand deliberativedebateaboutpossible courses of action. The Madisonianmodel sees the rightof free expressionas a key partof the system of public deliberation. 
On this view, even a well-functioning information market29is not immunefrom governmentcontrols.Governmentis certainlynot permittedto regulatespeech however it wants;it may not restrictspeech on the basis of viewpoint. But it may regulatethe electronicmedia or even cyberspaceto promote,in a sufficientlyneutralway, a well-functioningdemocraticregime. It may attemptto promote attentionto public issues. It may try to ensure diversity of view. It may promotepolitical speech at the expense of other formsof speech.In particulare,ducationalandpublic-affairsprogrammingo,n the Madisonianview, has a special place. 
I cannot attemptin this space to defend fully the propositionthat the Madisonianconceptionis superiorto the marketplacealternativeas a matter of constitutionallaw;30a few brief notes will have to suffice. The argument for the Madisonianconceptionis partlyhistorical;the Americanfree speech traditionowes muchof its originandshapeto a conceptionof democraticselfgovernment.The marketplaceconceptionis a creationof thetwentiethcentury, not of the eighteenth.As a matterof history,it confuses modernnotions of consumersovereigntyin the marketplacewith democraticunderstandingsof sovereignty,symbolizedby the transferof sovereigntyfromthe King to "We the People." The American free speech traditionfinds its origin in that conceptionof sovereignty,which,in Madison'sview, doomedthe SeditionAct on constitutionalgrounds.31 
But the argumentfor Madisonianismdoes not rest only on history;it is partly evaluative as well. We are unlikely to be able to make sense of our consideredjudgmentsaboutfreespeechproblemswithoutinsistingthatthefree speechprincipleis centrally(thoughcertainlynot exclusively)connectedwith democraticgoals,32and withoutacknowledgingthat marketplacethinkingis inadequatelyconnected with the point and function of a system of free expression. A well-functioning democracy requires a degree of citizen participation,which requiresa degree of information;3a3nd large disparities 
1805 (1995), on the risks posed by such a system. 
in political (as opposed to economic) equality are damagingto democratic aspirations.34To the extent that the Madisonian view prizes education, democratic deliberation, and political equality, it is connected, as the marketplace conception is not, with the highest ideals of American constitutionalism. 
Some people think that the distinction between marketplace and Madisonian models is now an anachronism.35Perhaps the two models conflictedat an earlierstage in history;but in one view, Madisonhas no place in an era of limitless broadcastingoptions and cyberspace. Perhaps new technologiesnow meanthatMadisoniangoals canbest be satisfiedin a system of free markets.Now that so many channels,e-mail options, and discussion "places"are available,cannoteveryonereador see whatthey wish? If people want to spend their time on public issues, are there not countless available opportunities?Is this not especially truewith the emergenceof the Internet? Is it not hopelessly paternalistic,or anachronisticf,or governmentto regulate for Madisonianreasons? 
I do not believe that these questionsare rhetorical.We know enough to know that even in a periodof limitless options, our communicationssystem may fail to promotean educatedcitizenryand politicalequality.Madisonian goals may be severelycompromisedeven undertechnologicallyextraordinary conditions. There is no logical or a priori connection between a wellfunctioningsystem of free expressionand limitless broadcastingor Internet options.We could well imaginea science fictionstoryin which a wide range of options coexisted with little or no high-qualityfare for children, with widespreadpolitical apathy or ignorance,and with social balkanizationin which most people's consumption choices simply reinforced their own prejudicesand platitudes,or even worse. 
Quite outside of science fiction, it is foreseeable that free marketsin communicationswill be a mixed blessing. They could create a kind of accelerating"raceto the bottom,"in which many or most people see lowquality programming involving trumped-up scandals or sensationalistic anecdotes calling for little in terms of quality or quantityof attention.It is easily imaginablethatwell-functioningmarketsin communicationswill bring abouta situationin which many of those interestedin politics merely fortify their own unreflectivejudgments,and are exposed to little or nothingin the way of competingviews,36IIttis eeaasiyiliymaginable thatthe contentof the most widely viewed programmingwill be affectedby the desiresof advertisers,in such a way as to produceshows thatrepresenta bland,watered-downversion of conventionalmorality,and that do not engage serious issues in a serious way for fear of offending some groupin the audience.37 
Consider,by way of summaryof existing fare, the suggestionthat TV favors a mentality in which certain things no longer matter particularly:skills like the ability to enjoy a complex argument,for instance,or to perceivenuances,or to keep in mindlargeamountsof significantinformation,or to remembertodaywhatsomeonesaid last month,or to considerstrongandcarefullyarguedopinionsin defiance of what is conventionally called "balance."Its content lurches between violence of action, emotionalhyperbole,and blandnessof opinion.... CommercialTV... has come to presentsociety as a pagancircusof freaks,pseudo-heroes,andwild morons,struggleson the sandof a Colosseumwithoutwalls. It thushelps immeasurablyto worsenthe defects of Americanpubliceducationandof tabloidnews in* print3.8 From the standpoint of the present, it is easily imaginable that the television-or the personal computer carrying out communications functions-will indeed become "just another appliance ... a toaster with pictures,"andthatthe educativeor aspirationagloals of the FirstAmendment will be lost or even forgotten. 
I shall say more aboutthese pointsbelow.39For now it is safe to say that the law of free speech will ultimatelyhave to make some hardchoices about the marketplaceanddemocraticmodels.It is also safe to say thatthe changing natureof the informationmarketwill test the two modelsin new ways. In fact, the SupremeCourthas recentlyofferedan importantdiscussionof the topic, TurnerBroadcastingSystem,Inc. v. FCC.40Turneris also the most sustained explorationof the relationshipbetweenconventionallegal categoriesand the new informationtechnologies.The decisioncontainsa rangeof lessons for the future. 
My principalpurposehere is to discuss the role of the FirstAmendment and Madisonianism in cyberspace-or, more simply, the nature of constitutionalconstraintson governmentregulationof electronicbroadcasting, especially in the aftermathof Turner.In so doing, I will cover a good deal of ground,and a numberof issues of law andpolicy, in a relativelyshortspace. I do, however, offer three relatively simple goals to help organize the discussion. Most important,I attempt to make a defense of Madisonian conceptionsof free speech, even in a periodin which scarcityis no longer a serious problem.The defense stressesthe risks of sensationalism,ignorance, failure of deliberation, and balkanization-risks that are in some ways heightened by new developments. In the process I discuss some of the questionsthat are likely to arise in the next generationof free speech law. 
I have two othergoals as well. I attemptto identifyan intriguingandnew model of the First Amendmentand to ask whetherthat model-the Turner model-is well adapted to the future of the speech market. A relatively detailed and somewhat technical discussion of Turnershould prove useful, because the case raises the largerissues in a concretesetting. 
I also urge that,for the most part,the emergingtechnologiesdo not raise new questionsaboutbasicprinciplebutinsteadproducenew areasfor applying or perhapstesting old principles.The existing analogiesare often very good, and this means thatthe new law can begin by buildingfairly comfortablyon the old. The principalproblemwiththe old law is not so muchthatit is poorly adaptedfor currentissues-though in some cases it may be-but thatit does not depend on a clear sense of the purposeor point of the system of free expression. In building law for an age of cyberspace, government officials-within the judiciaryand elsewhere-should be particularlycareful not to treatdoctrinalcategoriesas ends in themselves.Much less shouldthey act as if the First Amendmentis a purposelessabstractionunconnectedto ascertainablesocial goals. Instead they should keep in mind that the free speech principle has a point, or a set of points. Among its points is the commitmentto democraticself-government. 
The Turnercase is by far the most importantjudicial discussionof new media technologies, and it has a range of implications for the future. I thereforebegin with thatcase, turningto broaderissues of law and policy in Part V. It is important,however, to say that Turnerinvolved two highly distinctive problems:(a) the peculiar "bottleneck"producedby the current system of cable television, in which cable owners can control access to programminga;nd(b) the possibleriskto free televisionprogrammingcreated by the rise of pay television. These problemsturnedout to be centralto the outcomein the case. Forthis reason,Turneris quitedifferentfromimaginable futurecases involving new informationtechnologies,includingthe Internet, which includesno bottleneckproblem.Significantly,the Internetis ownedby no one and controlled by no organization.But at least potentially, the principlesin Turnerwill extend quitebroadly.This is especially true insofar as the Court adopted ingredientsof an entirely new model of the First Amendmentand insofar as the Court set out principlesgoverning content discrimination,viewer access, speakeraccess, and regulationof owners of speech sources. 
In the last decade, it has become clear that cable television will be in potentialcompetitionwith free broadcastingI.n 1992, motivatedin largepart by concerns about this form of competition,Congress enacted the Cable Television ConsumerProtectionand CompetitionAct (the Act).41The Act contains a range of provisions designed to protect broadcastingand local producers,and also at least nominallydesignedto protectcertainconsumers from practices by the cable industry.The relevant provisions include rate regulationsforcableoperatorsa, prohibitionon exclusivefranchiseagreements between cable operatorsand municipalities,and restrictionson affiliations between cable programmersand cable operators.42 
A majorpartof the Act was motivatedby the fearthatcable television's success could damage broadcasttelevision.43If cable flourishes, perhaps broadcasterswill fail? The scenario seems at least plausible in light of importantdifferencesin relevanttechnologies.Broadcasttelevisioncomes, of course,fromtransmittingantennae.It is availableforfree,thoughin its current form, it cannotprovidemorethana few stations.By contrast,cable systems makeuse of a physicalconnectionbetweentelevision sets anda transmission facility, and throughthis routecable operatorscan providea largenumberof stations.Cable operatorsare of course in a positionto decide which stations, andwhich stationowners,will be availableon cabletelevision;cableoperators could thus refuseto carrylocal broadcastersT.o be sure,cable operatorsmust respondto forces of supplyanddemand,andperhapsthey would do poorlyif they failed to carry local broadcasters.But because they have "bottleneck control" over the stations that they will carry, they are in one sense monopolists,or at least so Congressappearsto have thought. 
fortypercentof Americanslacka cableconnection,andmustthereforerely on broadcaststations.44(This is a point of general importancein light of the possibility that access to communicationstechnology will in the futurebe unequally distributed.)In the Act, the potentialconflict between cable and broadcast television led Congress to set out two crucial, hotly disputed provisions. Both provisionsrequiredcable operatorsto carrythe signals of

local broadcasttelevision stations.These "must-carryr"uleswere the focus of the Turnercase. 
The first provision, section 4, imposes must-carry rules for "local commercialtelevision stations."45Under the Act, cable systems with more than twelve active channelsand more thanthree hundredavailablechannels mustset aside as manyas one-thirdof theirchannelsfor commercialbroadcast stations requestingcarriage.46These stationsare defined to include all fullpower television broadcastersexcept those that qualify as "noncommercial educational"stations.47 
Section 5 adds a different requirement.4I8t governs "noncommercial educationaltelevision stations,"definedto include(a) stationsthatare owned and operated by a municipality and that transmit "predominantly noncommercialprogramsfor educationalpurposes"4o9r (b) stationsthat are licensed by the FCC as such stationsand that are eligible to receive grants from the Corporationfor Public Broadcasting.5S0ection 5 imposes separate must-carryrules on noncommercialeducationalstations.A cable system with more than thirty-sixchannelsmust carryeach local public broadcaststation requestingcarriage;51a station having between thirteenand thirty-six must carrybetween one and three;52and a stationwith twelve or fewer channels must carryat least one.53 
What was the purposeof the must-carryrules?This is a complex matter. A skeptic, or perhapsa realist,might well say that the rules were simply a product of the political power of the broadcastingindustry.Perhaps the broadcastingindustry was trying to protect its economic interests at the expense of cable. This is a quitereasonablesuggestion,for it is unlikelythat marketarrangementswould lead to a situationin which significantnumbers of Americans are entirely without access to television broadcasting.The scenariothatCongressapparentlyfeared-a victoryof cabletelevisionoverthe broadcastingindustry,with the resultthat forty percentof Americanswould lack television at all-seems wildly unrealistic.Insofar as Congress was responding to the interests of local broadcasters,it may well have been cateringto interest-powerratherthanattemptingto protectotherwisedeprived consumers. 
defendedas public-interestedor as helpingviewersandconsumers,will often be a productof privateself-interest,and not good for the public at all. It is undoubtedlytrue that industrieswill often seek governmenthelp againstthe marketplace,invoking public-spiritedjustificationsfor self-interestedends.54 Whetherand to what extentthis is a constitutional(as opposedto a political) problem may be disputed.55But it points to a distinctive and legitimate concernaboutgovernmentalregulationof the communicationsindustry. 
The interest-groupaccountthereforehas considerableplausibility.On the otherhand,some people mightreasonablythinkthatthe must-carryruleswere a good-faitheffort to protectlocal broadcastersn,ot because of theirpolitical power,but because theirspeech is valuable.Theirspeech is valuablebecause it ensuresthat viewers will be able to see discussionof local political issues. Perhapsthe must-carryrules-especially section 5, but perhapssection 4 as well-had powerfulMadisonianjustificationsinsofaras cable operatorsmight choose stations that failed to offer adequatediscussion of issues of public concern, especially to the local community.Otherobserversmight invoke a differentjustification,also with Madisonianovertones.Perhapsthe effort to protect broadcasterswas a legitimate effort to safeguardthe broadcasting industry,not because of the political power of the broadcasters,and not becauseof the contentof broadcastservice,butbecausemillionsof Americans mustrely on broadcastersfor theirprogrammingP.erhapsCongresswantedto ensureuniversalviewer access to the televisionmarket.On this view, the key goal behind the must-carryrules was to ensureviewer access. 
Let us put these possibilities to one side and take up the constitutional issue. In Turnert,he cableoperatorschallengedsections4 and5 as inconsistent with the First Amendment.They did not make a distinctionbetween section 4 and section 5; to the cable companies,both provisions were illegitimate interferenceswith theirrightto choose suchprogrammingas they wished.For obvious reasons, the government also made no such distinctions. The governmentwantedto defendboth provisions,and a defense of section 5, by itself, would produceonly a partialvictory.The key aspectsof the case lay in the operators'contentionthat both sections amountedto a form of content regulation,and thateven if they shouldbe seen as content-neutralt,hey were unconstitutionablecause inadequatelyjustified. 
In its response,the Courtcreatedsomethingvery muchlike a new model for understandingthe relationshipbetween new technologies and the First Amendment.This model is a competitorto the marketplaceand Madisonian alternatives.And while it is somewhatunruly,it is not difficultto describe.It comes from the five basic componentsof the Court'sresponseto the cable operators'challenge. 
First,the Courtheld thatcabletelevisionwouldnotbe subjectto the more lenient free speech limitationsappliedto broadcasters.5O6n the Court'sview, the key to the old broadcastcases was scarcity,and scarcityis not a problem for cable stations. To be sure, there are possible "marketdysfunctions"for cable television; as noted, cable operatorsmay in a sense be a monopolyby virtue of their "bottleneckcontrol."But this structuralfact did not, in the Court's view, dictate a more lenient approachin the cable context. In the Court'sview, the key point in the past cases had to do with scarcity. 
This is an especially significant holding.57 It suggests that new technologieswill generallybe subjectto ordinaryfree speechstandardsn,ot to the morelenientstandardsappliedto broadcastersS.carcityis rarelya problem for new technologies. 
Second, the Court said that the Act was content-neutrala,nd therefore subjectto the morelenientstandardsgoverningcontent-neutrarlestrictionson speech. For the Court,the centralpoint is that"themust-carryrules, on their face, impose burdensand confer benefitswithoutreferenceto the contentof speech."58This is because "the extent of the interferencedoes not depend uponthe contentof the cable operators'programming."5In9 the Court'sview, the regulationsare certainlyspeaker-based,since we have to know who the speakeris to know whetherthe regulationsapply;but they are not contentbased, since they do not punishor requirespeech of a particularcontent. 
This holding is also quite important.It means that Congress will be permittedto regulateparticulartechnologiesin particularways, so long as the regulationis not transparentlya subterfugefor a legislativedesireto promote particularpoints of view. It meansthatCongresscan give special benefitsto special sources,or impose special burdenson disfavoredindustries. 
Third,the Courtsaid that therewas insufficientreasonto believe that a content-based"purpose"underlaythe content-neutramlust-carrylaw.60Hence the contentneutralityof the law could not be impeachedby an investigation of the factors that led to its enactment.The Court explored the relevant 
neverbeen a secureone. See RonaldH. Coase, TheFederalCommunicationCsommission,2 J.L.& ECON. 1, 14, 20 (1959). Perhapsmarketfailuresof a certainsortjustifiedspecial controlson local broadcasting. See OWEN& WILDMANsu,pra note 26, at 275-76. But if this is true,the questionbecomes whetherthere are marketfailures, and of what sorts, ratherthan whetherthere is "scarcity."Hence the Court'scrisp distinctionbetween scarce sourcesand nonscarcesourcesis quitecrude. 
legislative findings, which showed not only a (by hypothesisquestionable61) congressionalinterestin encouragingthe sortsof programmingofferedby local broadcastersb,ut also a distinctiveandlegitimateconcernthatcable operators have a strongfinancialinterestin favoringtheirown affiliatedprogrammers, and in doing so at the expense of broadcaststations.The findingstherefore suggested that the cable operatorshave an economic incentive not to carry local signals. 
This fact led to the importantproblemsupportingthe Act: Withoutthe must-carryprovision, Congress concluded, there would be a threat to the continuedavailabilityof free local broadcasttelevision.62The eliminationof broadcasttelevision would in turnbe undesirablenot because broadcasters deserveprotectionas such-they do not-but because(a) broadcasttelevision is free and (b) thereis a substantialgovernmentinterestin assuringaccess to free programming,especially for people who cannot afford to pay for television. As Congress had it, the must-carryrules would ensure that the broadcaststationswould stay in business. 
The Court said that this purpose-the protection of access to free programmingthroughthe protectionof broadcaststations-was unrelatedto the content of broadcastexpression and was therefore legitimate. It was significantin this regardthat for Congressto seek to protectbroadcasters, Congressdid not have to favorany particularkindor speechor any particular point of view. To be sure, and importantly,Congress' descriptionof the purposesof the Act also referredto a content-basedconcern-to the effect that broadcastprogrammingis "animportantsourceof local news[,] public-affairs programmingand other local broadcast services critical to an informed electorate," and also to the judgment that noncommercialtelevision in particular"provideseducationalandinformationapl rogrammingto theNation's citizens."63On the Court'sview, however,these statementsdid not show that the law was content-basedT.heacknowledgmenotf certainvirtuesof broadcast programmingdid not mean that Congressenactedthe legislation because it regarded broadcast programming as substantively preferable to cable programming. 
Fourth,the Courtsaid thatstrictjudicial scrutinywas not requiredby the fact that the provisions (a) compel speech by cable operators,(b) favor broadcastprogrammersover cable programmersa,nd (c) single out certain members of the press for disfavoredtreatment.MThe fact that speech was mandatedwas irrelevantbecausethe mandatewas content-neutraalndbecause sortmightbe legitimate,see infratextaccompanyingnotes77-82 (discussingJusticeO'Connor'sanalysis), but thereis of course a presumptionagainstit. 
cable operatorswould not be forcedto altertheirown messages to respondto the broadcastsignals. So too, the Courtsaid that a speaker-basedregulation would not face special judicial hostility so long as it was content-neutralI.t was importantin this regardthatthe regulationof this particularindustrywas based on the special characteristicsof thatindustry-in short,"thebottleneck monopolypowerexercisedby cableoperatorsandthedangersthispowerposes to the viabilityof broadcasttelevision."6I5n such a case, the Courtconcluded, legislative selectivity would be acceptable. 
These conclusions are also of special importancefor the future. They reinforcethe pointthatCongressmay favorsome industriesover others.They also suggest thatCongressmay compelcompaniesto give access to speakers, at least so long as (a) the companiesthemselves are permittedto offer the messages they favor and (b) the access rights are given out on a contentneutralbasis. The TurnerCourtstressedthe governmentalgoal of ensuring access to free programmingfor viewers;but in upholdingthe Act, it also said thatit was legitimateto requireaccess forspeakers,so long as the requirement of contentneutralitywas met. 
Finally, the Court explored the question whether the must-carryrules would be acceptableas content-neutrarlegulationsof speech. Content-neutral regulationsmay well be invalid if they fail a kind of balancingtest.66The Courtconcludedthat "intermediatescrutiny"would be applied.67The Court said the appropriatetest, drawing on familiar cases,68would involve an exploration whether the regulation furthers an important or substantial governmentinterestandwhetherthe restrictionon FirstAmendmentfreedoms is no greaterthan necessaryto promotethat governmentinterest.The Court hadno difficultyin findingthreesubstantialinterests:(a) preservingfree local television, (b) promotingthe widespreaddisseminationof informationfroma multiplicityof sources, and (c) promotingfair competitionin the marketfor television programming.69On the Court's view, each of these was both importantand legitimate. 
What is of particularinterest is the fact that interests (a) and (b) are connectedwith Madisonianaspirations.Thusin an especially significantstep, the Courtsuggestedthata content-neutraelffortto promotediversitymay well be justified.In its most straightforwaredndorsementof the Madisonianview, the Court said that "assuringthat the public has access to a multiplicityof informationsources is a governmentalpurpose of the highest order,for it 
importantgovernmentinterestand be narrowlytailoredto achieve thatinterest). 
promotes values central to the First Amendment."70Hence the Court expressedspecial concern,in a perhapsself-consciousecho of RedLion, over the cable operator's "gatekeeper[]control over most (if not all) of the television programmingthat is channeledinto the subscriber'shome."71The Courtalso emphasized"[t]hepotentialfor abuseof this privatepower over a central avenue of communication"7.2 It stressed that the First Amendment "does not disable the governmentfrom taking steps to ensure that private interests not restrict, through physical control of a critical pathway of communication,the free flow of informationand ideas."73 
On the otherhand,the Courtthoughtthatit was impossibleto decide the case without a betterfactual recordthan had been developed thus far.74As it stood, the record was insufficient to show whetherthe must-carryrules would serve these legitimateinterests.Wouldlocal broadcastersactuallybe jeopardized without the must-carryrules? Here we should return to the possibility,of which the Courtwas surelyaware,thatthe rules were really an effort to favor the broadcastingindustry,not to help viewers. 
The Court suggested that courts should maintain a basic posture of deferenceto Congress'predictivejudgments.75In its view, judges shouldnot second-guessthose judgmentseven if they distrustthem. On the otherhand, Congress' judgments would face a form of independentjudicial review, designed to ensurethat Congresshad made "reasonableinferencesbased on substantialevidence."76The Courtthereforeremandedthe case to the lower court for factual findingson (a) the questionwhethercable operatorswould refuse significantnumbersof broadcaststationswithoutthe must-carryrules and (b) the question whetherbroadcaststations, if denied carriage,would deteriorateto a substantialdegreeor fail altogether. 
JusticeO'Connor'sdissentingopinion,joined by threeotherJustices,also deserves some discussion, since the opinion may have considerablefuture importancein view of the obviousinternalfragmentationof the Courton these questions.JusticeO'Connorinsistedabove all thatthe must-carryrules were based on content.77To reachthis conclusion,she investigatedthe Act and its historyto show thatthe nominallyneutralmeasureswere in fact designedto promote local programming. In her view, the existence of content discriminationwas not decisive against the must-carryrules. It was still necessaryto see whetherthe governmentcouldbringforwarda stronginterest, 
for this reason.See id. at 2473. 
and show that the regulationpromotedthat interest.But Justice O'Connor found thatthe governmentcould not meet its burden. 
In Justice O'Connor'sview, the interestin "localism"was insufficient justification.78In words that have considerablebearingon what government may do with any informationsuperhighway: 
It is for private speakersand listeners, not for the government,to decide what fractionof theirnews and entertainmenotught to be of a local characterand what fraction ought to be of a national (or international)one. And the same is trueof the interestin diversityof viewpoints: While the governmentmay subsidize speakers that it thinksprovidenovel pointsof view, it may not restrictotherspeakers on the theorythatwhat they say is moreconventional.79 
JusticeO'Connorreferredindependentlyto the interestsin public-affairs programmingand educationalprogramming,findingthat these interestsare "somewhatweightier"thanthe interestin localism. But in her view, "it is a difficult question whetherthey are compelling enough to justify restricting other sorts of speech."80Because of the difficulty of that question, Justice O'Connordid not say whether"theGovernmentcouldset some channelsaside for educationalor news programming."8(This is of coursea centralissue for the future.) 
In her view, the Act was too crudely tailored to be justified as an educational or public-affairs measure. The Act did not neutrally favor educationalor public-affairsprogrammings,ince it burdenedequally "CNN, C-Span, the Discovery Channel,the New InspirationalNetwork, and other channelswith as muchclaim as PBS to being educationalor relatedto public affairs."82Whether or not a neutrallaw favoring educationaland publicaffairsprogrammingcould surviveconstitutionalscrutiny,this Act could not, for it was insufficientlyneutral. 

I have noted that there have been two free speech traditionsand two principal models of free speech. The marketplacemodel eschews content regulation; it is animated by the notion of consumer sovereignty. The Madisonianmodel may permit and even welcome content regulation;it is rooted in an understandingof political sovereignty.There is now a third model-the Turnermodel-of what governmentmay do. An interesting question,not fully resolvedby Turneritself, hasto do with the extentto which the Turnermodel will incorporatefeaturesof its predecessors. 
The new model has four simple components. Under Turner, (a) governmentmay regulate(not merelysubsidize)new speech sourcesso as to ensureaccess for viewerswho would otherwisebe withoutfree programming and (b) governmentmay requireownersof speech sourcesto provideaccess to speakers, at least if the owners are not conventionalspeakerstoo; but (c) governmentmust do all this on a content-neutrablasis (at least as a general rule);but (d) governmentmay supportits regulationnot only by referenceto the provisionof "accessto free televisionprogramming"but also by invoking suchdemocraticgoals as the needto ensure"anoutletfor exchangeon matters of local concern"and "accessto a multiplicityof informationsources."83 
Remarkablye,veryJusticeon the Courtappearedto accept(a), (b), and(c) and partsof (d) (with minorqualifications)P.erhapsthe most notablefeature of the Court'sopinionis its emphasison the legitimacyandthe importanceof ensuringgeneralpublic (viewer)access to free programmingI.n this way, the Courtaccepted at least a modest aspect of the Madisonianideal, connected with both political equality and broad disseminationof information.This generalgoal is likely to have continuingimportancein governmentalefforts to control the informationsuperhighwayso as to ensureviewer and listener access. The TurnerCourthas putits stampof approvalon thatgoal. Recall in particularthatthe governmentjustifiedthe must-carryruleson the theorythat without those rules, ordinarybroadcasterswould be unableto survive. The consequence would be that people without cable would be without broadcastingat all. The Courtenthusiasticallyacceptedthis claim. It said that "to preserve access to free television programmingfor the 40 percent of Americanswithout cable" was a legitimateinterest.84This holding suggests thatthe governmentmay provideaccess not only throughsubsidies,but also throughregulation. 
On the otherhand,the Court'squite odd refusal85to distinguishbetween sections4 and 5 andits use of the presumptionagainstcontentdiscrimination seem to supportthe marketplacemodel. Certainlythe Courtdid not say that it would be receptiveto contentdiscriminationif the discriminationwere an effort to promoteattentionto public affairsand exposureto diverse sources. The Court did not claim or in any way imply that educationaland publicaffairsprogrammingcouldbe requiredconsistentlywiththe FirstAmendment. On the contrary,it suggestedthat it would view any contentdiscrimination, including content discrimination having these goals, with considerable skepticism.The result is a large degree of confusionwith respectto whether andhow governmentmaypromoteMadisonianaspirationsI. will returnto this point. 
The Court's major internaldispute involved the question whether the content neutrality of the must-carryrules was impeached by the history suggesting that Congress was particularly enthusiastic about local programming.This is an issue on which reasonablepeople may disagree;it turnslargely on the extent to which statementsin the legislative historywill be used to cast light on legislative goals. But the issue of content discriminationseems, on inspection, to rest on a matternot discussed by anyone on the Court;it is principallythat matter,not the legislative history, thatraises special issues aboutcontentdiscrimination. 
Moreconcretely:Fromthe standpointof traditionaflree speechargument, there is an obvious problemwith the analysis offered by the TurnerCourt. Section 4 and section 5 are quite different;they appearto have different justifications.In any case, differentcarriagerequirementsin the two sections, targeted to two different kinds of broadcasting,plainly reveal content discriminationT.he two sectionsexplicitlydefinetheircorrelativeobligations in termsof the nature,or content,of theprogrammingT.his is proofof content discrimination. 
How shouldthatdiscriminationbe handled?Underthe Madisonianview, there is all the differencein the worldbetween section 4 and section 5. As I havenoted,section5 imposescertaincarriagerequirementfsoreducationaland public-affairs stations, whereas section 4 imposes different carriage requirementsfor commercialstations.ForMadisonians,section5 standson far stronger ground, since it is apparentlyan effort to ensure education and attention to public issues. It seems to serve straightforwarddemocratic functions.This does not meanthatit is necessarilylegitimate.PerhapsJustice O'Connor'sresponse-to theeffect thatsection5 does not adequatelypromote thatgoal-is decisive as againsta Madisoniandefenseof section5. But section 4 appearsto standon farweakergroundfromtheMadisonianstandpointT.hus Madisonianswould distinguishbetweenthe two provisionsand would be far more hospitable toward section 5.86 
In fact, the Courtshouldhave analyzedthe two sections differently.The validity of section 4 turnedon whetherthe factualrecordcould supportthe Broadcasting and the Future of Cable Regulation, 17 HASTINGSCOMM.& ENT. L.J. 65, 91-95 (1994), for an argument that on remand, the district court should uphold section 5 even if it finds section 4 unconstitutional. 
Technologicaldevelopmentsenjoyedby so manypeople bringwith them extraordinarypromise and opportunities from the standpoints of both Madisonianism and the marketplace.From nearly108any point of view, nostalgiafor preexistingspeech marketsmakeslittle sense. 
The economic point is obvious,for the costs of transacting-of obtaining information and entering into mutually beneficial deals-will decrease enormously,and hence it will be mucheasierfor consumersto get what they want, whateverit is that they want. To say the least, a shoppingtrip-for groceries,books, medicines,housing,trialtranscriptsc,lothing-will be much simplerthan it now is; it may well be significantlysimplernow than it was when this Essay was first written.'09In these ways the new information technologies are a greatboon. 
At the same time, and equally important,there are potentialdemocratic gains, since communicationamong citizens and between citizens and their representativeswill be far easier.Citizensmay be able to expresstheirviews to public officials andto receive answersmoreeffectively.To statea view or ask a question on the issue of the day, no town meeting need be arranged. High-quality, substantive discussions may well be possible among large numbersof people;townmeetingsthataregenuinelydeliberativemay become commonplace.Votingmay occurthroughthe Internet.This is one of the most intriguingfeaturesof cyberspace.11I0t will be possible to obtaina greatdeal of informationaboutcandidatesandtheirpositions. 
In fact much of this has alreadyoccurred.The practiceof journalismhas changed in the sense that reporterscommunicateregularlywith readers.1"1 Before the 1994 elections, public librarycomputersdelivered considerable informationaboutthe candidatesvia the WorldWide Web of the Internet.112 The Web also allows people to see photographsof candidatesand to have access to dozens of pages of informationaboutthem andtheirpositions.The Webmay be used nationallyfor these purposesas earlyas 1996. A numberof elected officials-in the White House, the Senate,andthe House-now have e-mail addressesand communicatewith theirconstituentsin cyberspace. 
In Minnesota,five candidatesfor governorand three candidatesfor the senate participatedin debates on electronic mail.113 In 1993, President Clinton established connections with millions of e-mail users, putting his addressinto theirsystem andinvitingthemto give reactionson public issues. Candidatesgenerallyare obtainingand publicizinge-mail addresses.114Thus presidentialcandidateLamarAlexanderlaunchedhis campaignwith a forum via America Online, in which he spoke to all those who chose to join the forum.11'The Madisonianframeworkwas based partly on the assumption that large-scale substantive discussions would not be practicable.116 Technologymay well renderthatassumptionanachronistic. 
The result may be of particularbenefit for people of moderateor low income. People withoutsubstantialmeansmay nonethelessmaketheirviews heard. So too relativelypoor candidatesmay be able to communicatemore cheaply.117In this way the new communicationstechnologies may relieve some of the pressure for campaign finance restrictionsby promotingthe Madisoniangoal of political equality.118In the midst of economic inequality, perhapstechnological advancescan make political equality a more realistic goal. 119 
Moreover,educationaboutpublicissueswill be muchsimplerandcheaper. The government,andrelevantinterestgroups,will be able to statetheircases far moreeasily. And aftertouchinga few buttons,people will be able to have access to substantialinformationabout policy dilemmas-possible wars, environmentarlisksandregulationsl,egaldevelopmentst,rials,medicalreform, anda good deal more.Consideras simplyone example,the astonishingservice LEXIS Counsel Connect. With this service a lawyer can have access to essentially all proposedlaws. A lawyer can also join substantive"discussion groups,"dealingwith,forexample,the Simpsontrial,recenttax developments, risk regulation, securities arbitration,affirmative action, LEXIS Counsel Connect,cyberspace,theFirstAmendmentin cyberspace,andmuchmore.The proliferationof law-relateddiscussiongroupson law-relatedtopics is one tiny illustrationof a remarkableculturaldevelopment.Thus the Usenet includes morethan 10,000 discussiongroups,dealingwith particlephysics, ring-tailed lemurs,and Rush Limbaugh,amongcountlessothers.120

"bottom-up"quality.In contrastto the mass media, in which a large broadcasterspeaks to millions, the Internetallows individualcitizens to spreadnews or commentaryto one person, or to hundreds,or to thousands,or to millions. The problem of access to the media is in this respect greatly reduced. A 
At least from the standpointof the foundingera, andfrom the standpoint of democratictheory,the new technologyalso carrieswith it significantrisks. There are two majorproblems.The first is an absence of deliberation.The second is an increasein social balkanization. 
a. Absence of Deliberation 
The Madisonian view of course places a high premium on public deliberation, and it disfavors immediate and inadequately considered governmentalreactions to pressures from the citizenry1.21 The American polity is a republic,not a directdemocracy,andfor legitimatereasons;direct democracyis unlikelyto providesuccessfulgovernance,for it is too likely to be free from deliberationandundulysubjectto short-timereactionsandsheer manipulation.Fromthe inceptionof the Americansystem a largepoint of the system of republicanismhas been to "refineand enlarge the public view" throughthe system of representation.122 
This process of refinementand enlargementis endangeredby decreased costs of communication.As I have noted,discussionsin cyberspacemay well be both substantive and deliberative;electronic mail and the Internet in particular hold out considerable promise on this score.123 But communicationsbetweencitizensandtheirrepresentativemsayalsobe reactive to short-term impulses, and may consist of simple referenda results insufficientlyfilteredby reflectionand discussion. 
In the currentperiod,thereis thus a seriousrisk thatlow-cost or costless communicationwill increasegovernment'sresponsivenessto myopicorpoorly consideredpublicoutcries,or to sensationalisticor sentimentalanecdotesthat are a poor basis for governance.Althoughthe apparentpresence of diverse public voices is often celebrated,electoralcampaignsandtreatmentof public issues already suffer from myopia and sensationalism,124and in a way that compromises founding ideals. On this count it is hardly clear that new technologies will improvematters.They may even make things worse. The phenomenonof "talkradio"has achievedconsiderableattentionin this regard. It is surely desirableto provideforumsin which citizens can speakWithone decentralizedsystem has the distinctvirtueof promotingJeffersonianaspirationsto citizenship.

But it is not desirable if government officials are reactingto immediatereactionsto misleadingor sensationalistic presentationsof issues. 
Ross Perot's conception of an "electronic town meeting" is hardly consistentwith foundingaspirations,at least if the meetinghas the power to makedecisions all by itself. Democracyby soundbiteis hardlya perfectideal. New technologies may make democracy by soundbite far more likely. Everythingdependson how thosetechnologiesaredeployedin communicating to public officials. 
We can makethese pointsmorevivid with a thoughtexperiment.Imagine that throughthe new technologies, the communicationsoptions were truly limitless. Each personcould design his own communicationsuniverse.Each person could see those things that he wantedto see, and only those things. Insulationfrom unwelcome materialwould be costless. Choice of particular subjectsand points of view would be costless too. Wouldsuch a system be a communicationsutopia?Wouldit fulfill FirstAmendmentaspirations?125 
The answeris by no meanssimple.Of coursea systemof this kindwould have advantages.It might well overcomesome of the problemsproducedby extremes of wealth and poverty,at least insofar as poor people could both speak and hearfar more cheaply.But the aspirationto an informedcitizenry may not be well served.Underthe hypothesizedsystem,perhapsmost people would be rarelyor poorlyinformed.Perhapstheirconsumptionchoices would disserve democraticideals.126If the system of free expressionis designedto ensureagainstan "inertpeople,"we cannotknow,a priori, whethera system of well-functioningfree marketswould be desirable. 
b. Balkanizationand Self-Insulation 
The hypothesizedsystem would have anotherproblem:It would allow people to screenout ideas, facts, or accountsof facts thatthey finddisturbing. In the currentsystem, people are often confrontedwith ideas and facts that they find uncongenial. This is an importantdemocraticgood; it promotes educationanddiscussion.A well-functioningsystemof free expressionis one in which people areexposedto ideasthatcompetewith theirown, so thatthey can test their own views and understandotherperspectiveseven when they disagree.This processcan producea capacityfor empathyandunderstanding, so that other people are not dehumanizedeven across sharpdifferences in judgmentandperspective.Importanftormsof commonalityandrespectmight emerge simply by virtueof presentingthe perspectivesof othersfrom others' points of view. 

A system of individually designed communicationsoptions could, by contrast,result in a high degree of balkanization,in which people are not presentedwith new or contraryperspectives.Such a nationcould not easily satisfy democraticand deliberativegoals. In such a nation, communication among people with differentperspectivesmight be far more difficult than it now is; mutualintelligibilitymaybecomedifficultor even impossible.In such a nation, there may be little commonality among people with diverse commitments,as one groupcaricaturesanotheror understandsit by meansof simple slogans thatdebaserealityand eliminatemutualunderstanding. 
These suggestionsarefarfromhypotheticalT.heycapturea significantpart of the reality of currentcommunicationsin America. They create serious political risks. 
It is farfromclearhow governmentcan or shouldovercomethese various problems. Certainlygovernmentshould not be permittedto censor citizen efforts to communicatewith representatives,even if such communications carryrisksto deliberativeideals.It does seemclear,however,thatgovernment shouldbe cautiousaboutspurringon its own the use of new technologiesto promoteimmediate,massive public reactionsto popularissues. Government by referendum is at best a mixed blessing, with possible unfortunate consequenceswhereverit is tried.12T7he electronicmedia shouldnot be used to createa formof governmentby referendumR.egulatoryeffortsto facilitate communicationneed not be transformedinto an effortto abandonrepublican goals. 
Ratherthan spurringreferendain cyberspace,or referendaby soundbite, governmentshould seek to promotedeliberationandreflectionas partof the process of eliciting popularopinion.28 Any such efforts might well be made part of a general strategyfor turningnew communicationstechnologies to constitutionalends. As we have seen,electronicmailhas considerablepromise on this score. 
A large questionfor both constitutionalaw and public policy has yet to receive a full democraticor a judicial answer:To what extent, if any, do Madisonian ideals have a place in the world of new technologies, or in cyberspace?Some people think that the absence of scarcity eliminates the 
DELIBERATION1-2, 84 (1991). argumentfor governmentalregulation,at least if it is designed to promote attentionto publicissues, to increasediversity,or to raisethe qualityof public debate.'29If outlets are unlimited,why is regulationof any value? In the future,people will be able to listen to whateverthey want, perhapsto speak to whomeverthey choose. Oughtthis not to be a constitutionalideal? 
The questionis meantto answeritself, but perhapsenoughhas been said to show thatit hardlydoes that.Recallfirstthatstructurarlegulation,assigning propertyrights and making agreementspossible, is a preconditionfor wellfunctioningmarkets.Laissez-faireis a hopelessmisdescriptionof free markets. A large governmentrole, with coercive features, is requiredto maintain markets. Part of the role also requires steps to prevent monopoly and monopolisticpractices. 
Moreover,Madisoniangoals neednot be thoughtanachronisticin a period of infinite outlets. In a system of infinite outlets, the goal of consumer sovereigntymay well be adequatelypromoted.Thatgoal has a distinguished place in both law and public policy. But it should not be identifiedwith the Constitution's free speech guarantee. The Constitution does not require consumersovereignty;for the most part,the decision whetherto qualify or replacethatgoal with Madisonianaspirationsshouldbe madedemocratically rather than judicially. A democraticcitizenry armed with a constitutional guaranteeof free speechneednot see consumersovereigntyas its fundamental aspiration.13C0ertainlyit may choose consumersovereigntyif it likes. But it may seek instead to ensure high-qualityfare for children, even if this approachdepartsfrom consumersatisfaction.It may seek more generallyto promoteeducationaland public-affairsprogramming.

The experience of the Bundesverfassungsgericht(GermanConstitutionalCourt)is of special interest,for the Court has selfconsciously decidedthatdemocraticaspirationsrequirethe governmentto regulatethe broadcastmediato create a forum for speakerswith a broadrange of interestsand opinions.

It is commonly thought that viewers and listeners purchase a communicationsproduct,andthattheirpurchasedecisionsshouldbe respected; but this pictureis not altogetherright.The decisions of viewers and listeners are differentfrom most consumptiondecisions, in the sense thatviewers and listenersoftenpay nothingforprogramminga,ndoftenthey are,in a sense, the productthatis being sold. For muchcommercialprogramminga, key source of revenuesis advertisers,andprogrammersdeliverviewers to advertisersin returnfor money.Forthisreasonthebroadcastingmarketis not a conventional one in which people purchasetheirpreferredproducts.People's viewing and listening time is boughtand sold. 
There is an important consequence for the substantive content of broadcasting:What is providedin a communicationsmarketis not the same as what viewers would like to see. Advertisershave some power over the content of communication, for they may withdraw their support from disfavoredprogrammingT.heymaywithdrawtheirsupportnot simplybecause the programming does not attract viewers, but also because (a) the programmingis critical of the particularadvertisers,(b) it is critical of commerceis general,(c) it stirsup a controversialreactionfrom some partof the audience, or (d) it is "depressing"or creates "an unfavorablebuying atmosphere."There is a great deal of evidence that advertisercontrol does affect the content of programming."3C' ontroversialprogramshave been punished; presentationsof contested issues, such as abortion, have been affectedby advertisers'goals.132 
In an era of numerous options, the influence of advertising over programmingcontentshouldbe less troublesome,since controversialpointsof view shouldfindan outlet.Certainlythereis no suchproblemon the Internet. But therewill nonethelesscontinueto be a structuraplroblemin broadcasting markets,since viewers' demandfor programswill not be fully responsiblefor theprogramsthatareactuallyprovided.Manyimaginableproposalscouldhelp counterthisproblem.Suchproposalsshouldnotbe foundunconstitutionaelven if consumersovereigntyis the overridingpolicy goal.'33 
If we put the questionsraisedby advertisersto one side, we might urge thatthereis a decisive argumentin favorof the marketplacemodelandagainst Madisonianism. The marketplace ideal values "choice," whereas the 12, at 62-66. 
Madisonianalternativecan be seen to reflecta formof dangerouspaternalism, or disrespectfor people's diversejudgmentsabout entertainmentoptions.'34 PerhapsMadisonianismis illiberalinsofar as it does not respect the widely divergentconceptionsof the good thatare reflectedin consumptionchoices. 
The argumentis certainlyplausible.In mostarenas,consumersareallowed to choose as they wish, and governmentalinterferencerequires special justification.But in this context, at least, the argumentfrom choice is quite unconvincing,for it wronglytakespeople's consumptionchoices as definitive or exhaustiveof "choice."In fact the notionof "choice"is a complex one that admits of no such simple understanding.'3I5n a democraticsociety, people makechoices as citizens too. They makechoices in democraticarenasas well as in storesandbeforetheircomputers.Whatthosechoices aredependson the context in which they are made. 
For this reason,the insistenceon respectfor "choice,"as a defense of the marketplacemodel, sets up the legal problem in a question-beggingway. People do make choices as consumers,and these choices should perhapsbe respected. But those choices are heavily geared to the particularsetting in whichthey aremade-programmingconsumptionT.heydo notrepresentsome acontextual entity called "choice." In fact there is no such acontextual entity. 
The questionis not whetheror not to respect"choice,"but what sorts of choices to respect. More particularly,the question is whether to allow democraticchoices to makeinroadson consumptionchoices. In a free society, consumptionchoices shouldusuallybe respected.ButtheConstitutiondoes not requirethis result, and in some settings democraticjudgments contraryto consumption choices are legitimate. For example, a requirement that broadcastersprovidefree mediatime for candidatesmightwell receive broad publicsupport,even if viewerswould,at the relevanttime, opt for commercial programming."37There should be no constitutional barrier to such a requirement. 
The centralpoint is thatin theircapacityas citizens assessingthe speech market,people may well make choices, or offer consideredjudgments,that diverge from their choices as consumers.138Acting through their elected representativest,he publicmaywell seek to promote(forexample)educational KRATrENMAKER& POWE,supra note 25.

Preferencesand Politics, 20 PHIL.& PUB. AFF. 3 (1991). programming,attention to public issues, and diverse views. Perhaps the public-or a majorityactingin its democraticcapacity-believes thateducation and discussionof public issues are bothindividualand collective goods. Any system of expressionhas culturalconsequences;it helps createand sustaina certain kind of culture. Perhapsthe public wants to ensure a culture of a certain sort, notwithstandingconsumptionchoices.139Perhaps it seeks to protectchildrenandadolescents,andsees regulationof broadcastingas a way of accomplishingthatgoal. Perhapspeoplebelieve thattheirown consumption choices are less thanideal, andthatforjustice-regardingor altruisticreasons, orbecauseof theirbasiccommitmentsandjudgments,regulationsshouldforce broadcastersor cable operatorsto improveon existing low-qualityfare. 
Perhapspeople seek andhencechoose to ensuresomethinglike a political community,not in the sense of a place where everyone believes the same thing, but in the sense of a polity in which people are generallyawareof the issues that are important o the futureof the polity.Perhapspeople thinkthat thebroadcastingmediashouldhave a degreeof continuitywiththe educational system, in the sense that broaddisseminationof knowledge and exposureto different views are part of what citizens in a democraticpolity deserve. Perhapspeople believe that many citizens do not value certainhigh-quality programmingpartlybecause they have not been exposed to it, and perhaps experimentsare designedto see if tastesfor such programmingcan be fueled throughexposure.140 
Wouldmeasuresstimulatedby suchthoughtsbe objectionablei,llegitimate, or even unconstitutional?Wouldthey interferein an impermissibleway with somethingcalled "choice"?I do not believe so. Surelyany sucheffortsshould be policed by courts, so as to ensurethat governmentis not discriminating againstor in favor of certainviewpoints.The mere fact that the democratic majorityseeks to overcomeconsumptionchoices is not legitimatingby itself; the democratic judgment may be unacceptableif it involves viewpoint discriminationor content discriminationsuggestive of viewpoint bias. But rightlyconceived,ourconstitutionahleritagedoes notdisablethepublic,acting throughtheconstitutionaclhannels,fromimprovingtheoperationof the speech market in the ways that I have-suggested. Whetherit should do so is a questionto be answereddemocraticallyratherthanjudicially.

An importantissue forthe futureinvolvestheuse of old analogiesin novel settings. The new technologies will greatly increase the opportunitiesfor intrusive, fraudulent,harassing,threatening,libelous, or obscene speech.141 Witha few brieftouchesof a finger,a speakeris now be ableto communicate to thousandsor even millions of people-or to pinpointa message,perhapsa commercial,harassing,threateninginvasivemessage,to a particularperson.A libelous message, or grotesque invasions of privacy, can be sent almost costlessly. Perhaps reputationsand lives will be easily ruined or at least damaged.Therearedifficultquestionsaboutthe extentto which an ownerof a computerservice mightbe held liable for what appearson that service.142 
At this stage, it remainsunclearwhetherthe conventionallegal standards should be alteredto meet such problems.For the most part,those standards generallyseem an adequatestartandmustsimplybe adaptedto new settings. For purposesof assessing cyberspace,thereareoften apt analogieson which to draw.In fact the legal culturehas no way to thinkaboutthe new problems except via analogies.The analogiesare built into our very language:e-mail, electronicbulletinboards,cyberspace,cyberspaces,'43and much more.1" 
Thus, for example, ordinarymail provides a promisingfoundationon which to build the assessmentof legal issues associatedwith electronicmail. It is farfromclearthatthe standardsfor libelousor fraudulentcommunication must shift with the new technologies. To be sure, there will be new and somewhatvexing occasions for evaluatingthe old standardsJ.udgesmay not understandthe novel situations,especially those involving the Internet.In particular,the low cost of sending and receiving electronic mail, and of sending it to thousands or millions of people, may produce some new developmentsandputhighpressureon old categories.Certainlyit is likelythat new and unanticipatedproblemswill ariseanda degreeof judicialcautionis thereforedesirablein invokingthe FirstAmendment.But it is by no means clear thatthe basic principleswill themselveshave to be muchchanged. 
I have noted thatthe governmenthas said that "universalaccess" is one of its goals for the informationsuperhighway.The question of access has several dimensions. To some extent it is designed to ensure access to broadcastingoptionsfor viewersandlisteners-the centralproblemin Turner. Here a particularconcernis thatpoorpeople shouldnot be deprivedof access to a valuable good. Currently the expense of Internet connections is prohibitively high for many families. This may entail a form of disenfranchisementand to some extent the problemis to ensure access for certainspeakerswho wantto reachpartof the viewing or listeningpublic.In cyberspace,of course, people areboth listenersand speakers. 
Perhapsthe goal of universalviewer or listeneraccess shouldbe viewed with skepticism.The governmentdoes not guaranteeuniversalaccess to cars, or housing, or food, or even healthcare.It may seem puzzlingto suggestthat universalaccess to informationtechnologiesis an importantsocial goal. But the suggestioncan be shown to be less puzzlingthanit appears.Suppose,for example, that a certainnetworkbecomes a principalmeans by which people communicate with their elected representatives; suppose that such communicationsbecomea principalpartof publicdeliberationandin thatway ancillaryto the rightto vote. Supposetoo thatcompaniesengage in a formof "electronicredlining,"in whichtheybypasspoorerareas,bothruralandin the inner city.145We know that a poll tax is unconstitutionalbecause of its harmful effects on political equality.16 On a broadly similar principle, universalaccess to the networkmightbe thoughtdesirable.To be sure, such access would be most unlikelyto be constitutionallymandated,since the right to vote is technicallynot involved. But universalaccess could be seen to be partof the goal of political equality.More generally,universalaccess might be necessary if the networkis to serve its intendedfunction of promoting broaddiscussionbetweencitizensandrepresentativesI.t is notablethatat least seven million Americans,most of whom arepoor,lack telephones,andhence are withoutbasic access.147 
The point might be generalized.For any particularspeaker,part of the advantage of having access to a certain means of communicationis that everyone,or almosteveryone,or a wide rangeof people,can be reached.The Postal Service, for example, is justifiedin parton the groundthat a national systemof mail is necessaryor at leasthelpfulfor thosewho sendmail;we can be assuredthatany lettercan reacheveryone.The claim is controversial.But perhaps a requirementof universal access can be justified not as an inefficient"48effort to subsidize people who would be without service, but on the quite differentgroundthatuniversalservice is a way of promotingthe at 25, 26. 

access. communicativeinterestsof thosewho alreadyhave service.The interestsof the lattergroupmay well be promotedby ensuringthatthey can reacheveryone, or nearlyeveryone. 
Arguments of this kind have been used throughoutthe history of telecommunicationsregulation.For most of the twentiethcentury,therehave been cross-subsidies,as local companieswith local monopolieshave charged high prices to certain customers (usually businesses) with which they subsidizedless profitableservices.Perhapsa similarmodel would makesense for moderntechnologies. The issue is alreadyreceiving considerablepublic attention.149 
There are, however, significant inefficiencies in this model of crosssubsidization,150and a system of open-endedcompetitionmay well be better thanone basedon universalaccess.It maybe thatopen-endedcompetitionwill provideuniversalaccess in any case, or somethingvery close to it. Or it may be thatopen-endedcompetition,combinedwith selective subsidies,would be betterthanthe regulatoryapproach.This questioncannoteasily be answered in the abstract.Certainlydebateover universalaccess shouldnot be resolved by constitutionalfiat. This is an areafor public debateand a large degree of experimentation. 
In general, any regulatorycontrols should take the form of flexible incentives ratherthan rigid commands.Command-and-controslystems are usuallyineffectivein achievingtheirown goals;they tendto promoteinterestgroup power, in which well-organized private groups are able to use governmentalauthorityto redistributewealth or opportunitiesin their favor; they also tend to be inefficient.151 
I cannot discuss this issue in detail here, but the explosion of new technologiesreinforcesthe point.It is predictablethatownersof some services will attemptto obtain governmentalaid to disadvantageactual or potential competitors.152 Especially in an era of rapid and only partly foreseeable technologicalchange,the government'sbasic duty is to providea framework for competitive development,153ratherthan specificationof end-states.Any

This is not to say that governmentregulationhas no place, or even that government should restrict itself to the task of ensuring well-functioning markets.But even good Madisoniansshouldinsist thatrigid dictatesoughtto be avoided. Regulationwill do far better if it takes the form of incentives ratherthanmandates.Consider,as possible forerunnersof futureapproaches, the FCC'suse of auctionsystemsaccompaniedby the grantof "points"toward licensing'54 for preferredlicensees. Consider too the use of government subsidies to public broadcastingor to certainhigh-qualityprograms,or the transfer of resources from commercial broadcastersfor the benefit of noncommercial,educational,or public-affairsprogrammingI.nitiativesof this sortwould not mandateparticularresultsbutinsteadwouldcreatepressuresto improvethe speech market. 
C. Law 
The ultimate shape of constitutionalconstraintson regulation of the electronic media cannot be foreseen. Too many new possibilities will come into view. Too manydistinctionswill becomerelevant.Consider,for example, the fact that for many dozens of years, there has been a clear difference between two different kinds of communication. The first is ordinary broadcastingor publishing,in whichan ownermakesavailablea certainrange of communications;offers that range of communicationsas an indivisible package for hundreds, thousands, or millions of subscribers;and sells advertisingtime for commercialinterests.The second involves the mail, in which one persontypicallysendsa messageto another,or in whichone person might send a message to a groupof people;in any case mail involves highly differentiated,ratherthan indivisible, communication,in the sense that no single "package"is made availableto wide rangesof people. Moreover,no advertisersneed be involved. Many of the complexities in free speech law have arisenfromthis distinction,thoughthe implicationsof the distinctionare of course sharplycontested. 
New technologiesmay weakenor even undothe distinctionbetweenthese two categories.In the long-termfuture,the "mail"analogy may become the more apposite one, as it becomes simplerand cheaperfor a personto send communicationsto any particularperson,or to a large group of people, on such terms as he chooses. Communicationsmay decreasinglycome in an indivisiblepackage,andincreasinglytaketheparticularformthattheparticular actorschoose. Perhapsin the future,"broadcastingw"ill increasinglyhavethis women applicants.See JohnMcMillan,Selling SpectrumRights,J. ECONP.ERSP.,Summer1994, at 145. characteristic.Often the purchaserof the relevantinformationwill pay for it without the intermediation of advertisers.'55In such a future, the constitutionalissues will takeon differentdimensions.A key questionwill be the extentto whichthe owneror managerof the "mail"may be held liable for injuriesthatoccuras a resultof use of some service.It will be plausibleto say thatjust as the United States and FederalExpressare not liable for harms causedby packagesthey carry,so too the ownerof an electronicserviceought not to pay damagesfor harmsthatownerscannotreasonablybe expected to preventor control.But it is far too soon to offer particularjudgmentson the issues that will arise. 
It is nonethelesspossible to describecertaincategoriesof regulationand to set out some generalguidelinesabouthow theymightbe approachedI. have suggested that existing law provides principlesand analogies on which it makes sense to draw. An exploration of new problems confirms this suggestion. It shows that current categories can be invoked fairly straightforwardlyto make sense of likely futuredilemmas. 
A largelesson mayemergefromthediscussion.Oftenparticipantsin legal disputes,andespeciallyin constitutionadlisputes,disagreesharplywithrespect to high-level,abstractissues;thedebatebetweenMadisoniansandmarketplace advocates is an obvious illustration.But sometimes such disputantscan converge,or narrowtheirdisagreementa greatdeal, by grapplingwith highly particularproblems.In otherwords, debateover abstractionsmay conceal a potential for productivediscussion and even agreementover particulars.156 Perhapsthis is a strategythroughwhichwe mightmakemuchprogressin the next generationof free speech law. 
Many actual and imaginablelegislative efforts are designed to ensure competitionin the new communicationsmarkets.There is no constitutional problemwith such efforts.'57The only qualificationis thatsome such efforts might be seen as subterfugefor content regulation,disguised by a claimed need to promote monopoly; but this should be a relatively rare event. If governmentis genuinelyattemptingto preventmonopolisticpractices,andto offer a structurein which competitioncan take place, there is no basis for constitutionalcomplaint.HereFirstAmendmenttheoristsof widely divergent views might be broughtinto agreement. 

competition). 
It is predictablethatgovernmentmightseek to assist certaintechnologies that offer great promise for the future.Some such efforts may in fact be a result of interest-grouppressure.But in general, there is no constitutional obstacleto governmenteffortsto subsidizepreferredcommunicationssources. Perhapsgovernmentbelievesthatsometechnologicalinnovationsareespecially likely to do well, or thatthey couldreceiveparticularlyvaluablebenefitsfrom national assistance. At least so long as there is no reason to believe that governmentis favoring speech of a certaincontent,efforts of this kind are unobjectionableas a matterof law.158They may be objectionableas a matter of policy, since governmentmay makebadjudgmentsreflectingconfusionor factionalinfluence;but thatis a differentissue. 
In her dissentingopinion in Turner,JusticeO'Connorsuggestedthatthe appropriateresponse to governmentdesire for programmingof a certain contentis not regulationbut insteadsubsidization.15T9his idea fits well with the basic model for campaign finance regulation, set out in Buckley v. Valeo.'60 It also fits with the idea, found in Rust v. Sullivan,161 that the governmentis unconstrainedin its powerto subsidizesuchspeechas it prefers. Hencethereshouldbe no constitutionaolbjectionto governmenteffortsto fund public broadcasting,to pay for high-qualityfare for children,or to support programmingthat deals with public affairs.'62Perhapsgovernmentmight do this for certainuses of the Internet. 
To be sure, it is doubtfulthatRustwould be takento its logical extreme. Couldthe governmentfundtheDemocraticConventionbutnottheRepublican Convention?Could the governmentannouncethat it would fund only those public-affairsprogramsthatspoke approvinglyof currentgovernmentpolicy? If we take the First Amendmentto ban viewpointdiscrimination,fundingof this kind should be held to be improperlymotivated.On the other hand, governmentsubsidiesof educationalandpublic-affairsprogrammingneed not 
governmentfunding of the Corporationfor Public Broadcastingand the National Endowmentfor the Humanities.In principle,such fundingis justifiedin light of the "publicgood" featuresof the relevant productsand in light of the possibility thatthe fundedsourcescan increaseopportunitiesfor preference formationby providinggreaterexposureto high-qualitymaterial.See ANDERSON,supra note 135, at 149. But the ultimatevalue of fundingdependson a rangeof morepracticaland empiricalissues thatcannot be decideda priori, includingthe actualproductsthatresult,the opportunitiesto provideprivatefunding instead,and the alternativeuse of governmentmoney. raise serious risks of viewpoint discrimination. It therefore seems unexceptionableforgovernments,hortof viewpointdiscriminationt,o subsidize those broadcasterswhose programmingit prefers,even if any suchpreference embodies content discrimination. So too, government might promote "conversations"or fora on e-mail thatinvolve issues of publicimportance,or that attemptto promoteeducationalgoals for childrenor even adults.163 
Not OtherwiseGet Carriage 
Suppose that a particularcommunicationscarrier has room for five hundredchannels;supposethatfourhundredchannelsarefilled, but thatone hundredare left open. Wouldit be legitimatefor governmentto say thatthe one hundredmustbe filled by stationsthatwould otherwisebe unablebe pay for carriage?Let us suppose that the stations would be chosen througha content-neutraslystem, such as a lottery.Fromthe FirstAmendmentpoint of view, this approachseems acceptable.The governmentwould be attempting to ensure access for speakerswho would otherwisebe unable to reach the audience.It is possible thatas a matterof policy, governmentshouldhave to providesome paymentto the carrierin returnfor the access requirementB.ut theredoes not seem to be a FirstAmendmentproblem. 

Stations,Filling Vacancieswith a LotterySystemor Timesharing In her dissenting opinion in Turner,Justice O'Connor suggested the possibility that carrierscould be requiredto set aside certainchannelsto be filled by a randommethod.64The advantageof this approachis thatit would promote access for people who would otherwise be denied carriage, but without involving governmentin decisions about preferredcontent. This approachshouldraise no FirstAmendmentdifficulties. 
ConventionalMarketFailure,But ToEnsure Universalor NearUniversalConsumerAccess to Networks 
The protection of broadcastersin Turnerwas specifically designed to ensure continued viewer access to free programming.Notably, the Court permittedgovernmentto achieve this goal throughregulationratherthan with elections). 
throughsubsidy.Of coursesubsidyis the simplerandordinarilymoreefficient route. If governmentwants to make sure that all consumershave access to communicationsnetworks,why shouldgovernmentnot be requiredto pay to allow such access, on a kind of analogueto the food stamp program?The ordinaryresponse to a problemof access is not to fix prices but insteadto subsidize people who would otherwisebe withoutaccess. The TurnerCourt apparentlybelieved thatit is constitutionallyacceptablefor the governmentto ensure that industry (and subscribers),ratherthan taxpayers, provide the fundingfor those who would otherwiselack access. 
The preciseimplicationsof this holdingremainto be seen. It is impossible to foresee the range of structuralregulationsthat might be proposedin an effortto ensurethatall or almostall citizenshave access to free programming or to some communicationsnetwork,includinganypartsof the "informational superhighway."Some such regulationsmight in fact be based on other,more invidious motives, such as favoritismtowarda particularset of suppliers;as we have seen, this may well be true of the measurein Turneritself. The Turner decision means that courts should review with some care any governmentalclaim thatregulationis actuallybased on an effort to promote free access. But the key pointhereis thatif the claim can be madeout on the facts, structuralregulationshouldbe found acceptable. 

Harassing Broadcastingor Messages 
New technologieshave greatlyexpandedthe opportunityto communicate obscene, libelous, violent, or harassingmessages-perhaps to generalgroups via stationson (for example)cable television,perhapsto particularpeople via electronic mail.'65Invasions of privacy are far more likely. The Internet poses special problemson these counts. As a generalrule, any restrictions should be treatedlike those governingordinaryspeech, with ordinarymail providingthe best analogy.If restrictionsarenarrowlytailored,andsupported by a sufficiently strongrecord,they shouldbe upheld. 
Considerin this regardthe highly publicizedcase involving "cyberporn" at the University of Michigan.166A studentis alleged to have distributeda fictional story involving a fellow student,explicitly named,who was, in the story, raped, tortured,and finally killed. The first question raised here is whetherstateor federallaw providesa causeof actionfor conductof this sort. Perhapsthe story amountsto a threat,or a form of libel, or perhapsthe most plausiblestatelaw claim wouldbe basedon intentionalinflictionof emotional 
ArrestedAfterSending ViolentFiction over Internet,N.Y TIMES,Feb. 11, 1995, at A10. distress. The next question is whether,if a state law claim is available,the awardof damageswould violatethe FirstAmendment.At firstglance it seems that the question shouldbe resolvedin the same way as any case in which a writeruses a real person'sname in fiction of this sort. And it certainlydoes not seem clearthatthe FirstAmendmentshouldprohibitstatesfromawarding damagesfor conductof this kind, so long as no politicalissue is involved.167 Perhapsthe ease of massive distributionof such materials,which can be sent to much of the worldwith the touchof a button,arguesin favorof loosening the constitutionalconstraintson compensatorydamages. 
Whatof a regulatoryregimedesignedto preventinvasionof privacy,libel, unwantedcommercial messages, and obscenity,168harassment,or infliction of emotional distress?Some such regulatoryregime will ultimatelymake a greatdeal of sense. The principalobstaclesare thatthe regulationsshouldbe both clear and narrow.It is easy to imaginea broador vague regulation,one thatwould seize uponthe sexuallyexplicitor violentnatureof communication to justify regulationthatis farbroaderthannecessary.Moreover,it is possible to imaginea situationin whichliabilitywas extendedto anyowneror operator who could have no knowledgeof the particularmaterialsbeing sent.169The underlyingquestion,having to do with efficient risk allocation,involves the extent to which a carriermight be expected to find and to stop unlawful messages; thatquestiondependsuponthe relevanttechnology. 
Considermore particularlypossible efforts to controlthe distributionof sexually explicit materialson the Internet.Insofaras the governmentseeks to ban materials that are technically obscene, and imposes civil or criminal liability on someone with specific intent to distributesuch materials,there should be no constitutionalproblem. By hypothesis, these materials lack constitutionalprotection,andmaterialslackingconstitutionaplrotectioncanbe bannedin cyberspaceas everywhereelse. On the otherhand,manyactualand imaginablebills would extendbeyondthe technicallyobscene,to include(for example) materialsthat are "indecent,"or "lewd,"or "filthy."17T0erms of this sort createa seriousrisk of unconstitutionavlaguenessor overbreadth.171 At least at first glance, they appearunconstitutionaflor thatreason. 
telecommunicationsprovidersof obscene materials. 
Decency Act of 1995, in the U.S. Senate.In an effort to controldigitalpornographyi,t originallywould have made all telecommunicationsprovidersdoing business in the United States (from the telephone companies,all the way down to offices thatuse local areanetworks)liablefor the contentof anythingsent over theirnetworks.As it emergedfromcommittee,S. 314 exemptedcarriersfrom liability.Id.; see also PeterH. Lewis, Despite a New Planfor CoolingIt Off, CybersexStaysHot, N.Y.TIMESM,ar.26, 1995, at 1, 34 (discussingS. 314 and its potentialunconstitutionality) 
Children'sTelevisionv. FCC, 11 F.3d 170 (D.C. Cir. 1993);Action for Children'sTelevisionv. FCC,932 F.2d 1504 (D.C. Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 1281 (1992). 
The bestjustificationfor expansivetermsof this kindwould be to protect children from harmful materials. It is true that the Internet contains pornographyaccessible to children,some of it coming from adultsexplicitly seeking sexual relationswithchildren.Thereis in fact materialon the Internet containing requests to childrenfor their home addresses.'72Solicitationsto engage in unlawfulactivityareunprotectedby the FirstAmendment,whether they occur on the Internetor anywhere else. For this reason, regulation designedto preventthese sortsof requestsshouldnotbe held unconstitutional. 
But when governmentgoes beyond solicitation,and bans "indecent"or "filthy"materialin general,the questionis quitedifferent.Herea centralissue is whetherthe governmenthas chosenthe leastrestrictivemeansof preventing the relevantharmsto children.In a case involving"dial-a-porn,"for example, the Court struck down a ban on "indecent"materialson the ground that childrencould be protectedin other ways.173On the Madisonianview, this outcome is questionable, since "dial-a-porn"ranks low on the First Amendmenthierarchy.But underexisting law, it seems clear thatin orderto supportan extensionbeyondobscenity,Congresswouldhaveto show thatless restrictive alternativeswould be ineffectual.The question then becomes a factual one: What sorts of technologicaloptions exist by which parentsor otherscan providethe relevantprotection?To answerthis question,it would be necessaryto explorethe possibilityof creating"locks"withinthe Internet, for use by parents,or perhapsfor use by those who write certain sorts of materials.174 
Differentquestionswouldbe raisedby the impositionof civil or criminal liability not on the distributorshaving specific intent to distribute,but on carrierswho have no knowledgeof the specific materialsat issue, and could not obtain such knowledge without considerabledifficulty and expense. It might be thought that the carriershould be treatedlike a publisher,and a publishercan of course be held liable for obscene or libelous materialseven if the publisherhas no specific knowledgeof the offending material.But in light of the relativelylow costs of searchin the worldof magazineand book publishing,it is reasonableto thinkthat a publishershould be chargedwith havingcontrolover the contentof its publications.Perhapsthe samecannotbe saidfor the ownerof an electronicmailservice.Herethe properanalogymight instead be the carriageof mail, in which owners of services are not held criminallyor civilly liable for obscene or libelous materials.The underlying theoryis thatit wouldbe unreasonableto expectsuchownersto inspectall the materialsthey transporta,ndtheimpositionof criminalliability,at least,would have an unacceptablyharmfuleffect upon a desirableservice involving the 
Heart of the First Amendmentin the Age of InteractiveMedia, 104 YALEL.J. 1619, 1632-34 (1995). distributionof a greatdeal of protectedspeech.If carrierswere held liable for distributingunprotectedspeech,therewouldinevitablybe an adverseeffect on the disseminationof protectedspeech too. In other words, the problemwith carrierliability,in this context,is thatit would interferewith protectedas well as unprotectedspeech. 
How do these points bear on the FirstAmendmentissue with respectto the Internet?Some of the services thatprovideaccess to the Internetshould not themselvesbe treatedas speakers;they areprovidersof speech, but their own speech is not at issue. This pointis closely relatedto the debatein Turner about the speech status of cable carriers.But whether or not a carrieror provideris a speaker,a harmfuleffect on speechwouldraiseFirstAmendment issues. We can see this point with an analogy. Certainlyit would not be constitutionalto say that truckowners will be criminallyliable for carrying newspaperscontainingarticlescriticalof the President.Sucha measurewould be unconstitutionailn its purposesandin its effects, even if the truckowners are not speakers.Fromthis we can see thata criminalpenaltyon carriersof materialthat is independentlyprotectedby the First Amendmentshould be unconstitutionalT.hus a criminalpenaltycould not be imposedfor providing "filthy"speech, at least if "filthy"speech is otherwiseprotected. 
But a penaltyimposedon otherwiseunprotectedmaterialsraisesa different question. Suppose that the governmentimposes criminalliability on carriers or providersof admittedlyobscenematerialon the Internet.The adverseeffect on unprotectedspeechshouldnotby itself be foundto offendthe Constitution, even if therewouldbe a harmfuleconomiceffect, andeven unfairness,for the providerof the service. Insteadthe constitutionalquestionshouldturnon the extent of the adverse effects on the disseminationof materials that are protectedby the Constitution.If, for example, the imposition of criminal liabilityfor the distributionof unprotectedspeechhad seriousharmfuleffects for the distributionof protectedspeech,the FirstAmendmentissue would be quite severe.

VI. MADISON IN CYBERSPACE? 
Do Madisonianideals have an enduringrole in Americanthoughtabout freedomof speech?The SupremeCourthas not saidfor certain;its signalsare quite mixed; and the existence of new technologies makes the question differentand far more complex than it once was. It is conceivablethat in a worldof newly emergingandcountlessoptions,the marketwill proveliterally unstoppable,as novel possibilities outstripeven well-motivatedgovernment controls. 
If so, this result should not be entirely lamented. It would be an understatementto say that a world in which consumers can choose from limitless choices has manyadvantages,not leastfromthe Madisonianpointof view. If choices are limitless, people interestedin politics can see and listen to politics;perhapsthey can even participatein politics,andin ways thatwere impossiblejust a decadeago. But thatworldwouldbe farfromperfect.It may increase social balkanization.It may not promote deliberation,but foster insteada series of referendain cyberspacethatbetrayconstitutionalgoals. 
My centralpoint here has been thatthe system of free expressionis not anaimlessabstractionF.arfrombeinganoutgrowthof neoclassicaleconomics, the FirstAmendmenthas independentand identifiablepurposes.Free speech doctrine,with its proliferatingtests, distinctions,andsubparts,shouldnot lose touch with those purposes.Rooted in a remarkableconception of political sovereignty,the goals of the FirstAmendmentareclosely connectedwith the foundingcommitmentto a particularkindof polity:a deliberativedemocracy among informedcitizens who are political equals. It follows that insteadof allowingnew technologiesto use democraticprocessesfortheirown purposes, constitutionallaw shouldbe concernedwith harnessingthose technologiesfor democraticends-including the foundingaspirationsto public deliberation, citizenship, political equality,and even a certainkind of virtue. If the new technologies offer risks on these scores, they hold out enormouspromiseas well. I have arguedherethatwhetherthatpromisewill be realizeddependsin significantparton judgmentsof law, includingjudgmentsaboutthe point of the First Amendment. 
When historians write about historical issues associated with the American Constitution, what is their goal? What are they trying to do? At one stage the answer was simple: Offer an accurate description of the facts. If it turns out that the Framers were good democrats attempting to discipline potentially evil representatives by reference to the will of the assembled people, the historian should simply announce that (happy) fact. If, on the other hand, the facts show that the Framers were manipulative, self-interested aristocrats seeking to limit the power of the public, the historian's job is to say so. 
It is now much disputed whether and to what extent this conception of the historian's role can be sustained.1 Of course there is no view from nowhere; of course we all stand somewhere. Perhaps any historical account, offered by someone in a particular time and place, will reflect current preoccupations and potentially controversial assumptions. To say the least, it is hard to avoid forms of selectivity in dealing with the past. This possibility should certainly not be read for more than it is worth.2 No one ought to doubt that nations, including the United States, have had a past; no one should doubt that there are really facts to which any historical account must attempt to conform. But human beings see history through their own filters, including their own assumptions, and the result is, inevitably, something other than unmediated access to what happened before. Whether this is a serious obstacle to the traditional understanding of the historian's task is a large and disputed question. 
The traditional constitutional lawyer 3 tends to view the historian's role in pretty conventional terms, as a search for "the facts."4 Often historians have been sharply critical of constitutional history as done by constitutional lawyers; when they are, they tend to see the constitutional lawyer as an advocate, or as a debased historian, mining the past for insights * Karl N. Llewellyn Professor ofJurisprudence, University of Chicago. I am grateful to Akhil Amar, Elena Kagan, Larry Lessig, David Strauss, G. Edward White, Gordon Wood, and especially Richard Ross for helpful comments on a previous draft.

L.Rev. 523, 552-53 (1995). congenial to the lawyer's political convictions.5 One of my prime purposes here is to respond to historians who think of the historically-inclined constitutional lawyer in these terms. What I want to suggest is that the historian and the constitutional lawyer have legitimately different roles. The constitutional lawyer interested in history need not be a politically motivated scavenger of real historical work, but a different sort of creature altogether, with a special and not dishonorable function. 
In short, the constitutional lawyer thinking about constitutional history has a particular purpose and a recognizable project, and what a constitutional lawyer finds from history may, for legitimate reasons relating to that purpose and that role, be quite different from what a historian finds there. This does not reduce the constitutional lawyer to a mere advocate. But it does mean that the function of the constitutional lawyer, even if historically inclined, is properly and unembarrassingly distinctive. 
Nothing in what I have said, or will say, denies that the constitutional lawyer owes certain duties of fidelity to the past. The constitutional lawyer should not claim that the history supports a particular view when it does not. The history can falsify much of what the constitutional lawyer might seek to say, at least if the constitutional lawyer genuinely cares about history. History imposes constraints on the lawyer as well as the historian. 
If they are reflective, however, many constitutional lawyers will happily acknowledge that they see their task not as uncovering the "facts," and not as simply describing what happened, but instead as interpretive in something like Ronald Dworkin's sense of that term. 6 On this view, constitutional lawyers, unlike ordinary historians, should attempt to make the best constructivesense out of historicalevents associatedwith the Constitution. They do owe a duty of "fit" to the materials;7 they cannot disregard the actual events, which therefore discipline their accounts. But they also try to conceive of the materials in a way that makes political or moral sense, rather than nonsense, out of them to current generations. 
Everyone can see that the political or moral commitments of the consitutional lawyer are an omnipresent part of the constitutional lawyer's constitutional history.8 Why is this? Is it an embarrassment, or does 
HeinOnline -- 95 Colum. L. Rev. 602 1995 1995] it reveal something disturbing or untoward? I do not think so. Political or moral commitments play a role because of the interpretive nature of the lawyer's enterprise, which involves showing how the history might be put to present use. I think that this interpretive enterprise is typified, for example, in Bruce Ackerman's work, though Ackerman often writes as if he were simply describing the facts.9 I also think that this interpretive enterprise is far from mere advocacy. The distinction requires more elaborate treatment than I can offer here. For the moment, let me simply suggest that the true advocate begins with a preestablished conclusion, is interested only in persuasion, and allows his political convictions to dominate everything that he says, whereas the historically-inclined constitutional lawyer is interested in truth, and owes duties of objectivity and fairness to the materials that he invokes.' 0 
With this in mind we come to the idea of a useablepast. 1 This idea points to the goal of finding elements in history that can be brought fruitfully to bear on current problems. The search for a useable past is a defining feature of the constitutional lawyer's approach to constitutional history. It may or may not be a part of the historian's approach to constitutional history, depending on the particular historian's conception of the historian's role. The historian may not be concerned with a useable past at all, at least not in any simple sense. Perhaps the historian wants to reveal the closest thing to a full picture of the past, or to stress the worst aspects of a culture's legal tradition; certainly there is nothing wrong with these projects. But constitutional history as set out by the constitutional lawyer, as a participant in the constitutional culture, usually tries to put things in a favorable or appealing light without, however, distorting what actually can be found. 
Is the constitutional lawyer's approach-as I am describing it herecynical, or dishonest, or debased, or reflective of a form of "history lite"? The question cannot be answered in the abstract. Sometimes the charge of cynicism, dishonesty, debasement, or "liteness" is entirely warranted. For example, it is familiar to find a constitutional lawyer reading history at a very high level of abstraction ("the Framers were committed to freedom of speech") and concluding that some concrete outcome follows for us ("laws regulating obscenity are unconstitutional"). This use of history is not honorable. It is a bad version of formalism-the pretense that concrete cases can be resolved by reference to general propositions, when in fact some supplemental value judgments are required. 12 
form of selectivity, see Putnam, supra note 2, at 180-200. 
the Rules 229-33 (1991); this species of formalism calls for adherence to the literal text of legal materials. 
Moreover, constitutional lawyers, preoccupied with the idea of a useable past, may draw from history a lesson that comes pretty much entirely from their own political commitments, and not at all from the history itself. Certainly this is true of some of Robert Bork's use of history.'5 Bork's particular understanding of the so-called Madisonian dilemma would not be appealing to Madison; consider Bork's suggestion, which Madison would not find even plausible, that "majorities are entitled to rule, if they wish, simply because they are majorities." 14 Some of John Hart Ely's use of history-to support a "process-perfecting" conception of judicial review-probably belongs in this category as well. 15 
On the other hand, constitutional lawyers should not argue that the Constitution requires whatever they think a good constitution would say, and as a way of disciplining legal judgment, constitutional lawyers should look to history as a part of constitutional interpretation. Hence there is nothing at all dishonorable in the idea that constitutional lawyers should try to identify those features of the constitutional past that are, in their view, especially suitable for present constitutional use. The American constitutional culture gives special weight to the convictions of those who ratified constitutional provisions, and though I cannot fully defend the claim here, I believe that this interpretive practice is legitimate. Constitutional law is based on ideas about authority, not just on ideas about the good or the right. Constitutional history16 provides a way of constraining legal judgments, invoking a set of provisions with at least some kind of democratic pedigree, and providing a shared set of materials from which judicial reasoning can proceed.17 
Nothing in these remarks is inconsistent with the proposition that much in our constitutional history is bad and no longer useable. Some aspects of constitutional history that are of considerable importance to Ind. LJ. 1 (1971); see also Robert H. Bork, The Tempting ofAmerica (1990) [hereinafter Bork, The Tempting ofAmerica]. 

sources, and of understanding the best and most recent work by historians. See Flaherty, supra note 4, at 553-56. 
(unpublished manuscript, on file with Columbia Law Review). Of course there remains the question of deciding at what level of generality the history is to be read. If read at a high level, the history could authorize any decision at all; if read at a very low level, the result would probably be useless for current problems. It follows that some kind of intermediate course will make best sense, though I can hardly discuss this complex issuethe issue of "how to read" the past for constitutional purposes-in this space. Doubts about the possibility of the historical enterprise-how can we know what long-dead people really meant? how can we possibly reconstruct their world?-seem to me overstated in principle; but whether or not they are overstated, such doubts are hard for the constitutional lawyer to entertain. For better or for worse, the lawyer participates in a culture in which historical arguments are important, and it is therefore unhelpful to throw up one's hands. constitutional historians may not be so useful for constitutional lawyers. Slavery was of course accepted in the Founding period; the Framers' conception of free speech was almost certainly much narrower than anyone would find reasonable today; the Framers' conception of equality would permit forms of discrimination that the Supreme Court would unanimously condemn. It is undoubtedly worthwhile for people to explore old and sometimes unacceptable understandings for purposes of grasping our own constitutional past. 
What I am suggesting is that the constitutional lawyer, thinking about the future course of constitutional law, has a special project in mind, and that there is nothing wrong with that project.' 8 The historian is trying to reimagine the past, necessarily from a present-day standpoint, but subject to the discipline provided by the sources and by the interpretive conventions in the relevant communities of historians. By contrast; the constitutional lavyer is trying to contribute to the legal culture's repertoire of arguments and political/legal narratives that place a (stylized) past and present into a trajectory leading to a desired future. On this view, the historically-minded lawyer need not be thought to be doing a second-rate or debased version of what the professional historians do well, but is working in a quite different tradition with overlapping but distinct criteria. 
My own interest in constitutional history'9 has largely stemmed from an effort to re-evaluate two understandings common in the last generation: that the Framers were principally or exclusively concerned with the protection of preexisting private rights (the so-called Lockean account20 ), or that they sought instead to set out the terms for interestgroup struggle (the so-called pluralist account 2 1 ). These understandings are quite inadequate.2 2 The Framers were republicans, and they were republicans in the distinctive sense that they prized civic virtue and sought to promote deliberation in government-deliberation oriented toward right answers about the collective good. We cannot understand our constitutional heritage without resort to these points. 
Republicanism, .thus understood, does not stand opposed to liberalism, and indeed the opposition between republicanism and liberalism 
HeinOnline -- 95 Colum. L. Rev. 605 1995 has been quite damaging to the academic study of law (and to the profession of history as well).23 But republicanism is sharply opposed to interest-group pictures of governance. It favors instead a conception of deliberative democracy. For constitutional lawyers as well as historians, this is a matter of considerable importance. It bears on how we think about the Founding document and it also relates to, though it certainly does not resolve, a range of concrete constitutional controversies. 
Of course the republican tradition, in some of its incarnations, has been associated with unappealing and unusable ideals-exclusion of women, militarism, lack of respect for competing conceptions of the good, and more. But the commitment to deliberative democracy is not logically connected with those unappealing ideals; indeed, as an abstraction it is in considerable tension with them. Constitutional lawyers who are interested in republicanism need not be embarrassed by its contingent historical connection with unjust practices. Nearly all traditions, and nearly all expositors of traditions, can be shown to have had blind spots, and this does not mean that it is wrong to attend to traditions and to their best expositors. 
To be sure, there is a freestanding, nonhistorical argument for deliberative democracy as a central political ideal.2 4 But for constitutional lawyers, the argument for deliberative democracy should be interpretive (in the sense I have described) rather than freestanding. That argument draws substantial support from historical understandings. All this leaves open a wide range of questions, to say the least; but I think that it helps to explain the interest in republicanism as an historical phenomenon from the standpoint not just of historians, but also of constitutional lawyers in particular. I think that it also helps explain why the constitu23. Liberalism and republicanism are opposed, for example, in White, supra note 5, and Rodgers, supra note 5. Rodgers in particular identifies liberalism with an "inability to imagine politics as anything other than interest group pluralism," and as committed to "procedural neutrality." These understandings of liberalism, found in much historical work, are extremely odd, and based at most on certain strands in liberalism. Those strands should hardly be identified with the liberal tradition itself. Mill, Rawls, and Raz, for example, thoroughly reject these ideas, and reject them because of their understanding of what liberalism entails. See John Smart Mill, Considerations on Representative Government (Gateway Editions 1962) (1861); John Rawls, A Theory of Justice (1971); Joseph Raz, The Morality of Freedom (1986). 
To say this is not to deny that some republicans emphasized some goals that some liberals tend to view skeptically. Some liberals, for example, emphasize the likely role of self-interest in politics, whereas some republicans stress pre-modern ideas involving corruption in government and the concept of "virtue." See White, supra note 5, at 7. But these differences of emphasis should not be taken to suggest that the liberal and republican traditions are at war or even distinguishable. Better antonyms to republicanism are interest-group pluralism and conceptions of politics that see protection of private rights as the sole purpose of constitutional structure. 
Polity 17, 18-26 (Alan Hamlin & Philip Pettit eds., 1990); Jfirgen Habermas, Three Normative Models of Democracy, 1 Constellations 10 (1994). tional lawyer's conception of republicanism need not entirely track that of the historian. 
In his instructive article, Flaherty does not contest the view that the Framers were republicans in a distinctive sense, nor does he challenge the claim that the Framers sought to promote deliberation in government. Insofar as he discusses my views, Flaherty's principal argument is that I have stressed the Framers' emphasis on political deliberation at the expense of their concern about rights and, in particular, about natural rights. This is an important and complex issue, and it is good to see the issue raised at the level of both historical understanding and constitutional theory.25 By way of response, I offer a few brief remarks here, intended not to resolve this complex issue, but to point to some directions for future inquiry. 
Of course the Framers were committed to rights, and of course they sometimes spoke in terms of natural rights. No eighteenth-century American or British republican opposed rights, or saw the slightest tension between his commitment to republicanism and his commitment to rights. But-my first point-many of the rights that the Framers prized were in fact a precondition for political liberty and thoroughly understood as such.26 The right to freedom of speech is the best example, but it is complemented by the right to ajury trial, the right to bear arms, the right to private property, and much more. To this extent, an emphasis on rights, and even natural rights, is not inconsistent with the emphasis on deliberative democracy as a conception of republicanism. On the contrary, a properly-functioning deliberative democracy prizes rights. The Framers well understood this point. 
As Flaherty shows, the Framers did not believe that all rights, to qualify as such, must be associated with political deliberation; and the category of natural rights, extending beyond politics, was one with which the Framers were familiar. But-and this is my second point-we should be extremely careful with the idea of "natural rights" as it was understood in the eighteenth century. It would be interesting to ask random constitutional lawyers a trivia question: How many times does the phrase "natural rights" appear in The FederalistPapers? The term occurs not a hundred times, not twenty times, not ten times, but only once-and then in an inconsequential place. 27 The notion of natural rights was much less of a defining theme than many observers think. 
Moreover, the phrase "natural rights," when used, had certain complex meanings, and it is important for modern observers to be careful in reconstructing those meanings. Even those who believed in natural rights need not have thought that there was a correspondence between such rights and the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Recall that Hume conceived of property rights as part of convention rather than nature.28 Jefferson thought in the same terms. 2 9 When the Founding generation spoke of "natural rights," it is not simple for twentieth-century observers to understand what they meant. Often the term "nature" has been identified with the best conception of human flourishing, rather than with what would happen without governmental interference. This is the classical understanding,3 0 and it had a strong influence on the Framers. Perhaps the Framers, when speaking of natural rights, were responding to those who spoke of the "divine right" of kings, and perhaps they were deploying the rhetoric of "nature" for the distinct purpose of meeting that way of seeing things.3 ' 
Notwithstanding these points, Flaherty is undoubtedly correct to point to the area of eighteenth-century "rights" as one that modem constitutional commentators have inadequately understood, certainly in law. There is a great deal more to do on this important subject. Perhaps Flaherty's essay can help constitutional lawyers to embark on this long overdue task. When they do so, it will probably be as part of their interpretive enterprise, and what I am emphasizing here is that this enterprise has special characteristics that distinguish it from the enterprise of the ordinary historian. 
USING COMMON LAW PRINCIPLES IN REGULATORY SCHEMES (WITH A NOTE ON VICTIMOLOGY) 
CASS R. SUNSTEIN" 
In this Article, I will discuss two different things. First, I will explore strategies that might synthesize some of the virtues of the common law with the potential virtues of modem regulation to produce outcomes that would save both lives and money. Second, I will address problems of the rhetoric of victimization in this setting and maybe in other settings, too. 
If economic analysis of law has shown anything, it has shown that the common law was a regulatory system, and that as a regulatory system the common law had many virtues.' It was, and is, highly decentralized; it is extremely flexible; and it is market oriented. Nonetheless, as a complete solution in an industrialized society, the common law is an inadequate remedy, and this for three different reasons. 
First, there is a widespread lack of information. Courts do not have the information that would enable them to make sensible decisions about the destruction of the ozone layer, about air pollution of the sort that one encounters in cities, or about occupational safety and health. Judges often lack the information, and litigants lack the information too. 
The second problem involves not information, but externalities or transaction costs. Contracts are an inadequate solution in cases in which harms are felt by people who are not parties. The * Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Jurisprudence, The University of Chicago Law School and Department of Political Science. 
tort system is an inadequate solution in situations in which the people who are not parties, but who are affected, are numerous, hurt just a little bit, and poorly organized. No modem nation runs a system of air pollution on the common law model, and that is good. A common law model would make no sense for air pollution. 
Not only is there a problem of externalities and lack of information, there also is a democratic problem. The common law, for all its virtues, is not a democratic system. It is not a system in which representatives and the people make decisions about the basic terms of social life. In the system that aspires to be democratic, there has to be much room for politically accountable bodies making regulatory choices. 
For these reasons, the common law has to be supplemented and, in some cases, supplanted by modem regulation. Now, I will address the problems in our system-the system we have chosen in the last twenty-five years. But let there be no mistaking the fact that the air is much cleaner and the water less dirty than it would have been had we continued to rely on the common law.' 
This is an unremarked success story-the fact that the Environmental Protection Agency, although usually at excessive cost, has often reduced risk with respect to air and water. There is a political science story behind the fact that the success story is unremarked. It has to do with an odd coalition supporting silence on the part of critics of regulation and enthusiasts for regulation, neither of whom has a terribly great stake in describing success stories. Nonetheless, well over 100 million Americans once lived in areas that were dirty in terms of national health standards with respect to air. Now the number is much, much smaller and it continues to decrease. With respect to all of the conventional air pollutants, both ambient air quality levels and emission levels have gone way, way down-a terrific success story.' 
Nonetheless, there are two big problems in the system of regulation, both of them stemming from the fact that we have cho3. See i& at 77-80. 
AGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL OPTIMISM (1995). 
Common Law Principlesin Regulatoy Schemes sen a system of Soviet style centralized command and control.' The first problem is one of poor priority setting. There is no systemic mechanism to ensure that we are going after real problems and not tiny problems. In fact, there tends to be a pollutant-of-the-month syndrome by which USA Today spurs regulatory initiatives, to which Congress and agencies react without getting a systematic sense of where that particular pollutant fits in our system.6 Command and control produces not only poor priority setting, but also a second problem-what Justice Breyer has described as mismatch:7 a poor fit between the problem that calls for regulation and the solution that government chooses. 
Recall here two problems in the common law: lack of information and externalities (or transaction costs). If people lack information, the first thing to do is to provide them with exactly that. Too infrequently, however, does the national government acquire information and let markets and local government do their work once the information is furnished. Would it not be wonderful if workers equipped with information about the risks they face, or consumers equipped with information about the risks of goods, found out the relevant facts and then made their own decisions? Too frequently, government has displaced markets by commanding a particular outcome instead of reinforcing markets by letting people know the actual facts. And when externalities do exist, the appropriate response is usually not a rigid mandate from the Environmental Protection Agency, but some sort of economic incentive instrument-one that will ensure that the government is allowing companies that inflict harm on others to reflect in their prices the costs of the harms they are producing. Rigid federal mandates do not do that-they do not let markets do what markets are good at doing. A federal mandate system will produce all sorts of pathologies: regulations that accomplish very little good, some regulations that produce harm, and poor priority setting.' 
I will now discuss some nonsolutions and then some solutions. 
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES (1995). 

1996); Cass R. Sunstein, Congress, Constitutional Moments, and the Cost-Benefit State, 48 STAN. L. REV. 247 (1996) [hereinafter ConstitutionalMoments]. Three things, which I think are not terribly sound as solutions, are quite popular with the current Congress. These things in decreasing order of senselessness are moratoria," procedural barriers, and cost-benefit requirements." Moratoria on regulation are just too crude. They prevent things that might make a great deal of sense. "Super mandates" in the form of exhaustive paperwork requirements are a way of stultifying agencies in cases in which they might be doing good things. They are a way of ensuring the perpetuation of the status quo. 
Cost-benefit analysis is a lot better than absolutism of the sort that some statutes require, and to engraft it on the current regulatory structure might well make things better. But imagine if the Soviet Union, in its dying gasps, had decided that it would have a new kind of five-year plan: a five-year plan based not on absolutes, but on cost-benefit analysis. Would that be a whole lot better than the Soviet style five-year plans that did not do costbenefit balancing? If the EPA is told to do cost-benefit balancing, it will probably do better than it sometimes does. But it would be much better to have a more creative and imaginative solution, one that enlists the incentives and the information of the private sector rather than the lack of information and sometimes poor incentives of the public sector. 
What would make better sense? Well, the government ought to be doing much more experimentation with informational strategies for controlling risk. In this way, it ought to improve and then rely on markets, private forces, and local governments by letting people know relevant facts-something the Center for Disease Control frequently does do. People ought to know what the risks are and act in their private capacity or in their local capacity. We ought to have much less in the way of mandates, much more in the way of disclosure strategies. This is an experimental approach that is in its incipient stages. 
Instead of cost-benefit analysis, it would also be a really good idea to make those who inflict harm pay through economic incentives. We could even, as the Federal Water Pollution Act draft Agencies'Activism, WASH. POST, Feb. 18, 1996, at Al (reporting that the Regulatory Transition Act would impose a one-year moratorium on federal regulations). 
Feb. 28, 1996, at A19 (reporting that many Congressional reformers support cost-benefit requirements). 
Common Law Principlesin Regulatory Schemes that the Republicans have proposed does, allow private contracting in the sense of private initiatives that develop alternative means of satisfying regulatory goals-that do so as well but much cheaper." This proposal represents a potentially wonderful step that should maintain the current environmental benefits at a lower cost than the current programs.'" The Democrats ought not be opposing it. What I am suggesting is an effort to integrate the virtues of the common law-its flexible, decentralized, and market-oriented character-in a way that responds to the vices of the common law: the lack of information, the fact that externalities are inflicted, and the fact that decisions are made by unelected judges rather than by people who actually are accountable to the public. These changes would include informational strategies and economic incentives. 
Now, I will comment on the general rhetoric of victimization, which you will notice I have not used. My puzzle is that the common law, as a regulatory system, recognized a lot of rights and gave people causes of action. But that was part of people's agency; in fact, it was a big part of their agency. It is not thought that when people at common law have rights and wield them, they are thereby converted into victims. 
I am about 400 pages into Mr. D'Souza's book.'3 He is a real fan of Martin Luther King, Jr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Justice Thurgood Marshall, my~old boss, sought legal remedies for harms, sometimes self-consciously building on the common law. For those who deplore the call to victimization, Martin Luther King, Jr. certainly is not a villain of the piece. King and Justice Marshall do not appear as pitiful victims. And the Contract with America is not charged with turning people into victims or with partaking of the culture of victimology. It urges legal rights in the form of property rights and legal protection for people who are subject to overzealous regulation.'4 
This is the puzzle: when does the fact that the legal system NVS SERV., May 10, 1995 (reporting that the Federal Water Pollution Act will shift power over water pollution regulation to localities). 

SOCIETY (1995). 
THE PLAIN DEALER, Oct. 1995, at 18A (reporting that the House approved a property rights protection bill). recognizes a right stigmatize someone as a victim? My hypothesis is that it does so when the relevant right seems not to deserve to qualify as such. That is the question we ought to be addressing; it is a substantive question. My concern is that the use of the term "victimology" bypasses the substantive question of which rights ought to be recognized. It does so through a kind of rhetorical flourish that is, I fear, starting to become a substitute for thought. I am proud to say that the Federalist Society was founded in part at the University of Chicago, and one of its best characteristics has been an attack on liberal shibboleths by looking at real consequences and specific problems and by asking what law actually does, not by throwing around rhetoric as liberal thought often did in the 1960s and '70s. My concern is that it would be unfortunate if the term victimology became a new question-begging shibboleth-one that was not an invitation to concrete thought about real problems, but that operated to truncate thought in the form of an accusation. 
In sum, I have not used the word victimology; I do not think it is a very helpful concept in this context. It might not be very helpful elsewhere. With respect to substance, it would be very good if we did not ask, as The New York Times is asking today, whether we are going to "roll back" environmental regulation or not.' It would be good if we did not debate, as Congress is now debating, whether we are going to have "more" or "less" regulation. Such questions can be answered, but in a way that is too crude to help. It would be much better if we could synthesize the virtues of private law-its market-oriented, efficient mechanisms-with the virtues of regulation, and if we could do that by relying far more than we have previously on informational approaches, market fortifications, and economic incentives that improve but do not bypass markets. 
In this David C. Baum Memorial Lecture on Civil Liberties and Civil Rights, Professor Sunstein begins by noting that participants in the civil rights movement were often backward looking and even conservative, invoking commitments from the nation's past and arguingagainst reliance on the judiciaryand the Supreme Court. They stressed above all two time-honored liberal principles:freedom from desperate conditions and opposition to caste. It is wrong to say (as many now do) that the movement was founded on a principle of race neutrality, and also wrong to say (as some now do) that the movement was opposed to "categories"or "binary oppositions." ProfessorSunstein then raises important issues of character by exploring the works of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X. He concludes by discussing the risks of dehumanization and brutality in movements committed to significant social change.

AUTOBIOGRAPHY]. 
On a theoretical level, you can say that we believed in wanting to make history and achieve civil rights. But there was something else. . . . The whole emotion of defining not only yourself, but also your life by risking your life, and testing whether you're willing to die for your beliefs, was the powerful motive, I believe. -Tom Hayden, 1987' I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, that one day, right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. -Martin Luther King, Jr.4 What claims were made by those involved in the civil rights movement of the 1960s? What sorts of changes were sought for society and particularly for law? And what are the implications of the civil rights movement for the issues that face us today? In this essay, I will explore a few aspects of this very large and controversial topic. 
This is a somewhat unusual subject for a lawyer; but the topic is far from irrelevant to law. Some people think that the American constitutional tradition has been punctuated by a range of constitutional moments. 5 Whether or not this is so, the civil rights movement of the 1960s unquestionably helped transform our understandings of constitutional principles, including most prominently rights to free speech and equal protection of the laws. The political and moral claims of the movement helped spur legislation' that continues to raise foundational issues about our constitutional order.7 
Few people think that the civil rights movement actually amended the constitution,8 and very possibly the best view is that social movements of this kind have no bearing on constitutional meaning. But if we are simply describing our practices, it seems clear that disputes about the appropriate characterization-and evaluation-of the movement play a continuing role in public debate and even constitutional law. It is therefore plausible to say that a discussion of the civil rights movement is not only of interest in its own right. It also connects to our understanding of our constitutional heritage. 
There are of course great hazards in describing so large and diverse a movement, with so many different defining strands, in a short compass. What I will say is shamelessly selective and impressionistic. As my principal texts, I use the writings of Martin Luther King, Jr., the writings of Malcolm X, and the founding document of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), the Port Huron Statement.9 My goal is mostly descriptive, though not surprisingly my own evaluations will appear from time to time. 
Perhaps surprisingly, a careful reading of the basic documents of the civil rights movement shows that much of the movement was conservative and backward looking. At least in its earliest stages, and to a significant extent thereafter, its defining aspirations came from America's own stated ideals. Often participants in the movement attempted to identify those ideals and to insist that the nation should live up to them. In this way the movement had an important Burkean caste, looking to the past to help define the appropriate content of the future. 
For the most part, participants in the movement made little effort to find basic commitments in places external to the American culture, or to challenge the American culture itself. They described racial inequality as an anomalous institution entirely inconsistent with the basic thrust of American ideals and practices. (This came to be one of the most visible divisions between Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X, with the latter repudiating American ideals as fundamentally infected with racism. 10) In this way, the civil rights movement borrowed a conventional lawyer's strategy: to invoke a widely shared and timehonored ideal and to show that the practice at issue did not comport with that ideal. 
For example, the Port Huron Statement insisted that "[t]he declaration 'all men are created equal . . .' rang hollow before the facts of Negro life in the South and the big cities of the North."" The student authors emphasized "the hypocrisy of American ideals."' 2 Martin Luther King, Jr., challenged the same thing in similar words, saying "All we say to America is-Be true to what you said on paper."' 3 
King's speeches frequently looked backward for the nation's core commitments. Thus he wrote in the "I have a dream" speech that his "is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed-we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal." 1'4 Thus he suggested that "[o]ne day the South will know that when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream."15 Thus King self-consciously invoked the Declaration of Independence, emphasizing that "[n]ever has a sociopolitical document proclaimed more profoundly and eloquently the sacredness of human personality." 16 
I have given simply a few illustrations of a pervasive claim in the civil rights movement. As I have suggested, the basic objection-that racial inequality was inconsistent with American ideals-was a defining feature of the movement. As the movement became more radical, some of its members urged that racial inequality was an ineradicable part of American practice, rather than an isolated anomaly. Black nationalism was a response to this claim. 7 
B. 
Participants in the civil rights movement stressed two substantive strands of liberal thought. Both of these are important aspects of liberalism. The first involves freedom from desperate conditions;the second involves opposition to caste. 
American political thought has never been egalitarian. It has rejected equality of income and wealth as both unnecessary and counterproductive."8 But the belief in freedom from desperate conditions-not an egalitarian ideal-has long roots in the American political tradition. This form of freedom was supported by both James Madison 9 and Thomas Jefferson.20 It received one of its most celebrated endorsements in the. 1944 State of the Union address by President Franklin Roosevelt. Roosevelt urged a "second Bill of Rights," including "the right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation," "the right of every family to a decent home," "the right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to 
eds., 1983). 
1953). achieve and enjoy good health," and "the right to a good education."21 
In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the commitment to freedom from desperate conditions was a creation of the civil rights movement or of the 1960s. But ideas of this sort did reemerge, and in dramatic fashion. Such ideas were spurred by Michael Harrington's extremely influential book, The Other America.2 Answering John Kenneth Galbraith's The Affluent Society,23 Harrington contended that in fact many Americans lived in desperate conditions. Though this "other America" was often invisible, it included, according to Harrington, millions of poor people. The book helped contribute to the ''war on poverty" inaugurated by President Johnson. 
An emphasis on desperate conditions was a crucial part of the civil rights movement, and it helped define its basic goals. Thus the Port Huron Statement suggested, "A program against poverty must be just as sweeping as the nature of the problem itself. It must not be just palliative, but directed to the abolition of the structural circumstances of poverty. . . . [E]xisting institutions should be expanded so the welfare state cares for everyone's welfare according to need."" King wrote in the same vein that "[t]he time has come for us to civilize ourselves by the total, direct and immediate abolition of poverty."2' 5 A particular concern was joblessness, and hence King said, "Let us do one simple, direct thing-let us end unemployment totally and immediately."2 
More concretely, King proposed a bill of rights for the disadvantaged, including equal opportunity and a right to training. His statement of overall objectives included "[e]conomic security, decent sanitary housing, and quality education for every American. ' 7 King urged that "[a] Bill of Rights for the Disadvantaged could mark the rise of a new era, in which the full resources of the society would be tuhseedmtiodsatttoafckplethnety.t"e2'n8acious poverty which so paradoxically exists in 
Most dramatically, King proposed toward the end of his life a "poor people's march," designed to dramatize the plight of the disadvantaged. He wrote, 
reprinted in 13 PUBLIC PAPERS AND ADDRESSES OF FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT 32, 41 (Samuel I. Rosenman ed., 1950). 
There are millions of poor people in this country who have very little, or even nothing, to lose. If they can be helped to take action together, they will do so with a freedom and a power that will be a new and unsettling force in our complacent national life. Beginning in the new year, we will be recruiting three thousand of the poorest citizens from ten different urban and rural areas to initiate and lead a sustained, massive, direct-action movement in Washington. . . . [W]e will move on to Washington, determined to stay there until the legislative and executive branches of the government take serious and adequate action on jobs and incomes. . . . The many people who will come and join this three thousand, from all groups in the country's life, will play a supportive role, deciding to be poor for a time along with the dispossessed who are asking for their right to jobs or income-jobs, income, the demolition of slums, and the rebuilding by the people who live there of new communities in their place; in fact, a new economic deal for the poor. 9 This endorsement of "a new economic deal" was the practical effort that followed the commitment to freedom from desperate conditions. 
C. 
An important feature of the civil rights movement might be described as an anticaste principle.30 This principle finds its origins in the original constitutional rejection of the monarchical legacy3' and the explicit constitutional ban on titles of nobility.32 The principle was fueled by the Civil War Amendments and the New Deal. The objection to caste entails an effort to eliminate, in places large and small, the caste system rooted in race. We might say that we have a caste system when a highly visible but morally irrelevant characteristic is associated with second-class citizenship, in the form of systematic disparities in well-being along the most important dimensions of social welfare. Consider in this regard the Port Huron Statement, which begins its discussion of discrimination with the claim, "Our America is still white." 33 The authors supported this claim with reference to sharp disparities between blacks and whites with respect to literacy, salary, work, unemployment, housing, education, and voting.34 
(1993); Cass R. Sunstein, The Anticaste Principle,92 MICH. L. REV. 2410 (1994) [hereinafter Sunstein, The Anticaste Principle]. 
(1992). 


Second-class citizenship was a continuing theme in the writing and speeches of Malcolm X. Indeed, Malcolm X stressed this idea in urging self-help remedies, which he thought necessary to overcome dependent status: 
The American black man should be focussing his every effort toward building his own businesses, and decent homes for himself. As other ethnic groups have done, let the black people, wherever possible, however possible, patronize their own kind, hire their own kind, and start in those ways to build up the black race's ability to do for itself. That's the only way the American black man is ever going to get respect. One thing the white man never can give the black man is self-respect!"6 
In fact, an important feature of any caste system involves corrosive effects on the self-respect of its victims; and self-respect was a key issue in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The interest in racial integration-central, of course, to King-had a great deal to do with such effects. For King, racial segregation was unacceptable because it was a daily reminder of a perceived inferiority. "Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation laws are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority."3 " Part of the problem with segregation was that it denied self-respect: "Segregation scars the soul of both the segregator and the segregated. The segregator looks upon the segregated as a thing to be used, not a person to be respected. ' 37 
Ironically, interest in black nationalism stemmed from similar concerns, with a perception that improved caste status could not be achieved in America.38 Malcolm X favored racial separation on these grounds: [A]s long as our people here in America are dependent upon the white man, we will always be begging him for jobs, food, clothing, and housing. . . . The Negro here in America has been treated like a child. A child stays with the mother until the time of birth! When the time of birth arrives, the child must be separated, or it will destroy its mother and itself .... The child cries for and needs its own world!39 Much of Malcolm X's attack on the movement for integration consisted of a claim that blacks did not need to be with whites in order to succeed. Malcolm X thus wrote: Respect as human beings! That's what America's black masses want. That's the true problem. The black masses want not to be shrunk from as though they are plague-ridden. They want not to be walled up in slums, in the ghettoes, like animals. They want to live in an open, free society where they can walk with their heads up, like men and women!40 
On this count at least, King spoke similarly: "The Negro must boldly throw off the manacles of self-abnegation and say to himself and the world: 'I am somebody. I am a person. I am a man with dignity and honor. I have a rich and noble history, however painful and exploited that history has been.'"41 
The 1960s were a time of extraordinary judge-led developments, with the Warren Court at its ascendancy. But it should be recalled that the civil rights movement was hardly focussed on courts, and in fact the notion of "participatory democracy" enjoyed a large-scale revival in the 1960s.' 2 The revival has had continuing effects on American law. The Port Huron Statement is characterized above all by this theme: "[W]e seek the establishment of a democracy of individual participation, governed by two central aims: that the individual share in those social decisions determining the quality and direction of his life; that society be organized to encourage independence in men and provide the media for common participation. ' 13 Thus the student authors lamented that "almost no students value activity as citizens."" They urged that "politics has the function of bringing people out of isolation and into community."' 5 They sought a political life based on the principle "that decision-making of basic social consequence be carried on by public groupings" and "that politics be seen positively, as the art of collectively creating an acceptable pattern of social relations."' 6 
Ideas of this sort played a substantial role in the civil rights movement. In its early stages the movement had been highly courtcentered, above all in Thurgood Marshall's attack on segregation under the name of the Constitution.' 7 But the Port Huron Statement 
SUPREME COURT. 1936-61 (1994). urged a different direction, saying that "the historic Supreme Court decision of 1954, theoretically desegregating Southern schools, was more a proclamation than a harbinger of social change-and is reflected as such in the fraction of Southern school districts which have desegregated, with Federal officials doing little to spur the process."48 Hence the student movement relied little on courts. 
Rejecting the judge-focussed approach, Martin Luther King sharply criticized reliance on courts alone, suggesting that judicial forums bred passivity: "When legal contests were the sole form of activity, the ordinary Negro was involved as a passive spectator. His interests were stirred, but his energies were unemployed. 49 In a similar vein, King wrote on the inadequacy of decrees standing by themselves: "The law tends to declare rights-it does not deliver them. A catalyst is needed to breathe life experience into a judicial decision by the persistent exercise of the rights until they become usual and ordinary in human conduct." 50 
King also placed a premium on citizenship. To be sure, he was not a participatory democrat of the SDS variety; he saw participation as instrumental to other social goals. But he nonetheless urged widespread involvement in politics: 
I do have a graduation thought to pass along to you. Whatever career you may choose for yourself-doctor, lawyer, teacher-let me propose an avocation to be pursued along with it. Become a dedicated fighter for civil rights. Make it a central part of your nation of your counmtrayk,eanadgareafitneerr pwerosroldn toof lyivoeurisne.l5f1, a greater life. . . .You will Hence King emphasized the political process above all: "The chief weapon in our fight for civil rights is the vote. I can foresee the Negro vote becoming the decisive vote in national elections. 52 One of King's most powerful early speeches is titled: "Give Us the Ballot-We Will Transform the South." The speech is focussed on the need to supplement the judicial branch with democratic forums: 
So far, only the judicial branch of the government has evinced this quality of leadership. If the executive and legislative branches of the government were as concerned about the protection of our citizenship rights as the federal courts have been, then the transition from a segregated to an integrated society would be infinitely smoother.54 
On this count, King and Malcolm X were closely allied. Malcolm X similarly expressed support for nonjudicial arenas: 
The polls are one place where every black man could fight the black man's cause with dignity, and with the power and the tools that the white man understands and respects, and fears, and cooperates with ... 
The cornerstones of this country's operation are economic and political strength and power. The black man doesn't have the economic strength-and it will take time for him to build it. But right now the American black man has the political strength and power to change his destiny overnight. 55 Similarly, Malcolm X said, "I might point out that I am 100 percent for any effort put forth by Black people in this country to have access to the ballot." He urged-in the now famous phrase-that people use "whatever means is necessary to secure those rights."' 6 
II. 
WHAT THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS NOT 
In this section I deal briefly with two relatively recent "readings" of the civil rights movement. The first characterizes the movement as opposed to all racial classifications. On this view, a target of the civil rights movement, if its principles are rightly characterized, is affirmative action, and Martin Luther King is enlisted as an opponent of race-conscious approaches. The second "reading," popular in the academy in general if not in law schools, suggests that the movement should be taken as a challenge to "categorical thinking" or "binary oppositions." I suggest why both readings seem to me unfortunate. 
A. 
"my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character." 7 These words have been invoked in prominent attacks on affirmative action policies.5B But participants in the civil rights movement were emphatically not committed to a norm of colorblindness. Though King sometimes spoke in these terms, he was speaking not abstractly but in a particular context at a particular historical moment, and he meant to make a particular historical point, one very 5 
Brown, 93 YALE L.J. 995, 1000-05 (1984). much connected to issues of lower caste status. He was certainly not speaking to the issue of affirmative action. In fact King was urging a form of social transformation of which affirmative action is, at least plausibly, a part."9 The norm that he urged was not incompatible with affirmative action schemes and indeed could well have been used to support them. 
In fact, King never spoke directly to the issue of affirmative action, although some of his statements suggested that he would hardly have rejected it on principle. Thus King wrote: 
It is impossible to create a formula for the future which does not take into account that our society has been doing something special against the Negro for hundreds of years. How then can he be absorbed into the mainstream of American life if we do not do something special for him now, in order to balance the equation and equip him to compete on an equal basis? 60 I do not suggest that King is properly characterized as a proponent of affirmative action policies, or that the 1960s civil rights movement is necessarily conceived as favoring such policies. But it is at best historical to suggest that King opposed such policies, or that his statements suggest a principle of colorblindness whatever its purposes and effects. 
B. 
Many people in the academy now challenge "categories," or "categorical thinking," or "binary oppositions," 1 and it seems plausible to suggest that these challenges are perceived, in many quarters, as an outgrowth of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Generally, it is said that "categorical thinking" is a problem and that it is important to move beyond "binary oppositions" of various sorts. More particularly, it is said that the opposition between black and white treats as opposed two categories that are interdependent and mutually overlapping. The same, it is said, is true for gender. The division of human beings into "two kinds," male and female, is said to be a binary opposition that is oppressive because it is too simple.62 The general and the particular claims are united through the view that insisting on sharp categorical differences is perniciously hierarchical." 
In the context of both race and sex, the challenge to sharp categorical differences is based on something true and important. People are not simply black or white; as a matter of genetic fact, they have complex and mixed racial and ethnic ancestries. Consider the fact that the plaintiff in Plessy v. Ferguson"-Plessy himself-was only one-sixteenth black. There is a separate point. Race becomes an important social category only because of what society deems important. For young children, racial differences do not "code"--do not have the same meaning-in the way they do for adults in America. At least some of the same points might be made for gender, though the issue here is more contentious. Certainly no one could deny that there are men and women, or that there are important differences between men and women, many of them biological. But gender makes the social difference that it does in part because of social and legal practices.65 
But we may grant all this without accepting the view that binary oppositions or categories are themselves problematic. In fact thought itself proceeds through categories. We cannot make distinctions-between justice and injustice, equality and inequality-without categories or binary oppositions. We cannot distinguish between categorical thinking and its opposite (whatever that may be) without reference to categories. The problem with the challenge to categories and binary oppositions is that the challenge loses sight of the moral and political foundations of the attack on racial inequality. In fact it loses sight of the civil rights movement's point. To challenge categorical thinking is to abandon the moral foundations of the movement, which was not an attack on categories as such, but on particular categories that were pernicious for particular reasons. There is no reason to suppose that categories are themselves the problem, or that we could or should proceed without them. Thought itself depends on categories. Indeed, a challenge to categorical thinking cannot really get off the ground. 
Ideas of the sort I am challenging have not been irrelevant to law. Consider, for example, Roberto Unger's attack on "contexts" and his advocacy of "context-smashing," an attack that assumes that fixed contexts are themselves the problem.66 It seems plausible to think that 
kinds." See BUTLER, supra note 62; THOMAS W. LAQUEUR, MAKING SEX: BODY AND GENDER FROM THE GREEKS TO FREUD (1990). 
THE SERVICE OF RADICAL DEMOCRACY (PART I OF POLITICS, A WORK IN CONSTRUCTIVE SOCIAL THEORY) (1987); ROBERTO M. UNGER, THE CRITICAL LEGAL STUDIES MOVEMENT 109-11 the influence of Unger's work is connected to its apparent connection with the radical movements of the 1960s. But I think that the idea of "context-smashing" as such makes little sense. Some contexts are of course unjust, but this is not because of their status as contexts. It is because there is something substantively wrong with them. The civil rights movement was not challenging contexts, or fixity, as general independent evils. It was taking racial inequality as a particular evil. 
It is far from clear that the civil rights movement should be taken to have implications for constitutional law. Perhaps social movements of this kind bear on politics but not on law. This is certainly a reasonable view. On the other hand, the civil rights movement, and Martin Luther King in particular, have been prominently used in constitutional argument. As we have seen, King's "I have a dream" speech has been used to give moral weight to the constitutional attack on affirmative action.67 I think that most generally, the movement suggests a particular understanding of the issue of racial equality. It grows directly out of the attack on racial caste. I offer a few words on that understanding here. My goal is to offer a generalization, or a reading, of what participants in the civil rights movement of the 1960s were attacking. 
The motivating idea behind an anticaste principle is that differences that are both highly visible and irrelevant from the moral point of view ought not without good reason be turned, by social and legal structures, into systematic social disadvantages. A systematic disadvantage is one that operates along standard and predictable lines in many important spheres of life, and that applies in realms that relate to basic participation as a citizen in a democracy. There is no algorithm by which to identify those realms. As a provisional working list, we might include education, freedom from private and public violence, income and wealth, employment, political representation, longevity, health, and political influence. (Recall the analogous list in the Port Huron Statement.) The anticaste principle suggests that with respect to basic human capabilities and functionings,6 a one group, defined in terms of a morally irrelevant characteristic, ought not to be systematically below another. (1986). For more detailed criticism along the lines suggested here, see Cass R. Sunstein, Routine and Revolution, 81 Nw. U. L. REV. 869 (1987). 

Aristotelian Social Democracy, in LIBERALISM AND THE GOOD 203 
In the areas of race discrimination, a large part of the problem is this sort of systemic disadvantage. A social or biological difference has the effect of systematically subordinating members of the relevant group-not because of "nature," but because of social and legal practices. It does so in multiple spheres and along multiple indices of social welfare: poverty, education, political power, employment, susceptibility to violence and crime, and so forth. By pointing to these variables, it should be clear that I am not stressing economic variables alone, though these are indeed important. I am instead suggesting reference to a broad and eclectic set of social indicators. 
Consider in this regard-and also by way of comparison to the similar effort in the Port Huron Statement-the Human Development Index in the United Nations Development Program's 1993 Human Development Report.6 9 The index, based on longevity, educational attainment, and per capita income, is itself somewhat crude.7 0 But it is highly revealing that the United States as a whole ranks sixth; that white Americans by themselves would rank first; and that blacks by themselves would rank thirty-first (next to Trinidad and Tobago).7 1 
As Martin Luther King and Malcolm X both emphasized, systematic differences of this kind help produce frequent injuries to selfrespect-the time-honored constitutional notion of "stigma." A particular concern is that self-respect and its social bases ought not be distributed along the lines of race. 2 When someone is a member of a group that is systematically below others, and when the group characteristic is highly visible, insults to self-respect are likely to occur nearly every day. An important aspect of a system of caste is that social practices produce a range of obstacles to the development of self-respect, largely because of the presence of the highly visible but morally irrelevant characteristic that gives rise to caste-like status. 
Of course the law cannot provide self-respect, at least not in any simple or direct way. But group membership tends to fuel a cycle of discrimination, 3 in which, for example, employers rely on statistical discrimination; group members adjust their aspirations to this reliance; statistical discrimination becomes all the more rational; and so on. That is an aspect of the caste system to which the legal system is attempting to respond. It can operate largely because the high visibility of the group-based characteristic. If the characteristic were not

JOHN RAWLS. POLITICAL LIBERALISM (1993). 

No. I] visible, the same pattern could not occur.7 ' And because the stigmatizing characteristic is highly visible, it will probably trigger reactions from others in a wide variety of spheres, even in the interstices of everyday life." Highly visible characteristics are especially likely to be a basis for statistical discrimination and to fuel prejudice from third parties. Consider stereotypes about the physical characteristics of members of religious minorities, and compare this description of attitudes in prerevolutionary America: 
So distinctive and so separated was the aristocracy from ordinary folk that many still thought the two groups represented two orders of being. . . . Ordinary people were thought to be different physically, and because of varying diets and living conditions, no doubt in many cases they were different. People often assumed that a handsome child, though apparently a commoner, had to be some gentleman's bastard offspring. 76 
In the area of race, daily denials of basic respect, usually based on prejudice of some sort, are a large part of what it means to have a caste system. With blacks, for example, dark skin color is associated with a range of stereotypes that can have harmful effects during encounters with shopkeepers, employers, police officers, businesses, coworkers, and much more. These encounters rank among the injuries that the civil rights movement of the 1960s was attempting to eliminate. I suggest that an anticaste principle is a reasonable "reading" of its animating spirit. 
It is important as well to note that any such principle is most plausibly used by legislative and executive bodies, and that the focus of the civil rights movement was on those bodies as well. Courts should play a secondary role. They lack the power of initiative, the fact-finding capacity, and the democratic legitimacy to bring about systematic social change on their own.77 On this count participants in the 1960s movement were very much on the right track. Their substantive goals were well-connected with this institutional choice, and with their lack of emphasis on the judiciary as the foundation for social reform. 
III. 
DEHUMANIZATION 
I must now venture into somewhat more difficult and speculative territory. It has to do with issues of character, and with the way that different issues because homosexuality is not readily visible. 
Critics at Brown University (Mar. 11, 1994). 
we characterize and interact with people with whom we disagree, or even people that we consider fundamentally different, or oppressors. 
Begin with the opening quotation from Tom Hayden, which reveals a part of the picture. Hayden writes that it is time to "reassert the personal." Often it is said, and revealingly so, that the "personal is the political. ' 78 This slogan means that personal issues, especially in the area of sex equality, can be a product of political issues. Individual insults and injuries may connect with the distribution of political power; individual insults and injuries may cause the harm they do only because of the distribution of political power (consider the issue of sexual harassment). But the converse is also and equally true; the political may be the personal, in the sense that one's claims about politics are often a product of one's personal issues as well. We need not speculate about psychological forces in order to recognize this point. The second quotation from Hayden, writing in 1988, makes things very clear. On Hayden's retrospective view, personal desires of a certain kind ("defining not only yourself, but also your life by risking your life") were dominant, and civil rights claims were in a sense quite secondary. To put things a bit crudely, an important aspect of the 1960s movement, especially among white student activists, consisted of the playing out of personal issues in political guise. (This does not of course disparage the political claims, which stand or fall independently of their origins."9 ) 
There is a deeper point. In many radical movements, those who seek social change sometimes portray themselves as more than human, while they portray their enemies as less than human, or as fundamentally other than human. Or they define both themselves and their opponents just in terms of what separates them, so that there are no other common links. Often, of course, this is a strategy of those seeking to promote or maintain racial inequality; consider the rhetoric of the Nazi Party, or of the Ku Klux Klan. But the same strategy is often used by people who are seeking to overcome discrimination and oppression."0 Hence there was a tendency in the 1960s civil rights movement to dehumanize certain groups of people-to refuse to see them as human beings, or as individuals with narratives, sufferings, and life histories of their own.

dehumanization by oppressed people. The first involves an unjust goal, the second (by hypothesis) does not. But along the dimension I am discussing, the two phenomena are the same. 
We can see an example in Malcolm X's frequent description of his oppressors as the "white man"-as if there were only one. Recall the quotation at the beginning of this essay: "We're all black to the white man." In fact Malcolm X used singular and plural forms throughout his writing and speaking for rhetorical effect. Compare his statement also quoted at the beginning of this essay: "[W]e're a thousand and one different colors. Turn around, look at each other!" This "looking" at particularity works, ironically, to establish common ground. We can see something similar in Malcolm X's reaction to the assassination of President Kennedy, to the effect that the "chickens [have] com[e] home to roost.""1 The oddity of the reaction comes from the fact that Kennedy's own personal history-his own life, his family, his own role in promoting or undermining racial equality-was treated as quite beside the point. 
Martin Luther King insistently avoided this form of dehumanization. Instead he attempted at all times to combat it. In doing so he raised two different points: the effects of this distinctive form of hatred on those who hate, and the erasure of particularity and individuality that is brought about by group-based hatred. Thus King wrote, I have also decided to stick to love. . . . I'm not talking about emotional bosh when I talk about love, I'm talking about a strong, demanding love. And I have seen too much hate. I've seen too much hate on the faces of sheriffs in the South. I've seen hate on the faces of too many Klansman and too many White Citizens Councilors in the South to want to hate myself, because every time I see it, I know that it does something to their faces and their personalities and I say to myself that hate is too great a burden to bear. I have decided to love.8 2 Thus King wrote, "Hate is just as injurious to the person who hates. Like an unchecked cancer, hate corrodes the personality and eats away its vital unity."8 " 
But most of King's response was connected with the need for particularity-with the need for humility, and for seeing each person as an individual. In his view, this understanding was interestingly connected with a commitment to universality. Rejecting sharp polarities between good people and bad people, he said, "[T]here is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us. When we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies." Thus he wrote, "The one thing about bitterness is its blindness. Bitterness has not the capacity

In his famous statement after his trip to Mecca, Malcolm X spoke in terms that assert both particularity and universality, in a way that connected with some of King's own writing. Thus Malcolm X said: 
During the past eleven days here in the Muslim world, I have eaten from the same plate, drunk from the same glass, and slept in the same bed (or on the same rug) with fellow Muslims ... whose eyes were the bluest of blue, whose hair was the blondest of blond, and whose skin was the whitest of white. And in the words and in the actions and in the deeds of the "white" Muslims, I felt the same sincerity that I felt among the black African Muslims of Nigeria, Sudan, and Ghana. 
We were all truly the same ....8' 
On this score it will be useful to close with the final discussion in a very popular book on the 1960s, Destructive Generation8.7 The authors are Peter Collier and David Horowitz, former editors of a leftwing magazine, Ramparts, turned Reagan Republicans. The book ends with an anecdote. The authors sought out Susan Sontag, who had recently delivered an influential speech whose theme is captured in its title: "Communism Is Fascism with a Human Face." Collier and Horowitz, staunch anti-Communists, praised Sontag for that speech, but "[w]arming to the occasion," pressed her for having republished without critical comment a 1969 essay about Communist North Vietnam, in which Sontag appeared to praise communism. Collier and Horowitz asked Sontag why she had not offered "further challenges to the adversary culture's conventional wisdom about America and democracy." (Note the terms "adversary culture" and "conventional wisdom.") Collier and Horowitz added that Europe had produced Hitler, and that it was America that had rescued Europe "from the barbarisms of the East."

Sontag responded, "I'm not really interested in having this discussion. You're just projecting your own Manichaean politics onto the world. I don't want to enter your world, where you push everything to extremes." The book ends with a suggestion that Sontag "was right-we did push things to extremes." But according to the authors, her "judgment on us was also a judgment on her and others who understood the political stakes but didn't push things far enough." 
What may be especially interesting is that in their incarnation as 1980s Reagan Republicans, Collier and Horowitz showed the same character and sensibility as they showed in their incarnation as 1960s student radicals. This is a character and a sensibility that is attracted not only to sharp and simple distinctions between good people and evil people, and not only to an unduly clear sense of precisely which people stand with us and which stand against us, but also and precisely for the same reason to a form of dehumanization. The seeds of violence can usually be found here. 
Some people think that America has had one or perhaps two constitutional "moments"; others think that the New Deal qualifies as a third such moment, or even that America has had a large number of constitutional moments. In my view, any such picture is somewhat artificial-useful for heuristic purposes, but much too simple for reality. Our constitutional development has been jagged and somewhat unruly. It has many of the characteristics of a common-law process, punctuated by periods of public upheaval, in which the common-law process becomes less cautious and incremental than it usually is. The civil rights movement of the 1960s was one such period of public punctuation, and its principal actors were, in that sense, constitutionmakers. The meaning of the civil rights movement has yet to be settled. But it is hardly adventurous to say that the period has had a significant and continuing influence on our understanding of the American political order, and that debates over its meaning and significance will help determine the meaning of that political order in the future. I have suggested that an insistence on the deviation between ideal and reality, or freedom from desperate conditions, opposition to caste, and caution about the judiciary were defining features of the civil rights movement. It should not be too much to suggest that those commitments ought to play a large role in similar movements in the future.
