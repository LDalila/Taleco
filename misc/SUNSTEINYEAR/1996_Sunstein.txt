Congress, Constitutional Moments, and the Cost-Benefit State 
Cass R. Sunstein* 
In this article,Cass Sunstein exploresthe 104th Congress' attempts at regulatory reform. ProfessorSunstein believes that the election of this Congress, with its distinctive approachto government,signals the dawning of a "constitutional moment" in which the role ofgovernment at all levels will be reexamined. Without full public supportfor sweeping changes in government, this moment has not yet materialized. When and ifit does, regulatory reform will be one of its aspects. Indeed the nation has alreadybegun to examine regulation to determineifthe benefitsjustify the costs. Unfortunately, the 104th Congress has, thusfar,failed adequately to address this burgeoning cost-benefit state. Sunstein claims that Congress'failurereflects its inability to redesign the massive federalregulatoryscheme. He suggests that the executive branch should oversee regulatoryreform, with Congressrelegatedto providingbroad policy direction. Sunstein also suggests that Congressadopt an Administrative Substance Act, building upon the recent learning about the performance of regulation and modeled after the AdministrativeProcedureAct. Sunsteinfurther callsfor the enactment of a "substantivesupermandate"requiringa general background rule of cost-benefit balancingfor allfederal regulation; but he contends that any description of costs and benefits should reflect the full range of diverse values expressed by the public at large. * Karl N.

INTRODUCTION 
The 104th Congress promised to change the national government in fundamental ways. Spurred by widespread popular dissatisfaction with government, the House of Representatives attempted to rethink national institutions more deeply than at any time since the New Deal; in fact the New Deal itself was a central target of the process of rethinking. America may be on the verge of a constitutional moment in which Americans answer foundational questions in novel ways.' 
The election of the 104th Congress signalled the transformation of America into a genuinely post-New Deal regulatory state. This emerging nation remains in a process of development; but it may be described as a cost-benefit state, one whose performance will be assessed, both in particular and in general, by comparing the costs of government action with its benefits. This idea requires a good deal of specification, but it unites developments not only in the national legislature, but in the executive branch, the judiciary, and state government as 2 well. 
My purpose here is to evaluate the efforts of the 104th Congress to give legal form to this constitutional moment. My particular interest is Congress' effort to reform the modem regulatory state. Charged by a popular mandate for reform and a high level of ambition, Congress debated both substantive and procedural "supermandates" cutting across all federal regulation. 3 Thus the 104th Congress devoted a large part of its agenda to "rethinking the regulatory state." The Contract With America also promised to address basic regulatory issues. 4 In large-scale hearings, Congress examined problems of overregula1. I borrow the idea of a constitutional moment from Bruce Ackerman, who proposes a "dualist" approach to constitutional interpretation-an approach that claims that America has witnessed two types of decisions: foundational ones made by the American people and more ordinary ones made by their representatives. 1 BRUCE AcKEImsAN, WE Ta PEOPLE: FoUNDATIONS 6 (1991). A constitutional moment is a period of popular development of principles that results in revolutionary reform. Id. at 21. Ackerman identifies three such moments in American history: the Founding, Reconstruction, and the New Deal. Id. at 58; see also text accompanying notes 16-34 infra. 
form. See Exec. Order No. 12,866, 3 C.F.R. 638 ( that agencies assess the costs and benefits of a regulation before adopting it); Exec.

Order No. 12,291, 3 C.F.R. 127 (1982), reprinted in 5 U.S.C. ยง 601 ( outweigh its costs) (revoked 1993). On the role of cost-benefit balancing in the courts, see Motor Vehicles Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins., 463 U.S. 29, 54-55 (1983) (endorsing cost-benefit analysis for automobile safety standards regarding automatic seatbelt systems); Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA, 947 F.2d 1201, 1215-17 (5th Cir. 1991) (rejecting EPA's ban on asbestos because EPA failed to adhere to its statutory mandate to impose the least burdensome solution). On state and local government, see TED GAEBLER & DAVID OSBORNE, REINVENTING GoVERNMENT: How Tm ENrmPRNmUIAL SPIRIT Is TRANSFORnmiNo a PUBLIc SECTOR (1991) (advocating that government at all levels should be reformed to behave more like the private sector).

By the close of the first session, however, relatively little had happened. There was no constitutional transformation for a simple reason: The public has not (yet) called for one in the way that American institutions require. To be sure, the House passed eleven major pieces of legislation in two monthsincluding the Congressional Accountability Act,7 the Line Item Veto Act s and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.9 But only six of those measures were enacted into law. The Balanced Budget Amendment 10 passed the House but faced defeat in the Senate, as did tax legislation, welfare reform, a new crime bill, and term limits legislation. The Line Item Veto Act and litigation reform passed the House and Senate in different forms, but await the work of conference committees, stalled in the case of the line item veto by the Republicans' reluctance to give this power to President Clinton." 
All in all, there was a great deal of noise and bluster-a great deal of signalling-but surprisingly little in the way of concrete results. In the end, the enacted measures proved modest and mostly procedural. The apparently more ambitious proposals contained some good features. But many of their provisions were crude, unimaginative, and far more procedural than advertised. Rather than reflecting new and better thinking about substantive regulation, these provisions represented an effort to clog the administrative process with paperwork. In fact, members of Congress sometimes appeared to misunderstand the content of the very legislation they were debating. Congress revealed only a partial awareness of the recent outpouring of research on regulationresearch that could have produced the basis not only for fundamental change, but also for a consensus cutting (more or less) across partisan lines. Congress' emphasis on cost-benefit analysis showed a healthy appreciation for balancing rather than absolutism; but it was only a start. Congress may well have laid the groundwork for future developments. But because of its own institutional weaknesses and the system of checks and balances-including above all bicameralism and the possibility of presidential veto-actual changes will take more time. As a practical matter, these institutional weaknesses significantly hamper Congress' ability to produce a constitutional moment in the context of the modem regulatory state. 
Both institutional and substantive lessons will emerge from this article. On the institutional side, I claim that Congress is quite ill-equipped to produce sensible, constitution-like reform, at least if it tries to offer details. With respect to regulation, a group of generalist representatives-all with numerous issues to address, few with particular expertise in regulatory law, and many beholden to special interests-is not in a position to produce desirable, largescale reforms, unless it restricts itself to generalities. Such a group is prone to sharp internal divisions that are not subject to reasonable mediation without a good deal of specialization in regulation. Indeed, the task of producing constitution-like change in the modem state is far more difficult than it was in the New Deal era. It is easier to create a regulatory state than it is to dismantle one, especially in an era in which every industrialized nation is committed to controlling the operation of the marketplace. 
reinforced by recent experience. As we will see, the 104th Congress was split between two different sets of interests: technocratic forces seeking to discipline agency decisions with better policy analysis and forces of reaction seeking to stop agency action even when it would improve social well-being. There is thus an interesting contrast between the performances of Congress and the executive branch. Even those who reject President Clinton's approach to regulation should recognize that his administration has shown far more sophistication and creativity in this area than Congress. 12 (The same is true for the adminis12.

trations of Presidents Reagan and Bush. 13) The executive branch has been highly attuned to the need to compare costs and benefits, to attend to results rather than processes, and to enlist the private sector in engineering least-cost solutions. Improvements in regulatory performance are more likely to come from the executive than from a Congress saddled with its institutional deficiencies. Perhaps Congress should give substantial discretion to administrators, allowing them to design appropriate regulatory tools and perhaps to set priorities as well.14 Indeed many current problems result from statutes that either produce poor incentives or forbid more imaginative, cheaper, and more effective solutions-or that ban cost-benefit balancing altogether.' 5 
we now have: a system containing both economic and democratic failures, where priorities are not set carefully and where interest groups wield excessive power over government. Certainly it is important to provide methods for assessing regulatory performance. At least in principle, some form of cost-benefit analysis could simultaneously promote political accountability and regulatory efficiency. In this way, it could be part of a system of deliberative democracy. But any movement toward a cost-benefit state should be accompanied by an understanding of the importance of public judgments in regulatory law, the limits of the criterion of private willingness to pay, and the need to 1995 (press release), available in WESTLAW, Pres-Daily Database.

create market mechanisms that do not place excessive informational demands on government. 
More specifically, I suggest that a general requirement of cost-benefit analysis would indeed be a constitution-like amendment, and a highly undesirable one, if it is understood in the most ambitious possible way: as an effort to ensure that all regulatory statutes are implemented by reference to the principle of economic efficiency based on the criterion of private willingness to pay. Regulatory measures have diverse foundations, and many legitimate statutes are not rooted in the efficiency criterion at all. 
If cost-benefit analysis is understood more modestly as an effort to require balancing rather than absolutism, it is a good idea and should generally be required. But so understood, cost-benefit analysis can be specified in many different ways. Congress should give appropriate guidance so that agencies can make reasonable rather than unreasonable specifications. I offer some suggestions about how these tasks might be accomplished; to this end I emphasize qualitative as well as quantitative factors, public judgments about risk, and the highly diverse foundations of regulatory enactments. 
This article comes in four parts. Part I examines the popular shift in the perceived role of the national government-a shift that may yet culminate in a constitutional moment. Part I also outlines what has been learned thus far about regulation. Part II describes what the 104th Congress proposed and summarizes this failed constitutional moment. Part III explores how the principal proposals might be improved. Part IV addresses the future of the cost-benefit state. 
II. 
The New Deal was of course a substantial reformation of the original constitutional structure. 16 It qualifies as a substantial reformation above all because it refashioned the three basic cornerstones of that structure: federalism, checks and balances, and individual rights. 17 
In the 1930s the powers of the national government were expanded in an extraordinary way, in favor of a system that exercised something close to general police powers.' 8 The original understanding of a sharply constrained cen16.

regulate interstate commerce broadly to include the regulation of private activity that may indirectly affect commerce); see alsoPERSONAL PRESIDENT supranote 17, at 49-50 (discussing the judicial ratification of the government's expansive powers). tral government was therefore repudiated by the nation. There were simple grounds for this repudiation. First, state autonomy seemed an obstacle to democratic self-government, not a crucial part of it-especially in the midst of the Depression, when states were generally perceived as ineffectual entities buffeted by private factions. As a result of the New Deal, state autonomy was very different in 1940 from what it had been in 1920. 
Second, the system of checks and balances came under sharp criticism. To many observers, especially during the Depression, that system seemed dysfunctional and anachronistic in modem society. 19 Effective businesses do not operate through checks and balances; why should government paralyze itself in this way?20 In response, Congress delegated enormous policymaking power to the President and created a large number of powerful executive and independent agencies.2 ' Crucially, Congress designed these agencies to limit the consequences of the system of checks and balances by allowing a high degree of administrative autonomy. Thus the new agencies had a large degree of discretionary authority under open-ended statutory standards. They also combined traditionally separated powers of adjudication, execution, and legislation. 
These institutional shifts resulted from a critical national judgment made during the Depression: that individual rights, properly conceived, included not merely the common law catalogue of private interests, but also governmental protection against many of the harms and risks of a market economy. These harms and risks included unemployment, poverty, malnutrition, homelessness, lack of education, and hopelessness as a result of disability.22 Indeed the common law catalogue seemed overprotective as well as underprotective, for it was unduly solicitous of private property. The common law was a regulatory system enjoying no special status; it should be evaluated pragmatically and in terms of its consequences for the human beings subject to it. Here it often seemed to fail. Hence the national government was authorized to engage in a wide range of redistributive policies. 
If the New Deal qualifies as a constitutional moment, it is because of its revolutionary redefinition of constitutional commitments. 23 Indeed, an astonishing feature of the New Deal was its relative rapidity. Many changes came in the brief period from 1932 through 1936, and were clearly supported and ratified by the public. Such rapid change was possible partly because it is a relatively simple step for a legislature to create a range of new bureaucratic institutions, at least if the legislature does not specify each agency's duties in advance. In fact, the New Deal entities operated with little statutory guidance; Congress usually contented itself with open-ended delegations of authority.24 As we shall see, the relative simplicity of the New Dealers' task contrasts dramatically with the complexity of the task faced by the 104th Congress. 25 Moreover, in the early 1930s the public's support for the New Deal was broader and deeper than public support for fundamental change in the 1990s-though the public may unite behind such change before long. 
The New Deal reformation served as the foundation for the basic orientation of the national government until the election of President Ronald Reagan. One development during that period has been of special importance: the "rights revolution" of the 1960s and 1970s, which reinforced many New Deal tendencies through the creation of a remarkable array of new agencies. These agencies were designed to protect against threats to life, health, and safety from consumer products, workplaces, and, above all, to protect the environment.26 Economic arguments about external harms reinforced claims for new statutory "rights." Hence this period saw the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Consumer Protect Safety Commission, the Council on Environmental Quality, and several other administrative agencies. 
It is notable that during both the New Deal and the rights revolution, no mechanism was created to evaluate regulatory performance. No system assessed whether agencies were making things better or worse. In the New Deal, any such system might have seemed peculiar in light of the widespread national enthusiasm for the President and for the possibilities of benign administration. In addition, cost-benefit thinking was largely foreign to political actors, and hence cost-benefit analysis played little or no role in public debate. No mechanism existed to protect against the possibility that "government failure" would replicate "market failure." 
One of the most striking features of the period since 1980 has been sustained national criticism of the New Deal reformation. In light of the election of the 104th Congress, this criticism may well be signalling the first genuinely foundational challenge to American government since the New Deal itself. The Contractwith America clearly suggested that large-scale change was at issue. It is worthwhile to pause over the constitution-like character of recent challenges to the current governmental structure. Critics often suggest that the naienced a constitutional moment. If the term is seen as a metaphor, rather than a legal term of art, it is sufficient to work from more abstract and intuitive ideas of the sort described in the text. 
PuBLic Autorrry 132-33 (Ist ed. 1969) (describing the perceived need for broad authorizing statutes as government expanded its powers). 
tional government has far exceeded the appropriate limits of its authority and argue for a return to the original structure.2 7 Many assert that a devolution of power to the states would promote both democratic and economic goals;2 s the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act and Congress' recent interest in "block grants" for states to use basically as they wish reflect this criticism.2 9 
In this way there is a wholesale attack on the existing allocation of authority between the national government and the states. But "horizontal" issues of government structure are receiving similar attention. Concerned about the extent of policymaking discretion given to regulatory agencies, many suggest that Congress should reassert its constitutional prerogatives by narrowing administrative discretion. 30 It is urged that the New Deal's enthusiasm for independent bureaucracy, and for a large lawmaking role for executive agencies, should be revisited, and that Congress should make the fundamental choices of policy. 
Finally, and perhaps most fundamentally, pre-New Deal principles of private right have enjoyed a rebirth with the suggestion that modem regulatory programs violate liberty, rightly conceived. 31 These principles play a significant part in current debates, as reflected in arguments in favor of removing constraints from the marketplace and imposing new compensation obligations on government. 32 Thus the movement for deregulation has become far more sweeping than it was in the Reagan period. The Takings Clause has become a rallying cry for a new enthusiasm for the protection of private property-challenging such well-established federal programs as the Endangered Species Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act's protection of wetlands. 
Some criticisms of regulatory performance have been far narrower and more pragmatic in character, focusing less on basic theory and more on the economic consequences of regulation. It is here that cost-benefit balancing, accompanied by risk analysis, has played a special role. As I have noted, the New Deal period was accompanied by no mechanism for monitoring regulatory performance. But it is now suggested that national government has failed to perform the tasks assigned to it and has often made things worse.33 In this view, there is no suggestion that markets are ideal; but often markets work better than the regulatory programs designed as solutions. Increasingly, assessment of regulatory performance has taken the form of cost-benefit analysis. 34 
If we are indeed in the midst of a constitutional moment, it began with the election of President Ronald Reagan and was spurred by the dramatic and largely unanticipated shift in the direction and composition of the Congress in the 1994 elections. The Contract With America presented the electorate with a set of promises for fundamental reform. The importance of the Contract should not be understated, for it helped to organize a formerly unruly House of Representatives and provided public benchmarks against which the House would be measured. It is clear that in the 104th Congress, the House of Representatives acted in a remarkably rapid and sweeping fashion, offering the Senate a chance to make the most significant changes in the national government since the New Deal. The Senate declined the opportunity, largely because the public showed its uncertainty about such far-reaching change. If the nation follows the Senate's course, the effort at constitutional revision will have failed. But any predictions on this count are premature. Let us turn, then, away from theory and toward more pragmatic issues involving the performance of the regulatory state. 
B. 
In the last decade, something very close to a consensus has emerged on some of the most important problems in existing government regulation. If government were to act on this consensus, it would introduce important changes. Those changes need not amount to anything like a constitutional moment; here we are not speaking of the most basic constitutional commitments. But the changes would be far from a mere matter of tinkering. The consensus has the following features. 
As we will see, measurement of costs and benefits can be highly controversial. But under any measure, there can be no doubt that resources for risk reduction are badly allocated.3 5 As much as $500 billion may be spent each year on regulation,3 6 and of this amount, more than $130 billion is spent on (claiming that the mattress flammability standard resulted in a substantial increase in costs, but no statistically significant increases in consumer safety); Sam Peltzman, Toward a More General Theory of Regualtion, in CHICAGO Srtmms N PoLmcAL EcoNoMY, supra, at 234 (explaining the problem of diffuse interests that allows small groups to exert control over regulatory agencies); George J. Stigler, The Theory ofEconomic Regulation, in CHICAGO STUins iN POLITICAL EcONoMY, supra,at 209 (arguing that regulatory agencies created to protect the public often succumb to interest group pressures).

eliminate small public health risks); Richard H. Pildes & Cass R. Sunstein, Reinventing the Regulatory State 62 U. Cm. L. RE. 1, 4 ( 
( environmental protection alone.37 A recent study suggests that better allocation of health expenditures could save 60,000 additional lives at no increased cost, and that, alternatively, we could maintain the current number of lives saved with $31 billion in annual savings.3 8 
This overall spending pattern includes serious and apparently unjustified 39 asymmetries in life-saving expenditures among the areas of regulation. For example, compare transportation safety regulation, which costs a median of $56,000 per life-year saved, to occupational safety regulation, costing a median of $350,000 per life-year saved, and environmental regulation, costing a median of $4,200,000 per life-year saved. 40 These variations are compounded by variations in the effectiveness of safety standards within each area. 41 Annual lives saved are highly variable. In transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration's seat cushion flammability regulation saves thirty-seven lives each year, while the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's passive restraints/belts regulation saves no fewer than 1,850 lives annually; in occupational safety, OSHA's hazard communication regulation saves 200 lives per year, OSHA's oil and gas well service regulation saves fifty lives per year, OSHA's grain dust regulation saves four lives per year, and OSHA's formaldehyde regulation saves 0.010 lives per year; and in environmental safety, EPA's asbestos regulation saves ten lives each year, while EPA's land disposal regulation saves 2.5 lives per year.42 
Of course calculations of costs and benefits are somewhat speculative, and these numbers are only estimates. But with better allocation of resources and more deliberative judgments, much could be improved. Consider Table 1, which certainly does not capture all relevant factors-it does not even describe total benefits-but which is at least highly suggestive of poor resource allocations. 43 
In addition to this apparently inconsistent structure, the goal of achieving sensible priority-setting is undermined by the fact that agencies have substantially different standards for deciding when risks are large enough to require any regulation at all.44 For example, the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends that environmental factors be regulated when calculated to cause an incremental cancer risk of about 3 in 1000, for those exposed over a lifetime. American agencies do not follow this recommendation, and national practices are highly variable. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission mandates regulation where incremental cancer risks exceed 1 in 1000; the EPA does so when the risk exceeds an acceptable range that varies from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 1,000,000.4 5 
The FDA set its standard at 1 in 1,000,000, but courts have interpreted the Delaney Clause to require a standard of essentially zero.46 
OSHA interprets the "significant risk" requirement in its governing statute to mean that an incremental cancer risk of 1 in 1000 will initiate regulation;4 7 labor groups have sought to require regulation when the risk is 1 in 1,000,000. As we will see, a single number may not make sense in light of different contextual judgments. 48 But in the face of these variations, good priority-setting is unlikely. 
than rigid commands. 
Too often government regulates through rigid commands, precluding industries from using more flexible and cost-effective measures that achieve the same goals.49 For example, in air and water pollution control, the rigid "best available technology" approach,50 which mandates control technologies for hundreds or even thousands of firms, gives industries little incentive to improve existing pollution control technologies. Incentive-based systems could save billions of dollars. 51 Yet in spite of the potential advantages, efforts to seek better regulatory tools are hobbled by the statutory status quo, which either forbids such tools or engrafts them onto a bureaucratically complex system.52 cost. 
A study based on data from 1984 suggests that the EPA's "netting" emissions trading program saves between $525 million and $12 billion each year.5 3 The Clinton Administration calculates that its market-oriented proposals for amending the Clean Water Act could save between $1 and $12 billion over alternative approaches.5 4 Thus studies show that incentive-based mechanisms for controlling air pollution could have accomplished the same result at one-quarter the 55 
Encouraging companies to disclose information is an especially valuable incentive-based approach to risk regulation. If companies offer information about risk, consumer and worker behavior will probably be affected.5 6 The national government has offered many initiatives in this direction. Consider in particular the Toxic Release Inventory of the Superfund Amendments, which requires companies to publish annual reports detailing the amount of toxics they release into the environment. This program has been highly successful, spurring voluntary reductions at relatively low costs. Reacting to public concern about the information in these mandatory disclosures, many companies have voluntarily pledged to reduce toxic releases. 57 A great deal of work remains to be done in conceiving and designing appropriate informational approaches to risk.5 8 
consequences of regulations. 
Many regulatory initiatives result in harmful unintended consequences. Under the existing regulatory system, there is no systematic way to ensure that those consequences receive attention.5 9 Hence regulation tends to be based on partial perspectives that emerge from close attention to mere pieces of complex problems. This myopic approach ignores the importance of ensuring that regulation does not have unexplored side-effects or increase harms or risks on balance. 60 A particular problem arises from "health-health" tradeoffs, which arise when regulation of one health risk increases another health risk.61 Suppose, for example, that elimination of asbestos, a carcinogenic substance, makes cars less safe because asbestos is the best substance to use in making brake linings. 62 Or suppose that the ban on asbestos encourages companies to use even more dangerous substitutes. 63 It is pervasively true that controls on one risk may increase another risk. Unfortunately, risk regulation is not designed with this problem in mind. 
An incipient literature deals with a related issue. It suggests that regulatory expenditures can profoundly affect social well-being and actually cost health and even lives. Regulatory expenditures may produce greater unemployment by increasing production costs and decreasing profits. Unemployment breeds poverty, which, in turn, breeds poor health and increased mortality rates. A 1990 study developed a model to quantify the common sense view that "richer is safer."' 4 The study suggests that a regulatory expenditure of $3 million to $7.5 million may cause a statistical fatality.65 
In a concurring opinion in a 1991 D.C. Circuit case involving an occupational safety and health regulation, Judge Williams invoked this evidence to suggest that OSHA's refusal to engage in cost-benefit analysis might not be beneficial for workers. 66 Judge Williams reasoned that if a fatality results from an expenditure of $12 million, some regulations might produce more fatalities than they prevent. 67 As Table I illustrates, many regulations do cost more than $12 million per life saved. In Judge Williams' view, an agency that fails to measure the overall social costs against benefits falls accurately to measure mortality gains against losses. 
The claimed relationship between wealth reductions and mortality is controversial.68 But a number of studies find such a relationship and indicate that regulations may, in fact, cause more fatalities than they prevent. Consider the following summary of studies showing a causal relation between wealth and 69 mortality: unlikely to translate into significant, aggregate health impacts).

This work is in its initial stages, and any findings should be taken with many grains of salt.70 But certainly it would be good for government to know about unintended adverse consequences and to try to counteract them to the extent feasible. Unfortunately, there is now no systematic mechanism by which government regulators are made attentive to harmful unintended consequences. 
Often government lacks information about the harms that regulation is designed to counteract. Often it must act, or fail to act, in a context of considerable scientific uncertainty. 7 1 Without accurate data, any exercise in quantification can be illusory,72 giving the impression of far more knowledge than people actually have. 
In these circumstances government should place a high premium on acquiring as much accurate information as possible. Much of the relevant information can be found in the private sector, which is best equipped to determine actual emissions levels and the costs of risk control. But the current regulatory structure does not create incentives to compile accurate information about risks. Indeed, it creates incentives to distort the facts. Hence industry faces incentives to report costs that are far higher than reality73 and is not encouraged to compile more information than is already available. 
regulatingrisks. 
It seems clear that government should respond to reasonable judgments about risk; but whose judgments should be counted as reasonable? Countless studies show systematic differences between expert and citizen judgments about risk.7 4 This is one of the most robust findings in an extensive litera70. See Portney & Stavins, supra note 37, at 118-19 (advocating use of cost-benefit analysis because the theoretical limitations of health-health analysis make it less useful in practice).

between experts and laypersons). ture.75 The following table summarizes the results of a national opinion poll in which experts and citizens ranked environmental health risks.7 6 
A recent study in Canada shows similar results. 77 It reveals that the Canadian public sees cigarette smoking and motor vehicle accidents as far less dangerous than do Canadian toxicologists. It also shows that the public ranks many risks higher than do toxicologists; the most dramatic disparities along this dimension involve chemical pollution, ozone depletion, nuclear waste, food additives, pesticides in goods, and PCBs. 
What accounts for these differences? Some are simply attributable to citizens' ignorance of scientific facts. This ignorance has many sources, including sensationalist media reports and heuristics that produce systematic biases. 78 process of congressional review might also deter agencies from submitting illconsidered or faction-driven regulations to Congress. Moreover, agencies might more frequently signal to Congress that some statutorily mandated regulations make little sense, and the process of review might lead Congress to change the relevant statute.20 7 It is in part for these reasons that President Clinton expressed enthusiasm for congressional review. 20 8 
It is unclear, however, how much this provision would add, since Congress can already enact legislation to prevent any and all regulations from becoming law. There are risks as well. A serious problem with congressional review is that it might, in practice, give well-organized interest groups a chance to bring pressure to bear on hundreds or even thousands of regulations. In this way it might increase rather than decrease the problem of factional influence. 20 9 Section 801 would also require Congress to expend limited resources reviewing a wide range of agency rules, many of which should be uncontroversial. 
The competing considerations do not lead to any obvious conclusion. But a new statutory provision for congressional review adds nothing to Congress' existing authority. Setting up a formal mechanism for review of regulations is probably too costly and time-consuming to be worthwhile; narrower "reporting" strategies could accomplish the same goals. Hence section 801 might well impose costs that are not justified by benefits. 
Modest Changes2 10 
How might Congress improve the proposals mentioned above? I begin with some modest changes designed to accomplish Congress' apparent goals in a more effective manner. 
Some theoretical issues. If a substantive supermandate is to operate as a kind of constitutional amendment to the regulatory state, it seems crucial to understand what cost-benefit balancing actually entails. Much of the national debate in the last year involved the value of cost-benefit analysis. Proponents characterized cost-benefit analysis as a method of disciplining administrative power through salutary balancing; opponents feared that cost-benefit analysis cold-heartedly sacrifices human health and life for the sake of mere dollars. But this is at best a caricature. By itself, the notion of cost-benefit analysis appears very close to empty; everything depends on how costs and benefits are characterized and on how underlying issues of valuation are resolved. 2 11 
Two criticisms can be made of a proposed framework (or supermandate) for evaluating governmental performance. The first is that the framework is wrong because it ignores certain important variables, or is founded on an indefensible theory of value. The second criticism is that the framework is incompletely specified, in the sense that its meaning depends on further subsidiary judgments that have yet to be offered. Cost-benefit analysis is properly subject to the first kind of criticism to the extent that it purports to align values along the single metric of aggregated private willingness to pay-and evaluates regulation by reference to that criterion alone. Indeed, regulation might be founded on citizen judgments that have no clear parallel in aggregated willingness to pay.2 12 Or it may be rooted in distributive rather than allocative goals; consider the antidiscrimination laws as possible examples. To the extent that cost-benefit analysis is rooted in the technical economists' understanding, it has a great deal to offer, but it cannot capture many appropriate goals of regulation. 
As a political creed, however, the principal problem with cost-benefit analysis is that it is incompletely specified. Its meaning depends on how costs and benefits are characterized and on how issues of valuation are resolved. Do equitable concerns enter the cost-benefit calculus? Suppose, for example, that a certain environmental risk is concentrated among African-Americans. 21 3 Can a good cost-benefit analysis take this into account? Or suppose that some of the benefits of regulation are aesthetic. How will these benefits be valued? An extensive literature explores the valuation of human life.2 14 Though, by itself, cost-benefit analysis takes no position on the associated controversies, regulators asked to operate under cost-benefit analysis must take some such position. 
With these points in mind we can ask the general question: Would a general requirement of cost-benefit analysis be a sensible supermandate for the regulatory state? 
Would such a requirement be like a constitutional amendment, or would it be a modest way of disciplining agency discretion? 
The most basic point here is that the modem state includes a diverse array of regulatory statutes, with diverse legitimate purposes, including but not at all limited to economic efficiency. 
Consider the following: " Many important regulatory states are plausibly understood in terms of economic efficiency; 2 15 they can be seen as efforts to counteract market failures. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act 2 16 and the Toxic Substances Control Act2 17 are examples. Such statutes may be designed to overcome an absence of sufficient information; harms to third parties; or collective action problems of various sorts.218 " Some statutes are designed to eliminate illegitimate discrimination or what might be understood as caste-like features in modem society.2 19 Though some people think that such statutes can be defended on efficiency grounds, 22 0 their animating impulse has little to do with economic efficiency. " Some statutes are designed to protect cultural aspirations. 2 21 Examples include measures safeguarding the national parks, encouraging high-quality programming, and protecting endangered species. " Some statutes are designed to redistribute to the poor or to others understood as having a good claim to public help. This is so even though regulation is a poor tool for this purpose,22- and though redistribution may really benefit well-organized interest groups with little claim to public assistance. The Social Security Act is an obvious example of redistributive law; the Agricultural Adjustment Act can also be understood in this way, with appropriate qualifications for its interest-group dimensions. 
Doubtless other possibilities could be mentioned. 223 The point is that the highly diverse grounds for federal regulation raise many questions about costbenefit analysis as the only ground for regulation. 
If it is intended as a quasi-constitutional amendment to the regulatory state, a cost-benefit supermandate could be understood in at least three different ways. In its most ambitious form, the mandate would amount to an endorsement of the principle of economic efficiency as the exclusive basis-the "decision criterion"--for interpretation and application of all statutes.2 2 4 This would be a fundamental change both because it would understand cost-benefit analysis in a particular way-as a term for the criterion of economic efficiency-and because it would amend statutes that, when enacted, seemed motivated by something other than the efficiency criterion. 
If this were the understanding of the supermandate, all of the statutes to which the supermandate applies would henceforth be understood in efficiency terms. To say the least, this would be a dramatic shift in national understandings. It would indeed represent a kind of constitutional amendment of the administrative state, rebuilding regulatory efforts on a new foundation. While the most ambitious reformers in the Senate and the House came close to this view, none endorsed it explicitly. 
Another, less ambitious possibility is to understand the cost-benefit criteria in efficiency terms, but only for those statutes that were designed to promote economic efficiency. Under this approach, the supermandate would not alter the basic understandings of existing statutes. It would instead have a more modest but nonetheless important goal: imposing a particular understanding of technocratic rationality on statutes formerly understood and implemented in a less precise, more ad hoc, and more intuitive way. As we will see, there is much to be said in favor of this basic approach. 
A third and least ambitious possibility is to understand cost-benefit criteria in a less technical and more common-sensical way, as an invitation to balance a range of variables under statutes that had formerly been thought to be absolutist and hence to forbid balancing. On this view, a supermandate would not be so ambitious as to call for the use of purely economic criteria. It would more modestly ask administrators to look at costs, or adverse effects, as well as at benefits. This was probably the goal of the majority of those members of Congress who were in favor of a substantive supermandate. And if the supermandate is understood in these terms, it makes a great deal of sense. As we will see, the principal objection to such a supermandate is that it is too openended. Congress can and should take steps to clarify it, though-I emphasize-without mandating the efficiency criterion outside of the context of "market failure" statutes.225 
The House and Senate bills offered almost no guidance for characterizing costs and benefits, and no guidance at all on the crucial issue of how to value best justificatory apparatus for demarcating the scope of state power from the area of individual choice"). Even when economic efficiency is not the basis for the statute, or when benefits cannot be quantified, it makes sense to require agencies to quantify costs to the extent that this is possible. costs and benefits. For this reason, the provisions look highly substantive but are in fact largely procedural. Without guidance to constrain valuation, a requirement of cost-benefit analysis is quite open-ended, though certainly not meaningless. It alerts agencies to the need to balance a range of considerations and as a procedural requirement, it will affect outcomes. Moreover, courts may invalidate outcomes that, by general understandings, seem either out of line with existing practice or too absolutist. 226 Certainly there is a difference between agency behavior under balancing statutes and agency behavior under statutes that forbid balancing. 227 
It is possible to conclude that Congress should restrict itself to a call for cost-benefit analysis and leave the details to agencies.228 Perhaps Congress lacks the detailed understanding that would enable it to answer the more specific questions. But if we are at all concemed about administrative discretion, we should urge greater guidance from the national legislature.2 29 In any case the generic bills introduced in the House and Senate would be much improved if they offered more direction to agencies. I offer two suggestions here. 
aggregate amount of lives saved, but also about a range of factors involving the nature of the particular risk. For most people, the most salient contextual features are: ( uncontrollable; ( (4) whether the risk is voluntarily incurred; ( distributed or concentrated on identifiable, innocent, or traditionally disadvantaged victims; (6) whether the risk is well understood; (7) whether the risk would be faced by future generations; and (8) whether the risk is familiar.2 30 
Any cost-benefit analysis that Congress requires regulatory agencies to perform should reflect these factors. In developing a cost-benefit formula, Congress should recognize that a purely quantitative or monetary understanding of costs and benefits is inadequate. The various consequences of regulation ought not to be thought commensurable along a single metric. 23 1 Any cost-benefit analysis should be accompanied by a disaggregated, qualitative description of the consequences of government action, so that Congress and the public can (rejecting an EPA asbestos regulation issued under the Toxic Substance Control Act because the agency failed to consider less burdensome alternatives).

identifying qualitatively different effects, and taking account of effects on diverse groups"). obtain a fuller picture than the crude and misleadingly precise "bottom line" of the cost-benefit analysis. 232 This is not at all to deny that it is important to be precise and quantitative when possible. It is only to say that any "bottom line" characterization and assessment of costs and benefits will involve judgments about values, not about science; Congress and the public should see what those judgments are. 233 
I have suggested that regulatory statutes have legitimate and diverse functions and that some of those functions do not involve economic efficiency. For this reason, the efficiency criterion is inadequate as a complete guide to the regulatory state. It is therefore best for Congress to understand costs and benefits in the economic fashion only for statutes that are designed to overcome market failures. And even here, there is room for qualifying the economic analysis-when, for example, the risk at issue is inequitably distributed, and when political actors believe that it deserves special attention for that reason.2 4 When the statute does not involve market failure, Congress would still require cost-benefit balancing as the general background rule; but it should understand the definition of costs and benefits to be sufficiently broad as to allow administrators to depart from purely economic criteria. Judicial review should be available to police administrative decisions for reasonableness and consistency.2 35 In the long run, it might be hoped, a common law of regulatory practice might emerge to create rationality and reasonableness where there is now a high degree of arbitrariness.

The list is not exhaustive, but does provide agencies an opportunity to account for diverse public judgments.

Congress should, however, attempt to impose some constraints on agency valuations and tools, as I will now discuss. 
Floors and ceilings. It is of course troublesome to assign dollar values to life, partly for the reasons I have sketched. But since tradeoffs of multiple kinds are inevitable, it may be best for Congress to set out some guidelines, including floors and ceilings governing expenditures, without pretending to say how much a life is "really worth." In light of the diversity of regulated risks, no single number would make sense for valuing life. 237 But it may make sense to set benchmark standardsof, for example, $10 million per life saved as the presumptive maximum amount and $3 million as the presumptive minimum. These benchmarks might be accompanied by explicit permission for agencies to select a lower or higher amount if the agency can explain that special circumstances call for it. 
There is a crudeness, however, in the very notion of "dollars per life saved." A well-functioning regulatory state should not be interested in how many lives are saved, but in how many statistical years, or how many decently liveable statistical years, are added by regulation.23 8 An agency would do better to save forty statistical years than it would to save three, even though, through both steps, it might be taken to have "saved a life." Where resources are limited, it makes sense to devote resources to saving people who have the most good years ahead. This judgment may appear controversial, but it seems supported by common sense and economic criteria.239 Hence Congress should probably set floors and ceilings not for lives saved but for life-years saved, with permission to depart on the basis of justifications that are articulated publicly and are reasonable on the merits. For life-years, a presumptive ceiling of $500,000 might be a reasonable place to start. Of course any floors and ceilings should be accompanied with adjustments for inflation. 
Without a figure per life or life-year saved, agencies effectively have discretion to weigh costs and benefits however they wish. Congress should offer some guidelines to achieve consistency across agency lines. At a minimum Congress should require agencies to be explicit about their valuations, so that these valuations will be subject to legislative and public oversight and review.

We have seen that there is a pervasive problem in risk regulation, one that is only now receiving public attention, and one that was not adequately addressed in the proposals before the 104th Congress.2 40 The problem occurs when the diminution of one risk simultaneouslyincreasesanotherrisk.24 1 For example, fuel economy standards, designed partly to reduce environmental risks to life and health, may make automobiles less safe, thus increasing risks to life and health. Regulations designed to control the spread of AIDS and hepatitis among health care providers may actually cost lives by increasing the costs of health care, and thus making health care less widely available.2 42 Regulation of nuclear power may make nuclear power safer; but by increasing costs, such regulation promotes reliance on other energy sources, such as coal-fired power plants, which carry risks of their own.2 43 The general problem is ubiquitous. 
this problem. Congress should consider a new provision to this effect: "( create countervailing risks that are greater than those of regulated risks. (2) This section shall not apply if it is inconsistent with the provisions of the enabling statute pursuant to which the agency is acting." 
Such a provision would require agencies to ensure that overall risks are not increased. It would not fundamentally change current law. But it would be a modest step toward a more coordinated treatment of risk.244 
Thus far I have offered modest suggestions that build on existing proposals. Three more ambitious strategies would accomplish a great deal more.

increase the executive's role in priority setting. 
As Justice Breyer suggests, a statute could give the executive some degree of authority to divert public and private resources from small environmental problems to large ones, ensuring greater cost-effectiveness in government and better priority-setting. 245 There are some dangers with this proposal-a small group of bureaucrats should not have the authority to decide on basic social priorities. Nonetheless, a greater degree of executive priority-setting would make sense. 
Justice Breyer's approach should be qualified by remembering that people are legitimately concerned with the various contextual factors discussed above-the voluntariness of the risk, its potentially catastrophic character, whether it is especially dreaded, whether it is equitably distributed, and so forth.24 6 Efforts at better priority-setting received some modest attention in the 104th Congress; but the proposals were not very ambitious. 24 7 
Often the problem with federal regulation is that the government lacks knowledge of the least expensive means of producing the preferred regulatory end. If the private sector were permitted to select the means, it could do so far more cheaply. This point has been recognized in Europe and Japan, under the general rubric of "environmental contracting." 248 In the Netherlands, for example, the government has experimented with comprehensive, multimedia environmental targets for pollution reduction and has developed strategies to work with industry groups to achieve overall goals. 249 As part of the agreement with industry groups, the government agrees to waive otherwise applicable pollutant-by-pollutant regulations, and to limit changes in requirements during the length of the contract period. 
In the United States, the EPA has taken modest steps in the same direction. For example, the EPA and Amoco concluded that a plantwide approach would better decrease chemical releases than the existing command-and-control system. 5 0 Similarly, under the Clean Air Act, companies can, in essence, "contract out" of technology-based regulations for six years if they achieve a 90 environmental law "proved to be especially fertile ground" for agency experimentation).

percent reduction in toxic pollutants before the EPA promulgates relevant regulations. 2 5' 
Under most federal statutes, however, the EPA cannot approve private plans as substitutes for public mandates, even if the plans promise better results for less money. Congress should move in the direction of allowing private substitutes, so long as government monitoring is maintained.2 52 A provision of the June discussion draft of the Dole bill endorsed this strategy, but because its relationship to other statutes was quite ambiguous, it was unclear whether the provision would enable agencies to waive existing statutory requirements. 2 53 
We have seen that command-and-control regulation can be highly dysfunctional. Sometimes relevant statutes forbid agencies from choosing incentivebased strategies even where such strategies would be more effective. Congress might move away from command-and-control regulation by enacting a statute stating: "Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an agency shall be permitted to use economic incentives to induce industries to eliminate or reduce risks, if it can show that these methods will produce at least equivalent benefits in a more cost-effective manner."2 54 Of course, such a provision could increase the risk of litigation initiated by self-interested private groups seeking to stall desirable regulation.2 55 It could also allow agencies unenthusiastic about regulatory mandates to proceed with less effective means of achieving compliance. But despite the potential for abuse, the problems with existing command-andcontrol processes-excessive costs and insufficient regulatory benefits25 6-are probably sufficient to make it worthwhile to move in this direction. 
In the area of regulatory reform, and particularly in the context of health, safety, and the environment, a number of creative ideas are percolating throughout the nation. These ideas have already had effects on legislation; they will have increasingly significant consequences inthe coming years.

One possibility, captured in many of the current proposals, is to shift in the direction of cost-benefit balancing for all statutes. Many current statutes forbid balancing and call for absolutism. Such an approach is not easy to justify.257 Thus the various statutes that are defined in terms of health or technology might be amended to call for cost-benefit analysis.2 58 As we have seen, this shift-in the direction of a cost-benefit state-responds to several current problems with regulation. Moreover, it is important to offer some criteria by which to monitor regulatory performance, and cost-benefit analysis is probably the best available technique for embarking on a form of "national performance review." 
By itself, however, a shift towards cost-benefit analysis would be only a modest improvement over the status quo. We have seen that, as an abstraction, cost-benefit analysis lacks a theory of value. If this defect is remedied in the economist's fashion, by rooting cost-benefit analysis in the economic criterion of private willingness to pay, it becomes quite controversial and indeed hard to defend as a global approach. Environmental amenities are not best valued by aggregating private willingness to pay.259 
Apart from the question of valuation, engrafting a cost-benefit requirement onto current law is only a modest shift; it does not represent a sufficiently fundamental change from the system of command-and-control regulation. Because the calculation of both costs and benefits can be enormously difficult, requiring agencies to make the necessary inquiries will impose large informational burdens on government. A general requirement of cost-benefit analysis allows legislators to take credit for "getting the regulators under control" without making the hard choices. Such a credit-claiming device hardly substitutes for reinvented government.

REv. 1267, 1273-75, 1279 (1985) (criticizing proponents of cost-benefit analysis for their unrealistic assumption that all environmental conditions and control strategies can be known). It is of course possible that cost-benefit analysis would itself fail costbenefit analysis; thus technology-based approaches could be justified as a response to government's lack of information and proper incentives. Similarly, it is possible that health-based standards can be justified by their aspirational and political values-providing a benchmark to which even dirty places may aspire. These ideas do not, however, argue against the background rule I defend above. See text accompanying notes 226-244 supra. 
pay); text accompanying notes 272-276 infra. plan based on governmental balancing is no less a five-year plan than one based on governmental absolutism. 260 Governmental dictation of outcomes based on cost-benefit analysis is better than governmental dictation based on absolutism, but neither is ideal. A system in which agencies decide what is to be done only after considering all costs and benefits is likely to be time-consuming and will inevitably produce large-scale errors. Such a system imposes enormous data collection requirements on agencies and also forces them to make difficult, and hardly scientific, judgments about basic values. This approach may well be attractive to members of Congress seeking reelection, but it is not a great deal better than the status quo. 
In fact it would be easy to imagine a generation of dreary cycles with respect to regulatory reform. In those cycles, conservatives might call for more balancing of costs and benefits, more procedures, and fewer deadlines for administrators; liberals would then argue against cost-benefit analysis and for health-based or technology-based standards, fewer procedures, citizen suits for regulatory beneficiaries, and stricter deadlines; conservatives, a few years later, would seek greater procedural requirements and more attention to costs; liberals would respond with the familiar litany; and so on until, say 2050. 
Although this cyclical model is not a bad description of the regulatory debates since 1980, its continuation would represent an enormous failure of imagination and creativity. It would fix American policy in the outmoded debates of the early 1970s, before the outpouring of learning that makes the "more" or "less" debate seem so unhelpful. A cost-benefit state ought not to content itself with governmental specification of outcomes after governmental cost-benefit judgments have been made. It ought instead to create incentives for nongovernmental actors to generate information and to produce outcomes based on incentives generated by democratic judgments. 
In the last decade many people have enthusiastically embraced "pollution prevention" as the regulatory strategy of choice.261 On this view, government should eliminate pollutants from the market rather than require pretreatment or impose technological requirements to reduce the harmful effects of pollutants. Prominent examples of pollution prevention include the elimination of lead from gasoline; the phaseout of chlorofluorocarbons; government bans on DDT, can be justified partly on the ground that individuals have far better relevant information than does government. See F.A. HAYEK, Tim CoNsTuToN oF LmERTY 106-120 (1960).

PCBs, and asbestos 262; the shift from high-polluting fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy sources; and restrictions on mercury pollution in the Great Lakes and phosphate pollution in local rivers. 
Why is pollution prevention so attractive to so many people? Enthusiasts contend that by preventing the production or use of certain pollutants, government can make much more progress in reducing pollution than it can by imposing technological controls or fixes. 263 The proper analogy, it is said, is to the contrast between prevention and cure. We know that cures tend to be both more expensive and less effective than preventive measures. American government has focused on cures; it should shift to prevention. From this perspective, the basic cause of environmental degradation is current technology, above all fossil fuels and modem cars. At the same time, the capacity of technology to diminish its own environmental damage is rapidly becoming exhausted. Instead of imposing decreasingly effective technological fixes, would it not be better to take steps to ensure that environmentally harmful substances are not produced at all? 
Often the answer to this question is affirmative; often pollution prevention is both feasible and appropriate. 264 But as a global approach, pollution prevention is inadequate. 265 In some cases pollution prevention would impose extremely high costs-including environmental costs-for little environmental or other gain. Recall here that a federal court of appeals invalidated one of the most ambitious of the recent pollution prevention strategies-the ban on the manufacture and use of asbestos--on the ground that: (a) the benefits of the ban could not, in many sectors, be shown to justify the costs and (b) the ban on asbestos could itself produce a variety of environmental and health-related problems stemming from the use of environmentally inferior substitutes.266 
This example can be duplicated in many other contexts. Indeed the goal of pollution prevention, if taken literally, would be a social disaster. For example, an immediate and wholesale shift to electric cars might seem the best way to prevent air pollution from motor vehicles. But electric cars are now extremely expensive, and the costs, for workers and consumers, of a ban on contemporary automobiles would plainly be excessive. In fact, electric cars produce environ262.

In these circumstances, pollution prevention is sometimes worse than costbenefit analysis or economic incentives. By imposing a direct cost on polluting activity, economic incentives can identify the circumstances in which prevention or cure makes the most sense. For example, fees imposed on the production of sulfur dioxide may lead some companies to eliminate sulfur dioxide; in any case the judgment would be left to (appropriately constrained) market forces. Alternatively, cost-benefit analysis might show that pollution prevention is not worthwhile. 
The appropriate conclusion is that pollution prevention is often a good regulatory strategy, but that it cannot be adopted in all or even most contexts. Whether it is the best solution depends on the pollutant in question, the available substitutes, and the effects of the preventative approach. 
Much creative thought has been dedicated to using "free markets" as a mechanism for promoting environmental and other goals. 268 To free market advocates, the problem of environmental degradation stems from a simple fact: the absence of secure property rights in environmental amenities.2 69 The creation of secure property rights tends to reduce environmental problems. 
There is much truth to this suggestion, and there is considerable promise to the resulting proposals. If environmental assets were owned, so that owners faced the full costs of excessive development, it is likely that excessive pollution would be prevented. In many settings, free market environmentalism points in promising directions. Consider, for example, possible amendments to the Endangered Species Act, related to proposals introduced in the 104th Congress. In its current form, the Act creates difficult problems for any landowner who discovers that his land contains a critical habitat for an endangered or threatened species. Discovery of such a habitat subjects the property to a range of limitations.270 Hence a landowner has an incentive either to lie about the facts or to proceed with development as rapidly as possible to avoid the constraints of the Endangered Species Act. It would be far better to use market approaches so that landowners are rewarded rather than punished by a discovery that threatened or endangered species need their land.27 1

For two reasons, however, free market environmentalism is an incomplete solution. First, it is not always possible to assign ownership rights. Consider, for example, the problems posed by acid deposition, the greenhouse effect, and the destruction of the ozone layer. Economic incentives, based on market thinking, may be preferable to command-and-control measures; but it is difficult to imagine a system in which private ownership rights are fully allocated. 
The second reason is more theoretical. Free market environmentalism depends on the view that the market paradigm should be deemed normative for purposes of environmental protection. Thus the key question becomes how much people, as consumers, would pay for environmental amenities. 272 The answer to that question defines people's "choices" and "values." Indeed, for free market environmentalists it is hard to imagine how choices and values might otherwise be understood. 
But it is wrong to take private choices, expressed in the market domain, as definitional of preferences. 273 Private willingness to pay in the market domain reflects a particular setting; it does not reflect global choices or valuations.2 74 The choices people make are a function of the particular role in which they find themselves. As consumers, people make choices that diverge from those they make as citizens. The appropriate kind and degree of environmental protection raise issues that should be discussed by citizens offering reasons for one or another view. This democratic conception of environmental protection competes with the market-oriented view. Of course, a democratic approach to environmental law will use market incentives in many contexts, partly because of the advantages of market incentives on simple democratic grounds. 
existing habits, and these should probably be changed; indeed, in the environmental context they had better be.2 75 Consider, for example, the issues posed by littering and recycling. Social norms with respect to these issues have shifted dramatically in the last generation. Thus the act of recycling is now, in many communities, taken for granted, where a decade ago that same act was perceived as odd or fanatical. Or consider smoking. A principal issue here is whether smoking is promoted or undermined by social norms. Large reductions in smoking among African-American teenagers appear to have been Hearings Before the Subcomm.

( construct social meaning); Sunstein, supra note 274. brought about by changes in social norms.276 A prime purpose of environmental law is to shape norms and habits. The central weakness of free market environmentalism is that it removes this issue from the agenda. 
A final approach would base regulatory law on people's reflective judgments, as citizens, about their basic goals. On this view, the most significant problems in the current system consist of interest-group power, myopic responses to sensationalist anecdotes, and inadequate information. A market-oriented understanding of the regulation is inadequate because it fails to provide a forum for public deliberation. Similarly, a purely technocratic conception is inadequate because it devalues the need to rely on people's reflective judgments.2 77 More specifically, the technocratic approach fails to reflect the various qualitative factors that influence public judgments about risk-whether a risk is voluntarily incurred, equitably distributed, potentially catastrophic, especially dreaded, and so forth.2 78 And as we have seen, there is a difference between the judgments people make as citizens and those they make as consnmers; in principle, the former are the relevant judgments with respect to public policy. 
A good model for democratic environmentalism is the Emergency Planning and Community Involvement Right-to-Know Act,2 79 which requires the creation and publication of a list of release levels for each of more than three hundred toxic chemicals that exceed threshold quantities. 280 The result is a Toxic Release Inventory, an annual EPA report of toxic chemical releases that summarizes the relevant information. The publicity has two desirable consequences. First, the Toxic Release Inventory gives states and localities the information needed to decide whether to act at the governmental level. The Toxic Release Inventory thereby spurs decentralized political action. Second, public reaction to the publication leads many companies to pledge to make voluntary reductions. Thus the Monsanto Corporation pledged a ninety percent cut within four years, and AT&T established a goal of eliminating all toxic air emissions by the turn of the century; many other companies have produced new waste reduction initiatives as well.2 8'

For democratic environmentalists, 28 2 much of the promise of economic incentives lies in the fact that they promise to reduce interest-group power by removing attention from the question of means, which is so clearly a recipe for interest-group struggle. Economic incentives also have the advantage of focusing the public's attention on the right questions. 28 3 Hence the acid deposition provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act are a model for the future because they reflect a democratic judgment about outcomes. 28 4 The much-criticized (and internationally much-imitated) National Environmental Policy Act285 is also a model from the democratic point of view, insofar as it requires the disclosure of environmental consequences before the government can act,2 86 and in that sense spurs political (but not judicial 28 7) safeguards. It is especially important to ensure that public judgments are adequately informed. A system in which the public responds to misleading and sensationalistic anecdotes only parodies democratic aspirations.28 8 
Of course these are stylized discussions of abstractions that must be applied to complex policy initiatives. It is best to approach particular problems in a pragmatic and experimental manner. All four approaches have something to offer, and they can be combined in different ways to arrive at the best solution. In cases involving dangerous substances with good substitutes, the argument for pollution prevention is overwhelming. Where private ownership is possible, free market environmentalism may well be preferable to the alternatives, notwithstanding the theoretical objections offered above. In some situations, cost-benefit balancing at the government level is unavoidable. We may believe that for reasons associated with democratic environmentalism, a strong commitment to the protection of endangered species makes sense. But even if this is so, it may be best to use market-like instruments to accomplish democratic goals-through, for example, "habitat credits" that reward rather than punish landowners who discover that their land supports the continued existence of an endangered species. 2 89 
Some of the most promising modem initiatives are rooted in democratic judgments, but at the same attempt time to harness private initiative and market forces in the interest of those veryjudgments.

See id. at 160. accommodate both free market and democratic environmentalism, nominally opposed foundations that could make a creative rapprochement. This is the direction in which the most productive reforms might lead. They would produce a kind of cost-benefit state, but one that is neither purely technocratic nor entirely founded on the willingness-to-pay criterion. In such a state, regulatory outcomes would be founded on value judgments that are reflective, reasoned, and democratically developed. An approach of this kind would synthesize emerging enthusiasm for technocratic tools and for decreased cost with the basic American commitment to deliberative democracy. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
The election of the 104th Congress, together with the Contract with America, signals that the nation may be in the midst of a constitutional moment. At the very least the 104th Congress raised more fundamental questions about the national government than at any time since the New Deal. Most of the key initiatives were passed by the House but floundered in the Senate. The public never authoritatively committed itself to such fundamental change, and hence the constitutional moment, though signalled, failed to occur. Whether it will happen in the future depends on the judgments of the American peopleon whether those judgments will be made with the firmness that American institutions require. 
Even if regulatory reform does not become part of a constitutional moment, the nation is embarking increasingly on the project of assessing government performance by asking whether the benefits justify the costs. The regulatory state is becoming something like a cost-benefit state; this is an unmistakable feature of public life in many institutions of American government. In light of the chaotic and uncoordinated character of modem regulation, this is in many ways a salutary development. But it is only a start, above all because the abstract ideas of "cost" and "benefit" need to be specified by some theory of value. In the 104th Congress, legislative debates over regulatory reform were mostly procedural and unimaginative, trapped in an increasingly pointless discussion of whether "more" or "less" regulation is desirable. In the end, almost nothing happened. 
To be sure, some proposals would have improved the modem regulatory state by reducing regulatory excesses and encouraging better priority-setting. In addition, the deliberative process of the Senate reflected a learning process in which poorly conceived provisions were deleted 290 and better alternatives were proposed. 291 But for the most part, these proposals were far less sophisti290. See for example, the Glenn bill, which preserved the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory program in its entirety; this bill was defeated by Senate Republicans.

1995). cated and creative than those that emerged from the executive branch, including the "reinventing government" working groups. 
A general lesson emerges from this phenomenon. In the last fifteen years, the executive branch has embraced a form of cost-benefit analysis for specific purposes-to promote better priority-setting, to move towards market-oriented tools, to exempt de minimis risks, to attend to informed public judgments, to foster voluntary and least-cost compliance, and to focus on ultimate results rather than methods and processes. To be sure, there is much to criticize in the efforts of the executive branch.292 But all in all, they are quite promisingcertainly more so than the various bills that attracted so much attention in the 104th Congress. 
As we have seen, balancing is preferable to absolutism. The point is especially important in light of the fact that with respect to the protection of human health, absolutism may actually be counterproductive and hence far from what it seems.293 But cost-benefit balancing is an abstract idea that needs specification, and it is insufficient to graft a supermandate of "balancing" on top of a structure of command-and-control regulation. Future congressional debate over the regulatory state should not remain frozen in a discussion of whether regulation imposes excessively high costs (it surely does) or whether more should be done to protect people from a range of harms, including risks to life and health (it surely should). Too many proposals in the 104th Congress reflected too little of the learning of the last twenty years of experience. Embodying instead the unhelpful (though accurate) judgment that there is "excessive" regulation, they attempted to clog the administrative process with paperwork. 
There is an institutional lesson from all this: Congress is not well-equipped effectively to redesign the regulatory state. The executive branch, with its cadre of experts in numerous substantive areas, is in a better position. For this reason it may be best for Congress to limit its efforts to providing broad signals about what is wrong and to allow the executive branch, within limits, to provide solutions. Statutes that permit or require economic incentives, and that call for suitably constrained balancing, may be the best that Congress can do. 
But there is a substantive lesson as well. If there is to be an Administrative Substance Act, it should build on the foundation laid by recent learning about regulatory performance. In the process it would be possible not only to save billions of dollars unnecessarily wasted on current programs, but also to save many thousands of lives. 
A constitutional moment of the sort signaled by the 104th House of Representatives deserves far more reflection and scrutiny than the House itself was willing to give it. And a cost-benefit state will have many questions to answer, OF REGULATORY ANALYsIs INTE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY 165-75 (1991) (evaluating the regulatory analysis conducted by various executive branch agencies). See also OFFCE OF POUCY ANALYsis, EPA, REP. No. EPA/23012-871025a, UNFINSHED Busnwss: A CoMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF ENviRoNmENTAL PROBLEMS 94-100 (1987) (challenging the focus of EPA's regulatory priorities through a comparison of the risks associated with thirty-one major environmental problems). 
especially on underlying questions of valuation. I have suggested that a general background requirement of cost-benefit balancing-a substantive supermandate-should be enacted. I have also suggested that this background rule can and should be rejected through clearly expressed legislative judgments in particular statutes. In describing costs and benefits, Congress should allow room for a diverse array of values, and not limit agencies to the criterion of private willingness to pay. Many statutes require or permit agencies to promote goals independent of economic efficiency, and such statutes are entirely legitimate. Legislation that would amend all such statutes in favor of the efficiency criterion would indeed be quasi-constitutional in nature. But in a well-functioning deliberative democracy, such legislation would be hard to defend on the merits. 
More modestly, an Administrative Substance Act, amending the regulatory state, should include the background requirement I have described and also require agencies to act in a cost-effective fashion. Congress should move as well in the direction of requiring economic criteria where the underlying statute is best understood as remedying a market failure, economically defined. A cost-benefit state, understood in these terms, could make large improvements, without embarking on foundational reform and without answering the hardest questions, by offering initiatives that make sense under any reasonable theory of value. 
Constitutional Caution 
Begin with a platitude: When government attempts to regulate the market, many things may go wrong. In the familiar litany, regulation may be counterproductive, producing outcomes that defeat the aspirations of well-meaning reformers. Or, regulation may be futile, as the market adapts to the relevant initiatives. Or, regulation may produce unanticipated harmful consequences. All of these results may follow from the regulators' incomplete understanding of the system into which they are attempting to intervene. This is not an argument that government should never intervene in markets. But it is certainly a reason for caution, for attempting to acquire a good deal of information, and for proceeding in an experimental, nondogmatic way. 
It is less often recognized that constitutional law can have similar problems. Supreme Court decisions may be counterproductive. If it is understood as a case about gender equality, Roe v Wade' is a possible example since the Court's decision may well have damaged the effort to produce gender equality.2 Or Supreme Court decisions may be futile. Sometimes Fourth Amendment decisions seem to have this feature; it is far from clear that police officers comply as a matter of course with Supreme Court pronouncements about Fourth Amendment requirements. Supreme Court decisions may also have harmful unanticipated consequences. This is true, for example, of many efforts in the area of judge-led social reform.'

Justice Holmes's work on constitutional law was built largely on seeing the political process as a kind of market, subject, like other markets, to forces of supply and demand." As a regulator of the political market, the Supreme Court may reach decisions that reflect ignorance of relevant factors. Because they interfere with the political market, Supreme Court decisions may also disturb some kind of social equilibrium. It is ironic but true that many people alert to the problems with government interference with economic markets are quite sanguine about Supreme Court interference with political markets.' This was true in the 1920s when constitutional law assumed center stage in debates over regulation of new and old markets.6 It is true as the twenty-first century approaches, as constitutional law takes center stage in debates over new communications markets, prominently including the Internet. 
In some areas, the Supreme Court, firmly aware of its own limitations and perhaps aware of the marketlike nature of politics, operates casuistically. It avoids broad rules. It is aware of underlying complexities of both fact and value. In the area of affirmative action, this has been the Court's preferred course The Court has avoided simple rules. Its decisions have been highly case specific. The democratic process has been given a lot of room to maneuver. 
I suggest that this casuistical model makes sense for cyberspace.' This is so for two reasons. First, underlying values are in flux and not simple to sort out. There is, for example, a large debate over the regulation of pornography, especially pornography about and for children, on the Internet. There is also a large debate about the relationships among the Internet, children, and parental control.' It is also unclear that the Court's free speech doctrine-founded on the categories of viewpointbased, content-based, and content-neutral regulation-makes complete sense. If, for example, the government attempts to promote educational and public-affairs programming, it is acting on a content-discriminatory basis, but are its actions for that reason illegitimate? 
The problem is not limited to values. On the underlying facts, things are changing very rapidly, and courts know relatively little; but the facts are crucial to the analysis. The new communications technologies in general are a good example. If cable television flourishes, will ordinary broadcasters be at risk in a way that threatens free programming?" Courts are not likely to be in a good position to answer this question. This was the key problem in the Turner case,1 and while there is reason to think that interest-group pressures underlay the relevant statute, predictive issues are not, in general, well-suited to judicial resolution. In such circumstances the Court does best if it proceeds cautiously and with humility, allowing some room for political judgment and maneuvering in a setting that is in such flux. 2 
In the area of cyberspace, there is a related but more general issue. I believe that the First Amendment is sometimes playing substantially the same role with respect to the communications market as did the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to the labor market in the period from 1905 through 1936.13 In that period, questions about minimum-wage and maximum-hour laws, or efforts to protect labor unions, were answered in significant part by asking: What does the Due Process Clause say on such questions? 4 In retrospect we can see that this was a bad way to proceed-that it would have been much better to dispense with lawyers and cases and to focus instead on underlying questions of fact and value, questions for which purely legal tools are inadequate. The problems of policy should be solved by people who understand problems of policy, not by lawyers skilled in reading Supreme Court opinions.

To some extent, the same is true for cyberspace. Too often, hard questions are answered by consulting previous cases, as if the First Amendment, judicially understood, supplies the foundations for choosing regulatory policy for the emerging speech market. Of course the First Amendment has a good deal to say about legitimate regulatory strategies. Obviously, some such strategies would violate the First Amendment. But the relevant questions are first and foremost ones of policy rather than constitutional law; courts and judges would do well to remember this point. 
Consider a few examples. With the touch of a button, it is now possible to reach millions of people, whether or not they want to be reached. Libelous statements, commercial messages, hate speech, child pornography, threats-the cost of sending all of these to millions is very low. This simple fact may make it necessary to rethink constitutional categories. There has been particular concern recently about the free availability of sexually explicit materials on the Internet, especially in the context of materials soliciting, involving, or available to children."5 Perhaps the government should be allowed to regulate not only child pornography, and not only obscenity, but a somewhat broader range of materials because of the distinctive interest in protecting children.16 At least the Court's obscenity doctrine bears uncertainly on this question, and mechanical use of that doctrine may produce error. It is important to get a sense of the nature of the underlying problem before reaching confident conclusions. 7 5 The increasing attention being given to pornography on the Internet is evidenced by the fact that from Spring 1991 to January 24, 1994, Lexis-Nexis listed only 69 articles on this subject, as contrasted with 3,451 articles on this subject entered from January 24, 1994 to January 24, 1996.

Related issues are raised by the use of the Internet to circulate libelous, threatening, or sexually violent material about an identifiable person. It may well be that the easy transmission of such material to millions of people will justify deference to reasonable legislative judgments.18 
Suppose that the government intends to assist parental control by allowing families to "block" certain material and to prevent it from entering the home. This idea would bear an obvious resemblance to the controversial "v-chip" proposal that was recently enacted by Congress. 9 Through this enactment, Congress is requiring new televisions to be equipped with technology enabling parents to block certain programming. The requirement may substantially affect programming because of anticipated parental blocking; but this by itself is not constitutionally decisive. The existence of such an effect resulting from anticipated viewer behavior is part of a well-functioning market. Proposals of this sort would facilitate parental control, but would not involve federal content regulation; they would not involve direct governmental control or censorship of the speech market."0 Because they are noncensorial and facilitative, courts should treat them more leniently. 
The only serious questions include selectivity and bias: Is the government facilitating the exclusion of material of which the government disapproves? If so, the fact that no direct regulation is involved is not enough; impermissible selectivity would be objectionable by itself. Certainly it would be troublesome if the government enabled people to screen out material of a certain, governmentally disapproved content; imagine a governmentally mandated "Democrat chip" or "Gingrich chip" or "liberal chip." But the "v-chip" is best seen as lacking this feature. It would discriminate on the basis of content, not on the basis of viewpermission to exclude "indecent" programming),

In that case, the defendants sent sexually explicit e-mail to one another which contained the graphic description of the torture, rape, and murder of a classmate of one of the defendants. The government charged the defendants with transmitting threats to injure or kidnap another. The court dismissed the charges, finding that the descriptions contained in the e-mail were fiction and did not constitute a "true threat" under the statute.

For this reason it should probably be upheld, at least on an appropriate factual record demonstrating that the government is attempting to combat harm rather than content or viewpoint.2 What I am emphasizing here is that preexisting categories do not give clear guidance and that it is best for the courts to proceed in a cautious manner. 
Let me turn now to a question that has received considerable public attention and that particularly shows the need for a degree of judicial caution in using the First Amendment: the question of violent speech on the Internet." Applying ordinary standards, constitutional lawyers may well believe that this is a simple issue, settled by Brandenburg v Ohio.2 But things are more complex.

Gordon Liddy, speaking on the radio to millions of people, explained how to shoot agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms: "Head shots, head shots .... Kill the sons of bitches."24 Later he said, "[s]hoot twice to the belly and if that does not work, shoot to the groin area."25 On March 23, the full text of the Terrorist's Handbook was posted on the Internet, including instructions on how to make a bomb (the same bomb, as it happens, that was used in Oklahoma City)." By the time of the Oklahoma bombing on April 19, three more people had posted bomb-making instructions, which could also be found on the Internet in the Anarchist's Cookbook.27 On the National Rifle Association's Internet "Bullet 'N' Board," someone calling himself "Warmaster" explained how to make bombs using babyfood jars.28 Warmaster wrote, "These simple, powerful bombs are not very well known even though all the materials can be easily obtained by anyone (including minors)."29 After the Oklahoma bombing, an anonymous notice was posted to dozens of Usenet news groups listing all the materials in the Oklahoma City bomb, explaining why the bomb allegedly did not fully explode and exploring how to improve future bombs.30 
Fifty hate groups are reported to be communicating on the Internet, sometimes about conspiracies and (by now this will come as no surprise) formulas for making bombs.3 On shortwave radio, people talk about bizarre United Nations plots and urge that "the American people ought to go there bodily, rip down the United Nations building and kick those bastards right off our soil.""2 In fact, last year Rush Limbaugh, who does not advocate violence, said to his audience, "The second violent American revolution is just about, I got my fingers about a fourth of an inch apart, is just about that far away. Because these people are sick and tired of a bunch of bureaucrats in Washington driving into town and telling them what they can and can't do. 33 
In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, a national debate has erupted about speech over the Internet counseling violence or inciting hatred of public officials. 4 Of course it is unclear whether such speech has had a causal role in any act of bombing. But new technologies, and particularly the Internet, have put the problem of incitement into sharp relief. It is likely, perhaps inevitable, that hateful and violent messages carried over the airwaves and the Internet will someday be responsible for acts of violence. This is simply a statement of probability. The questions raised for constitutional lawyers are these: Is that probability grounds for restricting such speech? Would restrictions on speech advocating violence or showing how to engage in violent acts be acceptable under the First Amendment? And how do preexisting categories bear on the current issue? 
It should go without saying that recent events should not be a pretext for allowing the government to control political dissent, including extremist speech and legitimate hyperbole (a large and important category). But the new and unanswered question has to do with the constitutionality of restrictions on speech that expressly advocates illegal, murderous violence in messages to mass audiences. For most of American history, the courts held that no one has a right to advocate violations of the law."5 They ruled that advocacy of crime is wholly outside of the First Amendment-akin to a criminal attempt and punishable as such. 6 Indeed, many of the judges .revered as the strongest champions of free speech believed that express advocacy of crime was punishable. Judge Learned Hand, in his great 1917 opinion in Masses Publishing Co. v Patten3,7 established himself as a true hero of free speech when he said that even dangerous dissident speech was generally protected against government regulation. But Hand himself agreed that government could regulate any speaker who would "counsel or advise a man" to commit an unlawful act.3" 
In the same period the Supreme Court concluded that government could punish all speech, including advocacy of illegality, that had a "tendency" to produce illegality.39 Justices Holmes and Brandeis, the dissenters from this conclusion, took a different approach, saying that speech could be subjected to regulation only if it was likely to produce imminent harm;" thus they originated the famous "clear and present danger" test.4' But even Holmes and Brandeis suggested that the government could punish speakers who had the explicit intention of encouraging crime.42 
For many years thereafter, the Supreme Court tried to distinguish between speech that was meant as a contribution to democratic deliberation and speech that was designed to encourage illegality. 3 The former was protected; the latter was not. In 1951 the Court concluded in Dennis v United States" that a danger need not be so "clear and present" if the ultimate harm was very grave.45 The break in the doctrine did not come until the Court's 1969 decision in Brandenburg v Ohio." There the Court said the government could not take action against a member of the Ku Klux Klan, who said, among other things, "[W]e're not a revengent organization, but if our President, our Congress, our Supreme Court, continues to suppress the white, Caucasian race, it's possible that there might have to be some revengence taken."47 The speaker did not explicitly advocate illegal acts or illegal violence. But in its decision, the Court announced a broad principle, ruling that the right to free speech does "not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action."48 
Offering extraordinarily broad protection to political dissent, the Court required the government to meet three different criteria to regulate speech.49 First, the speaker must promote not just any lawless action but "imminent" lawless action.5 ยฐ Second, the imminent lawless action must be "likely" to occur.5 Third, the speaker must intend to produce imminent lawless action.52

52 Id (stating that the speech must be "directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action"). The Brandenburgtest borrows something from Hand and something from Holmes and produces a standard even more protective of speech than either of theirs. 
Applied straightforwardly, the Brandenburg test seems to protect most speech that can be heard on the airwaves or found on the Internet. It suggests that there is no need for casuistry and that a simple rule can resolve all cases. And in general, the Brandenburg test makes a great deal of sense. Remarks like those quoted from Rush Limbaugh unquestionably qualify for protection; such remarks are not likely to incite imminent lawless action, and in any case they are not "directed to" producing such action. They should also qualify as legitimate hyperbole, a category recognized in a 1969 decision allowing a war protester to say, "If they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L. B. J."53 Even Liddy's irresponsible statements might receive protection insofar as they could be viewed as unlikely to produce imminent illegality. A high degree of protection and breathing space makes a great deal of sense whenever the speech at issue is political protest, which lies at the core of the First Amendment. 
But there is some ambiguity in the Brandenburg test, especially in the context of modern technologies, and it is here that a high degree of judicial caution is appropriate. Suppose that an incendiary speech, expressly advocating illegal violence, is not likely to produce lawlessness in any particular listener or viewer. But suppose too that it is believed that of the millions of listeners, one or two, or ten, may well be provoked to act, and perhaps to imminent, illegal violence. Might the government ban advocacy of criminal violence in mass communications when it is reasonable to think that one person, or a few, will take action? Brandenburg offers a reasonable approach to the somewhat vague speech in question in that case, which was made in a setting where relatively few people were in earshot. But the case offers unclear guidance on the express advocacy of criminal violence via the airwaves or the Internet. 
When messages advocating murderous violence are sent to large numbers of people, it is possible to think that the Brandenburg calculus changes: Government may well have the authority to stop speakers from expressly advocating the illegal 5- Watts v United States, 394 US 705, 706 (1969). use of force, at least if it is designed to kill people. The calculus changes when the risk of harm increases because of the sheer number of people exposed. Hence the requirement of causation might be loosened, at least for explicit advocacy of murder. There is little democratic value in protecting simple counsels of murder, 4 and the ordinary Brandenburg requirements might be loosened where the risks are great. Consider, for example, the fact that Congress has made it a crime to threaten to assassinate the President, and the Court has cast no doubt on that restriction of speech.55 It would be a short step, not threatening legitimate public dissent, for the Federal Communications Commission to impose civil sanctions on those who expressly advocate illegal acts aimed at killing people. Courts might well conclude that the government may use its power over the airwaves to ensure that this sort of advocacy does not occur. 
Of course, there are serious problems in drawing the line between counsels of violence that should be subject to regulation and those that should not. We might begin (and perhaps we should end) with restrictions on express advocacy of unlawful killing; this is the clearest case. I am not trying to draw conclusions so much as I am trying to suggest reasons for courts to be cautious in invoking the Constitution. In any case, we can now see that existing doctrine does not justify a simple conclusion. It was built on different factual circumstances; it was designed for what was, with respect to communications, a quite different world. The degree of danger from counsels of murder has increased with the rise of the Internet. 
Authorizing the restriction of any speech, even counsels of violent crime, creates serious risks. It is unnecessary to emphasize that government often overreacts to short-term events, and the 1995 Oklahoma City tragedy, for example, should not be the occasion for an attack on extremist political dissent. Vigorous, even hateful, criticism of government is very much at the heart of the right to free speech. Certainly advocacy of law violation can ' The case might be different, however, if the counsel of violence is made part of an actual political argument. See Cohen v California,403 US 15 (1971) (holding that a state could not, consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, make wearing a jacket with the words "Fuck the Draft" a criminal offense). 
5' See Watts, 394 US at 707 (upholding the facial validity of a statute criminalizing threats of violence directed against the President because of the "overwhelmin[g] interest in protecting the safety of [the] Chief Executive and in allowing him to perform his duties without interference from threats of physical violence"). See also R.A. v St. Paul, 505 US 377 (1992) (stating "the Federal Government can criminalize only those threats of violence that are directed against the President"). be an appropriate part of democratic debate. As the example of Martin Luther King, Jr. testifies, there is an honorable tradition of civil disobedience. We should sharply distinguish, however, King's form of nonviolent civil disobedience from counsels or acts of murder. The principle condemning government regulation of political opinions, including the advocacy of illegal acts, need not be interpreted to bar the government from restricting advocacy of unlawful killing on the mass media. These are hard cases, and courts should be reluctant to conclude that the First Amendment forbids well-designed legislative initiatives. 
Does the government have the power to limit speech containing instructions on how to build weapons of mass destruction? The Brandenburg test was designed mostly to protect unpopular points of view from government controls; it need not protect the publication of bomb manuals, at least if these manuals are being transmitted to millions of people. Instructions for building bombs are not a point of view, and if government wants to stop the mass dissemination of this material, it should probably be allowed to do so. A lower court so ruled in a 1979 case involving an article in The Progressivethat described how to make a hydrogen bomb.56 The court's argument is even stronger as applied to the speech on the Internet, where so many people can be reached so easily.5 7 In such a case, the potential harm from the relevant materials is significantly increased. And bomb manuals, qua bomb manuals, do not deserve the highest degree of constitution56 See United States v Progressive,Inc., 467 F Supp 990 (WD Wis 1979), dismissed by 610 F2d 819 (7th Cir 1979) (unpublished order). 
17 It is worth observing here that the nation's leaders can do a good deal short of regulation. The President and other public officials should exercise their own rights of free speech to challenge hateful, incendiary speech. Although public officials could abuse these rights so as to chill legitimate protest, President Clinton's statements condemning hatred on the radio and on the Internet were entirely on the mark. Public disapproval may ultimately have a salutary effect (as it recently did in the case of violent television shows), even without the force of law. 
In addition, private institutions, such as broadcasting stations, should think carefully about their own civic responsibilities. An owner of a station or a programming manager is under no constitutional obligation to air speakers who encourage illegal violence. Stations that deny airtime for such views do no harm to the First Amendment but on the contrary exercise their own rights, and in just the right way. In recent months, public and private concern about hate-mongering has encouraged some stations to cancel G. Gordon Liddy's show; this is not a threat to free speech but an exercise of civic duties. Similarly, private online networks, such as Prodigy and America Online, have not only a right but a moral obligation to discourage speech that expressly counsels illegal killing. al protection. Regulation of instructions on how to commit terrorist acts does not place the government in a position where it does not belong.5" 
None of this suggests that the First Amendment has no role in cyberspace. I suggest that the Court should proceed confidently in three kinds of cases. The first involves those in which the government is discriminating on the basis of viewpoint. The prohibition on viewpoint discrimination is a natural inference from the First Amendment's ban on governmental favoritism. If the government regulates the Internet so as to preclude or prefer viewpoints of the government's liking, the First Amendment requires invalidation. 
The second category includes cases in which government is regulating political speech. The heart of the First Amendment lies in democratic self-governance,5 9 and when the government regulates political speech, there is special basis for suspicion. The only qualification is that courts should probably uphold viewpoint-neutral efforts to promote education and greater attention to public issues."0 
Finally, courts should strike down palpably vague or overbroad statutes."1 Nonpolitical speech may certainly be regu50 Progressive,467 F Supp at 990, however, involved a distinctive issue: an effort to show how easy it is to learn how to make a bomb. 
"9 See Alexander Meiklejohn, Free Speech and its Relation to Self-Government (Harper & Row, 1948); Cass R. Sunstein, Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech (Free Press, 1993). 
o See Cass R. Sunstein, The First Amendment in Cyberspace, 104 Yale L J 1757 (1995). 
", For key cases on the overbreadth doctrine, see Gooding v Wilson, 405 US 518, 519 (1972) (holding a Georgia statute to be on its face unconstitutionally vague and overbroad in providing that any person using to another "opprobrious words or abusive language, tending to cause a breach of the peace.., shall be guilty of a misdemeanor," when Georgia courts had held that the statute did not only apply to "fighting words"); Broadrick v Oklahoma, 413 US 601 (1973) (holding that an Oklahoma statute which prohibited any employee in the classified service from receiving or soliciting any assessment or contribution for any political organization or candidacy, did not set out sufficiently explicit standards, although it was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad on its face); City Council of the City of Los Angeles v Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 US 789 (1984) (holding that an ordinance prohibiting posting of signs on public property was not unconstitutional as applied to expressive activities of a group of supporters of a political candidate); Board of Airport Commissioners of the City of Los Angeles v Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 US 569 (1987) (holding that a regulation banning all 'First Amendment activities" within the airport's "Central Terminal Area" was facially unconstitutional under the overbreadth doctrine because no conceivable governmental interest could justify this absolute prohibition of lated in a constitutionally unacceptable manner. Statutes that produce guessing games for regulated parties create an unacceptable risk. Congress should be expected to regulate with at least a reasonable degree of clarity.62 Thus lower courts were correct to invalidate a vague and broad statute banning "indecent" speech on the Internet. 3 
When values and institutions are in flux, it is appropriate for the Court to proceed casuistically and to avoid broad rulings. The constitutional issues raised by cyberspace will turn on issues that cannot be fully resolved in 1995, 1996, or even 1999. In some ways, the First Amendment is, with respect to modern communications markets, playing the same pernicious role as did the Due Process Clause in the early part of the twentieth century with respect to labor markets. Hard issues of value and fact-issues of policy in which policy analysts should play a large role-are displaced by reference to constitutional categories, some of them quite arcane, and some of them likely to be ill-suited to a good understanding of the underlying phenomena. In a period of rapid change and technological uncertainty, in which those schooled in law are likely to be ignorant, there is much room for tentative, speech); Brockett v Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 US 491 (1985) (deferring to Court of Appeal's conclusion that a Washington statute which included "lust" within its definition of "prurient" was unconstitutionally overbroad, but reversing the decision on the ground that the lower court should have partially invalidated the statute as to the portion including "lust" rather than entirely invalidating it). But see New York v Ferber, 458 US 747 (1982) (holding that a child pornography statute which prohibited "lewd exhibition of the genitals" was not overbroad). 
For key cases on the vagueness doctrine, see Connally v General Construction Co., 269 US 385, 391 (1926) (holding that a law is facially void if it is vague enough that people "of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application"); Grayned v Rockford, 408 US 104 (1972) (stating that it is a basic principle that a law which fails to clearly define the conduct it proscribes is unconstitutional); Kolender v Lawson, 461 US 352, 361 (1983) (holding that an antiloitering statute requiring people to carry identification" and to account for their presence if questioned by a police officer was unconstitutionally vague because the.law reached "a substantial amount of [protected First Amendment] conduct"). 
6 An example of a law that could (and should) be held to be overbroad is the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Pub L No 104-104, 110 Stat 133 (1996), amending 47 USC ยง 223 (cited in note 16).

Hand My topics in this lecture are the myths that the Dred Scott case created, the myths that Americans have created about it, and the true lessons of the case for three of the great constitutional issues of the current era: affirmative action, homosexuality, and the right to die. 
THE CONTINUING RELEVANCE OF DRED SCOTT The Dred Scott case was probably the most important case in the history of the Supreme Court of the United States. Indeed, it was probably the most important constitutional case in the history of any nation and any court. But most of us have little if any sense of what it means or was even about. Even within the legal culture, the case is taught infrequently in constitutional law courses; outside of the legal culture, the case is pretty well forgotten, or at most a footnote in discussions of the Civil War. 
We should note right at the outset some of the many remarkable facts about the case. 
* Dred Scott was the first Supreme Court case * Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Jurisprudence, University ofChicago. since Marbury v. Madison invalidating a federal law. Since Marbury created judicial review in the context of a denial of jurisdiction, Dred Scott might plausibly be said to be the first real exercise of the power of judicial review. 
* Dred Scott was the first great effort by the Court to take an issue of political morality out of politics. In that sense, it is the great ancestor of many New Deal and Warren Court cases. 
* Dred Scott was the birthplace of the controversial idea of "substantive due process," used in Roe v. Wade, in many important cases endangering the regulatory/welfare state, and in the recent cases involving the "right to die." 
* Dred Scott was one of the first great cases unambiguously using the "intent of the framers" and in that sense it was the great precursor of the method of Justice Scalia and Judge Bork. 
THREE MYTHS Let me now identify the great myths involving Dred Scott. The first and perhaps most important one was created by the Dred Scott case itself: The myth is that the original Constitution protected, supported, and entrenched slavery. On this view, the Constitution was emphatically pro-slavery. As a legal matter, this is a myth in the simple sense that it is false: The Constitution does not support or entrench slavery.' But many people think the myth is true; in fact Justice Thurgood Marshall, in his remarks about the bicentennial, basically agreed with the Dred Scott Court. 
The second myth comes from the conventional American "reading" of Dred Scott. According to that reading, Chief Justice Taney was a morally obtuse person heading a morally obtuse Court that it took a Civil War to overturn. This is a different kind of myth. It is not exactly false. But it is hardly the full story; it leaves enormous gaps. An adequate understanding of Dred Scott lies elsewhere. It has a great deal to do with the appropriate role of the Supreme Court in American government. It has to do with how a democratic citizenry governs itself. 
1 Of course the Constitution did not abolish slavery. In fact it recognized the existence of the institution of slavery, but without endorsing or entrenching it. See below. 
The third myth is a revisionist reading of the case, coming from Justice Scalia and others critical of the Warren Court. Here is myth #3: Dred Scott was wrong because the Court abandoned the "intentions of the framers" in favor of its own conception of social policy. On this view, Dred Scott was wrong because it was politics rather than law, and it was politics rather than law because it abandoned the Constitution, understood as a historical document. This myth has more than a kernel of truth in it, for Dred Scott cannot be said to have been an accurate reading of the original understanding of the framers. But myth #3 qualifies as a myth because Dred Scott was very much and very self-consciously an "originalist" opinion, that is, it purported to draw nearly all of its support from the views of the framers: "It is not the province of the court to decide upon the justice or injustice, the policy or impolicy, of these laws. The decision of that question belonged to the political or law-making power; to those who formed the sovereignty and framed the Constitution. The duty of the court is, to.interpret the instrument they have framed, with the best lights we can obtain on the subject, and to administer it as we find it, according to its true intent and meaning when it was adopted."2 
To replace these myths, I suggest that the defect of Dred Scott lay largely in the Court's effort to resolve, once and for all time, an issue that was splitting the nation on political and moral grounds. More particularly, we should understand Dred Scott to suggest that in general and if it possibly can,' the Supreme Court should avoid political thickets. It should leave Great Questions to politics. This is because the Court may answer those questions incorrectly, and because it may well make things worse even if it answers correctly. 
What I will suggest is that the Court should-as the Dred Scott Court did not-proceed casuistically, and this in two different ways. First, it should generally decide cases rather than set down broad rules. Second, it should try to avoid issues of basic principle and instead attempt to reach incompletely theorized agreements on particular cases.' By this term I 2 60 US at 405. 
These two qualifications are important. See below. 
4 I describe these ideas in more detail in Cass R. Sunstein, Legal Reasoning and Political Conflict (1996). mean concrete judgments on which people can converge from diverse foundations. In this way the Court can both model and promote a crucial goal of a liberal political system: to make it possible for people to agree when agreement is necessary, and to make it unnecessary for people to agree when agreement is impossible. 
These claims have a set of implications for contemporary questions. I deal with three such questions here: affirmative action, the right to die, and homosexuality. My unifying theme is that the Court should generally adopt strategies that promote rather than undermine democratic reflect and debate. I suggest, first and in some ways foremost, that courts should not invalidate affirmative action. The court of appeals' recent decision in the University of Texas case was hubristic in the same sense as Dred Scottan effort, with insufficient constitutional warrant, to remove a big issue of principle from politics. The attack on affirmative action is a legitimate and in some ways salutary part of political debate; as a legal phenomenon it reflects a form of judicial hubris. At most, the Court should invalidate the most irrational and extreme affirmative action programs, and in that way attempt to promote and to inform democratic deliberation on the underlying issues. 
With the right to die, things are a bit different; here the problem is that the relevant laws are old and based on perhaps anachronistic assumptions, and hence the basic issue has not been subject to democratic debate. I suggest that the Court should proceed cautiously, incrementally, on a fact-specific basis. Instead of vindicating a broad "right to privacy," courts might say-if they are to play any role at all-that intrusions on individual liberty may not be based on old laws rooted in different circumstances and perhaps anachronistic values, and that any such intrusions must be supported by more recent acts of political deliberation. For the right to die, the best approach lies in a form of self-conscious dialogue between courts and legislatures. 
In some ways the question of discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation is the hardest-at least if one believes, as I do,' that such discrimination is generally unacceptable under constitutional princi 
I acknowledge that this is an unconventional view and I do not attempt to defend this belief here. ples as they are appropriately understood. I will suggest a form of incrementalism in support of a constitutional attack on discrimination against homosexuals. Even if courts believe that the attack is plausible on its merits, they should hesitate before entering this "political thicket." They should follow President Lincoln, not Chief Justice Taney. 
DRED SCOTT: DRAMATIS PERSONAE Every myth is filled with people, usually people of high drama. This is certainly true of the Dred Scott story. Let me tell you something about the people behind the Dred Scott case. 
Who was Dred Scott? We lack have full answers. It appears that he was born in about 1799-around the ratification of the Bill of Rights-and that he was quite short, about five feet tall. His real name may have been Sam. The only picture of Dred Scott, taken in 1856, shows him in his mid-fifties. After interviewing Scott in 1857, a St. Louis newspaper said that Scott was "illiterate but not ignorant" and that he had a strong common sense sharpened by his many travels. There is reason to believe that Scott provided initiative for his case. Immediately before the suit was filed, Scott tried to buy his freedom from his owner, Mrs. Emerson. She declined. The Dred Scott case followed. 
Since childhood Scott lived in Virginia with Peter Blow and his wife Elizabeth. The Blows moved from Virginia to Alabama and then, in 1830, left with seven children (including Taylor, whose name you should remember) and six slaves for St. Louis. This was not a good place for the family. Peter Blow's business venture, the Jefferson Hotel, did poorly; Elizabeth Blow died in 1831; Peter died a year later. 
After Peter Blow's death, one Dr. John Emerson bought one of his slaves, and in 1833 took that slave, Dred Scott, into service at Fort Armstrong, in Illinois. Illinois was a nonslave state, and this was important. Scott lived for an extended period in a state that outlawed slavery, raising a key question in his case: Was he thereby freed? This became a key question in the case. 
In 1838 Emerson took Scott for a second sojourn into Fort Snelling, near what is now known as St. Paul, Minnesota. Thus Scott, held as a slave in the free state of Illinois for more than two years, was living in a territory in which slavery was banned by the Missouri Compromise. There Scott met Harriet Robinson, a slave about twenty years old; Harriet was sold to Emerson and the two were married, a marriage that lasted until his death in 1858. Four children were born to them; the two sons died as infants, but two daughters (Eliza, born in 1838, and Lizzie, born in 1847) survived and became parties to the Dred Scott case. Scott stayed with Emerson until Emerson's death in 1943. 
John Sanford, Emerson's brother-in-law, was an executor of the will. Dred Scott was apparently in the service of Mrs. Emerson's brother in law, Captain Bainbridge, from 1643 to 1846. On April 6, 1846, Dred and Harriet Scott brought suit against Irene Emerson. They alleged assault and false imprisonment. Dred and Harriet complained that Emerson had beaten him and imprisoned him. And they claimed that there were free. 
(It is worth noting at this point that Dred Scott remained friends with the Blow family long after the death of Peter and Elizabeth. The Blows and their in-laws were principal supporters during the lawsuits between 1846 and 1857. And we should especially remember Taylor Blow, Dred Scott's benefactor after he was freed and indeed until the day of his death. Interestingly, Taylor Blow was not opposed to slavery in principle. He apparently acted from personal bonds extending back to his childhood.) 
These, then, are the people behind the case: Dred, Harriet, Eliza and Lizzie Scott, the plaintiffs; Peter and Blow, original owners; Taylor Blow; Irene Emerson and her brother-in-law, John Sanford. (It should be obvious at this point that a mystery in the Dred Scott case is its title: Why was the case styled Dred Scott v. Sanford? It could as easily have been called Harriet Scott v. Emerson. But as a woman, Harriet Scott was not supposed to be the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit, and the defendant was the executor of the estate rather than the real owner of Scott. But there should be no mistaking the fact that the legal interests of Emerson and Scott were emphatically at stake.) DRED SCOTT: THE LAW Now let us turn to the legal issues in the case. Scott noted that the state constitution of Illinois abolished slavery and that the Missouri Compromise banned slavery in the Louisiana territory. Hence Scott claimed that he was made a free man by virtue of his sustained stays in those places. Sanford responded that Scott was not free, because his former owner had a continuing property interest in him-that is what slavery meant-and because the federal government could not deprive an owner of property without due process of law. In any case, Sanford claimed that Scott could not sue in federal court, since Scott was not a citizen of Missouri, or indeed of any state. 
The largest question in the case was whether Dred Scott was still a slave. That case in turn raised three principal issues. 
First: Could Scott sue in federal court? If he was a citizen of Missouri, suing a citizen of New York, he could indeed sue under the diversity of citizenship provision of the federal Constitution, which gives federal courts jurisdiction over disputes between people domiciled in different states; otherwise not. 
Second: Was the Missouri Compromise constitutional? 
Third: What was the effect on Scott's status in Missouri of the transportation of Scott into nonslave states? 
The Supreme Court decided the case in 1857, a year in which the United States was profoundly split because of the issue of slavery. There can be no doubt that the Court attempted to take that issue "out of politics"-a point to which I will return. WAs DRED ScoTT A CITIZEN? Justice Taney's opinion held first that Scott was not a citizen of Missouri. Therefore the federal courts had no jurisdiction over the case. 
This was a complex issue. There is no definition of the term "citizen" for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Perhaps we should say that whether Scott is a citizen of Missouri depends on Missouri law. Perhaps the question whether Scott is a citizen of Missouri depends on whether Scott was still a slave. No one argued that slaves qualified as citizens. 
But Justice Taney went very much further than this. He did not rely on Missouri law. Instead he argued very broadly that no person descended from an American slave could ever be a citizen for constitutional purposes. Under the constitution, "they are not included . . . under the word citizen and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges of citizens. . . " It is here that Taney could not rely on constitutional text, which was ambiguous, but resorted explicitly and self-consciously to an understanding of original intentions. Thus he wrote: "On the contrary, [descendants of Africans] were at that time considered as a subordinate and inferior class of beings, who had been subjugated by the dominant race, and whether emancipated or not, yet remained subject to their authority, and had no rights or privileges but such as those who held the power and the Government might choose to grant them." 
As I have said, this was one of the first self-consciously "originalist" opinions from the Supreme Court. On this issue, the Court spoke for its understanding of what the framers believed. (We cannot indict a method on the ground that it has been misapplied. All I mean to suggest is that it is worth noting that the Court was attempting to speak for history and couched its decision explicitly in historical terms.) WAS THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE CONSTITUTIONAL? At first glance, the Court's jurisdictional conclusion should have been the end of the matter. If Scott was not a citizen of Missouri, the federal courts had no authority to hear Scott's complaint, and the case should have been at an end, at least for Chief Justice Taney. 
But the Court went on to consider the huge question whether Scott remained a slave after living in Illinois and the Louisiana Territory. The Court said that he did. But why? This question is much harder to answer. 
Perhaps Missouri law governed the question whether Scott, a resident there, was still a slave. Four justices so concluded. This idea is not implausible, and for those justices, there was no reason to speak to the constitutional validity of the Missouri Compromise. But three of them did so anyhow. Thus a total of six justices concluded that Scott was still a slave because the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional. Why was this so? 
First, he said that Congress' authority to "make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States" did not extend to territories 1789 perhaps it did not seem plausible even to Chief Justice Taney, so he offered a second point. Thus he said that slavery was constitutionally sacrosanct, so that even if Congress had authority over new territories, it could not ban slavery there. "[T]he right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution." But this too was an adventurous conclusion. Thus Justice Taney added a third point, to the effect that Congress' power over the territories could not collide with other constitutional limitations. Congress could not, for example, eliminate freedom of speech in the territories. And this point was decisive for the question at hand. A law that deprives someone of property because he has brought it into a particular place "could hardly be dignified with the name of due process of law." 
This was an exceptionally important moment in American law. It was the birthplace of the idea of "substantive due process," the idea used in the Lochner era cases, in Roe v. Wade, and in many of the most controversial decisions in the Court's history. 
Why was this a new idea? On its face, the due process clause appears to give people a right to a hearing to contest factual findings, and Sanford sought much more than that. Does the due process clause give courts authority to strike down legislation as unreasonable or as substantively unjust? Before Dred Scott, the Supreme Court had not suggested that it did. The suggestion was textually awkward, to say the least. The due process clause seems to speak of procedure, not of substance. 
Even if the due process clause is understood to have a substantive dimension, there is a big problem with the Court's argument. International law had long held that a master who voluntarily takes a slave into free territory therefore relinquishes his property interest in the slave. So long as the territory is known to be a free one, this is not a "taking" of property. If California says that people may not own lions, and if a citizen from Arizona takes a lion into California, there is no constitutional problem if the lion is removed and even freed. Even on Justice Taney's assumptions, his argument was remarkably brisk and unconvincing. I return to this point below. 
It might appear to you at this point that the Court had a narrow route to resolution of the case. Perhaps a free slave could be deemed a citizen for purposes of jurisdiction. And perhaps the Court need not have assessed the constitutionality of the Missouri Compromise. Perhaps the crucial issue in the case was whether Missouri had to recognize any change in Scott's status from his visit into free areas. If Missouri did not have to recognize that change, the case was over. And if Scott's stay in Illinois produced a change in status that Missouri had to respect, the case was over as well. 
In fact the justices initially concluded that they would not decide the largest issues in the case and that they would conclude very simply that under Missouri law, Scott was still a slave. If that was so, the case could be resolved simply and without broad pronouncements. But shortly after his election, President Buchanan wrote to one of the justices with the suggestion that it was important "to destroy the dangerous slavery agitation and thus restore peace to our distracted country." A variety of factors moved Justice Wayne to insist that the Court should deal with the two key issues-the status of the Missouri compromise and the status of freed blacks as citizens-on which the justices originally decided to remain silent. Five justices eventually agreed; all were from slave states. 
Justice Wayne later told a Southern Senator that he had "gained a triumph for the Southern section of the country, by persuading the chief justice that the court could put an end to all further agitation on the subject of slavery in the territories." Here is the obvious punch line: For palpable political reasons, the Court was persuaded to speak to all of the key questions. Its obvious goal was to solve, once and for all time, the great moral and political crisis that slavery had created for the United States of America. Now we are in a position to explore the question: What was wrong with the Dred Scott opinion? Let us divide potential answers into two categories: institutional and substantive. The substantive answers have to do with the best reading of the Constitution. The institutional answers have to do with the appropriate role of the Supreme Court in American government. The two are related, but it is both useful and important to try to separate them. 
Begin with issues of substance. The Court was not just reckless but simply wrong to say what it did with respect to the status of freed slaves. There was no basis for the Court's conclusion that freed slaves could not count as citizens. In fact some freed slaves participated in the ratification of the Constitution itself; and freed slaves were allowed to vote in at least five of the colonies. The Constitution does not suggest that free citizens do not stand on the same ground as everybody else. 
In fact the text of the Constitution-its infamous three-fifths clause-itself undermines the Court's conclusion. If slaves count for three-fifths of a human being for perhaps of apportioning representatives (a provision recognizes without endorsing slavery, and that itself creates an incentive to eliminate slavery), then freed slaves count as 100% human beings for those purposes. Hence the Constitution expressly distinguishes not between African and non-African descendants, but between slaves and free persons, whether African or not. This part of the constitutional text was not mentioned in Dred Scott, but it argues strongly the other way. 
More generally, the Constitution does nothing to entrench slavery. It recognizes the existence of the institution but does little more than that.6 Certainly some of the Constitution's framers believed that slavery was acceptable or desirable (though consider slaveholder Jefferson's suggestion that "I tremble for my country" when contemplat6 More particularly, there are three relevant provisions. (1) Article I section 9 prevents Congress from prohibiting the slave trade until 1808. This is hardly an endorsement of slavery. It gives slave states a relatively short period in which to import slaves, and then lets Congress do as it wishes. (2) Article IV section 3 requires nonslave states to return fugitive slaves to their owners. This provision is extremely limited; it does not say anything about the obligations of states to respect slave-owners who voluntarily come, with their slaves, into nonslave states. (3) The so-called three-fifths clause, Article 1, section 2, says that representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned by adding to the whole number of free persons "three fifths of all other persons." This provision is designed for purposes of allocating representatives and direct taxes. As not, it creates an incentive to free slaves, by giving slave states more political power if they become nonslave states. It certainly does not reflect any judgments that slaves are just 2/3 of "people." ing that God is just). Maybe a majority of them thought so. But they did not put that judgment in the Constitution itself. There was no reason to think that freed slaves should not qualify as citizens for constitutional purposes. 
The Court's decision with respect to the Missouri Compromise was also both reckless and wrong. On its face, congressional power over the territories is extremely broad. It is absurd to say that that power was limited to existing territories. To be sure, that power cannot be used to violate the Constitution itself; Congress could not outlaw political dissent within the territories. On this score the Dred Scott Court was correct. But contrary to the Court's suggestion, the Constitution does not distinctly and expressly affirm the property rights of slaveowners. It recognizes, somewhat obliquely, the institution of slavery. But it did not endorse that institution. Indeed it forbids Congress from outlawing the slave trade before 1808, a provision that is hardly a ringing endorsement of the institution of slavery. And as I have said, the use of substantive due process-even if there is such thing-was unsupportable because there is no "taking" of property when one state gives people notice that certain goods (guns, bombs) are not allowed there. 
So much for constitutional substance. I think the institutional issues are more important, more subtle, and of more enduring relevance. There are two points here. 
First: The Court reached out to answer numerous questions not requiring a judicial answer in the case at hand. Once it found that Scott was not a citizen, the case was at an end. The Court lacked jurisdiction. Or it could have said very modestly, and without pronouncing on the Missouri Compromise or the citizenship question, that Missouri law controlled Scott's status as a citizen in Missouri. There are good reasons for the old idea that courts should decide only those issues necessary to the resolution of the case at hand. This idea minimizes the role of judges in the constitutional regime and allows room for democratic deliberation and debate. Amazingly, the Dred Scott Court took the opposite approach; it decided every issue raised by the case, regardless of whether the decision was necessary to settle Scott's complaint. 
Second and foremost: The nation was in the midst of an extraordinary deep and wide debate about one of the central moral issues of the time. It is ludicrous to suppose that nine lawyers in Washington could lay this issue to rest by appeal to the Constitution. It is hubristic for nine lawyers charged with interpreting the Constitution to think that they know the right answer for the nation as a whole. In such cases the likelihood of error is very high, and the likelihood of success-a final resolution for a heterogeneous nation-is low even if there is no error. The Court should have proceeded with greatest caution unless it found the Constitution unambiguous on the point or unless it thought the moral principle so urgent and so plausibly constitutional in character as to require judicial endorsement. Neither of these could be said in Dred Scott. The Court should have decided the case narrowly by asking about the status of Missouri law. 
LINCOLN AND JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS I want to say a word now about the nation's reaction to Dred Scott, and about the appropriate attitude of citizens and public officials to Supreme Court decisions. My basic point is this: The Supreme Court has the last word on cases that it decides. But interpretation of the Constitution is emphatically not only a judicial activity. Constitutional interpretation is for others as well. The Supreme Court is supreme but only in a limited way. It does not preclude constitutional complaints by others seeking change. Certainly this is so when issues of constitutional law are also issues of basic political principle. In such cases it is especially important to insist-as have Presidents Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Reagan, among others-that the Supreme Court has no monopoly on constitutional interpretation. 
Consider in this regard Abraham Lincoln's words: "if this important decision had been made by the unanimous concurrence of the judges, and without any apparent partisan bias and in accordance with legal public expectation, and with the steady practice of the departments throughout out history, and had been in no part, based on assumed historical facts, which are not really true or, if wanting in some of these, had been affirmed and reaffirmed, it might be factious, even revolutionary, to not acquiesce in it. But when we find it wanting in all these claims to public confidence, it is not resistance, it is not factious, it is not even disrespectful, to treat it as not having yet quite established a settled doctrine for the country." And in 1858 Lincoln said: "If I were in Congress and a vote should come up on a question whether slavery should be prohibited in a new territory, in spite of that Dred Scott decision, I would vote that it should." 
Lincoln's simplest and most dramatic statement on the topic echoed the theme of democratic deliberation and a shared role in constitutional interpretation: "The candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people, is to irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned the government into the hands of that eminent tribunal." 
In this light we might see the Court as having a dialogic relation with others engaged in political and moral deliberation, and others thinking about the meaning of the Constitution. The Dred Scott Court fostered no such dialogue. In fact its whole goal was preclusive. But it is predictable in such circumstances that the Court will fail and that voices will be loudly raised against it. This is certainly so for the most invasive decisions in the Court's history-Dred Scott, Lochner v. New York, Roe v. Wade, Buckley v. Valeo. What the Court ought to do, generally and to the extent that it can, is act as a participant in democratic deliberation, not as the unique "forum of principle" in American government. 
It will not have escaped notice that this is an argument for a degree of judicial statesmanship.' It is an argument that there is no mechanism to determine the Constitution's meaning; that meaning is a function of judgment; and that judgment, rightly exercised, involves both substantive issues and institutional constraints. 
LESSONS DRAWN AND APPLIED: AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, HOMOSEXUALITY, THE RIGHT TO DIE 
It is emphatically not an argument for Bork-style "originalism." See Sunstein, Legal Reasoning and PoliticalConflict (1996). resolve issues of high principle that are fundamentally for the public, not for the judiciary. I mean, then, to approve of judicial casuistry. Let us take Dred Scott to suggest the following points. First, courts should generally not set forth broad theories of the good or the right; they should try to bracket those issues and leave them for other places. Second, they should, to the extent possible and in general, decide cases by reference to modest, low-level rationales on which diverse people can agree. 
We might say that in constitutional cases, courts should adopt incompletely theorized agreements, and in that way to economize on moral disagreement. This is perfectly familiar in ordinary lifefamilies, workplaces, and much more. We can imagine many settings in which people who disagree on large abstractions can agree on particular cases. Certainly this is often true for a faculty; it is true too for a polity. In doing this, courts can lower the costs of decision and also the costs of error. And they can accomplish one of the most important goals of a well-functioning deliberative democracy, to promote necessary agreement while minimizing the problems created by fundamental disagreement. 
Judicial casuistry has another feature. When they are in the midst of a political thicket, courts should not decide more cases than have been placed before them. That is, they should, generally and to the extent possible, decide cases with close reference to the particular issues presented. This strategy decreases the cost of decision, and decreased costs are a significant gain. This strategy also allows large scope for democratic self-governance. It does this because it can trigger public debate, and signal the existence of issues of high principle, without at the same time foreclosing fresh thinking or disallowing the democratic public from resolving the foundational issues as it chooses. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION Now let us try to apply these thoughts to some contemporary issues. The nation is in the midst of a large debate over color-conscious programs, and many people have vigorously urged the Supreme Court to foreclose such programs, whether deemed "affirmative action" or something else. And there are passages in Supreme Court decisions that read roughly like this: "In the Civil War, the nation decided on a principle of color-blindness. Whether this is a desirable or wise principle is not for us to say. But the issue has been foreclosed by our heritage." 
Or it might be said, as a court of appeals recently did, that equal protection clause has come to be understood to embody a principle of race neutrality that is violated by all affirmative action programs, including those in the educational system. Thus in its remarkable decision striking down an affirmative action plan for the University of Texas Law School, the court of appeals said that race-consciousness was acceptable only to remedy identified acts of past discrimination. Thus public universities must proceed on a race-neutral basis. (Through Title VI, this view may extend to private universities as well.) 
In this form, a court opinion outlawing affirmative action is closely analogous to Dred Scott, and defective-abusive, overreaching-for the same reason. It would be an amazing act of hubris. In one form, a supposed past historical judgment, itself not clearly embodied in the constitutional text,' is used to foreclose democratic experimentation. (Recall Dred Scott on citizenship and the Missouri Compromise.) In another form, a general principle ("color-blindness") is announced to foreclose such experimentation even though the principle covers a wide range of situations, some of which seem to draw the principle in some doubt (as where race is a minor factor used alongside many other minor factors). We might compare the narrower, fact-intensive, casuistical approaches characteristic of Justice Powell in the Bakke case and on occasion Justice O'Connor. 
My simple proposition is this: There are many kinds of affirmative action programs. The nation has embarked on a large-scale debate about such programs. That debate raises issues of both morality and fact. Ultimately the place of affirmative action programs should be decided democratically, not judicially. 
8 There is no evidence that the equal protection clause was intended to stop affirmative action, and considerable evidence to the contrary. In fact those who ratified the fourteenth amendment engaged in race-conscious remedial programs. It would be most refreshing if some of the originalist justices on the Court, who tend to oppose affirmative action on constitutional grounds, would invoke some historical support for their views (it is hard to find any), or would say that although they personally do not like affirmative action, the history forbids them from invalidating it on constitutional grounds. I am indebted to David Strauss for this thought. There is no sufficiently clear constitutional commitment to color blindness to justify judicial intrusion. 
Of course this is not to say that affirmative action programs are always good. Some of them are very bad. In any case they are extraordinarily diverse. Their validity depends on the details. And in these circumstances, courts should be attentive to the details. They should proceed modestly and casuistically. 
We are now in a position to discuss the possible catalytic role of the Supreme Court insofar as that role bears on the affirmative action debate. Suppose that it is agreed that the issue of affirmative action should be decided democratically rather than judicially-but suppose too that institutions are operating in such a way as to ensure that many public decisions are taken in an unaccountable way and are not really a product of democratic judgments. This is a plausible description of affirmative action programs between the period, say, 1975 and 1990. A meandering, casuistical, rule-free path may well be a salutary way of signaling the existence of large questions of policy and principle, at least with constitutional dimensions, when those questions would otherwise receive far less attention than they deserve. Hence the participants in Supreme Court cases have become familiar "characters" in the national debate, helping to frame discussion: Bakke, Weber, Johnson, minority construction contractors, and others. 
In fact the Court has mostly acted in this way. Some of the justices have undoubtedly been aware of the difficulty and variousness of the affirmative action problem and have chosen a casuistical approach for this reason. The Court's decisions have been among the factors that have kept affirmative action in the public eye and helped focus the public on issues of principle and policy. This is the best that can be said for the Court's rule-free path. When it confronts the admissions policy of the University of Texas, the Court should continue in this way, looking closely at the details, and avoiding broad pronouncements. But what I want to emphasize here is that it would be a democratic disaster if the Court, Dred Scott-style, were to foreclose further democratic debate in the name of the "color-blindness" principle. 
THE RIGHT TO DIE We are in the midst of a constitutional attack on laws that forbid state-assisted suicide. The right-todie debate is along one dimension significantly different from the debate over affirmative action. Here the relevant laws have been on the books for a long time, and they have not, as a general rule, been revisited by recently elected officials. 
Do such laws invade a constitutional "right to privacy"? Many people and some courts think so. Invoking the authority of Roe v. Wade, such people say that the government cannot legitimately interfere with self-regarding choices about what to do "with their bodies," and that therefore the choice is for the individual, not for the state. Several courts have recently gone in this direction. 
Thus stated, the argument for a constitutional right to die raises many questions and many doubts. Substantive due process does not deserve wide acceptance. For reasons I have suggested, it is textually awkward, to say the least. Moreover, the conditions in which a right to die might be asserted are widely variable. Perhaps some people choosing death would be confused or myopic. Perhaps some doctors would overbear their patients; perhaps some families could not entirely be trusted. In view of the complexity of the underlying issues of value and factour now-familiar theme-courts should be extremely reluctant to try to resolve this issue through judicial declaration. They lack the fact-finding expertise and policymaking competence. Thus recent court decisions announcing a large-scale "right to die" are another version of the Hopwood case; they are modest reruns of Dred Scott itself. 
Does this mean that courts should say nothing at all? Perhaps. But there is an alternative, and it bears on the principal difference between the affirmative action controversy and the controversy over the right to die. I think the most promising and ingenious solution, set out by Judge Guido Calebresi, attempts to promote a kind of dialogue between courts and the public. Let us notice first that the relevant laws were enacted long ago. They were designed to prevent people from being accessory to suicide; that was their fundamental purpose. Suicide was considered a genuine crime. But this reason for the statutes no longer holds much weight. Enforcement of those laws has fallen into neardesuetude. In any case these are not really cases of suicide, and the technology has much changed, making possible forms of euthanasia that would have been unimaginable when the laws were first enacted. 
The central point, for those interested in democratic deliberation, is that there has been no recent legislative engagement with the underlying moral and technological issues. In these circumstances, it is appropriate for a court to say that the state has not demonstrated an adequate reason to interfere with a private choice of this kind-unless and until a recent legislature is able to show that there is a sufficiently recent commitment to this effect to support fresh legislation. 
Understood in this way, the right to die cases are reminiscent of the Connecticut contraceptives case, Griswold v. Connecticut, as I would understand that case in the light of Dred Scott. In Griswold the Court embarked on the basis of taking large-scale positions on matters of political morality by speaking of a nonexistent constitutional "right of privacy." Instead the Court might have taken a very narrow approach in Griswold. It might have said that laws that lack real enforcement, that appear no longer to reflect considered political convictions, cannot be used against private citizens in decisions of this kind on what is predictably and almost inevitably a random basis. 
The underlying, time-honored principle-that involving desuetude-has strong democratic foundations. The principle condemning desuetude says that when an old law is practically unenforced because it does not receive sufficient public approval, ordinary citizens are permitted to violate it, and in that way to call democratic attention to the space between the law as popularly conceived and approved and the law as it exists on the books. 
An idea of this sort, I suggest, would be a singularly good way of beginning the constitutional debate about the right to die. It would not involve judicial prohibition. It would begin the debate by putting the burden of deliberation on representative bodies accountable to the people. 
HOMOSEXUALITY Now turn to claims that the Constitution forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Here plaintiffs' lawyers are invoking a principle of human equality to invalidate democratic outcomes. Here some people insist that a properly capacious notion of constitutional equality adequately justifies an aggressive judicial role. 
I will assert, without defending the point here, that that notion of equality does seem to me to connect very well with the equality principle that underlies the Civil War Amendments. Let us simply assume that this claim is right. We might even assume, at least for purposes of argument, that the rightness of the constitutional claim is very clear, and that the homosexual case is therefore different from cases involving affirmative action and the right to die, which seem in any case difficult. And thenhaving made things especially hard for ourselveslet us ask about the Court's appropriate role, returning to Abraham Lincoln in the process. 
Abraham Lincoln always insisted that slavery was wrong. On the basic principle, Lincoln allowed no compromises. No justification was available for chattel slavery. But on the question of means, Lincoln was quite equivocal-flexible, strategic, open to compromise, aware of doubt. The fact that slavery was wrong did not mean that it had to be eliminated immediately, or that blacks and whites had to be placed immediately on a plane of equality. On Lincoln's view, the feeling of "the great mass of white people" would not permit this result. In his most striking formulation: "Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound argument, is not the sole question, if indeed, it is any part of it. A universal feeling, whether well or ill-founded, can not be safely disregarded." What is most striking about this claim is the view that the inconsistency of a "feeling" with justice or sound argument may be irrelevant to the question of what to do at any particular point in time. 
On Lincoln's view, efforts to create immediate social change in this especially sensitive area could have disastrous unintended consequences or backfire, even if those efforts were founded on entirely sound principle. It was necessary first to educate people about the reasons for the change. Important interests had to be accommodated or persuaded to come on board. Issues of timing were crucial. Critics had to be heard and respected. For Lincoln, rigidity about the principle would always be combined with caution about the means by which the just outcome would be brought about. For this reason it is a mistake to see Lincoln's caution with respect to abolition as indicating uncertainty about the underlying principle. But it is equally mistaken to think that Lincoln's certainty about the principle entailed immediate implementation of racial equality. 
The point is highly relevant to constitutional law, especially in the area of social reform. Return to my basic theme: As it operates in the courts, constitutional law is a peculiar mixture of substantive theory and institutional constraint. Suppose, for example, that the ban on same-sex marriage is challenged on equal protection grounds. Even if judges find the challenge plausible in its substance, there is much reason for caution on the part of the courts. An immediate judicial vindication of the principle could well jeopardize important interests. It could galvanize opposition. It could weaken the antidiscrimination movement itself as that movement is operating in democratic arenas. (Compare Roe v. Wade.) It could provoke more hostility and even violence against homosexuals. It would certainly jeopardize the authority of the judiciary. 
Is it too pragmatic and strategic, too obtusely unprincipled, to suggest that judges should take account of these considerations? I do not believe so. Prudence is not the only virtue; it is certainly not the master virtue; but it is a virtue nonetheless. At a minimum, it seems plausible to suggest that courts should generally use their discretion over their docket in order to limit the timing of relevant intrusions into the political process. It also seems plausible to suggest that courts should be reluctant to vindicate even good principles when the vindication would compromise other interests, at least if those interests include, ultimately, the principles themselves. 
In the area of homosexuality, we might make some distinctions. If the Supreme Court of the United States accepted the view that states must authorize same-sex marriages in 1996, or even 1998, we should expect a constitutional crisis, a weakening of the legitimacy of the Court, an intensifying of hatred of homosexuals, a constitutional amendment overturning the Court's decision, and much more. Any Court should hesitate in the face of such prospects. It would be far better for the Court to do nothing-or better yet, to start cautiously and to proceed incrementally. 
The Court might, for example, conclude that the equal protection clause forbids state constitutional amendments that forbid ordinary democratic processes to outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Court might say that such amendments, of the sort that has been enacted (and invalidated judicially) in Colorado, do not merely discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, but also disfavor a defined group in the political process, in a way that involves issues of both animus and political equality. A judicial ruling of this kind would be quite narrow. In fact the Court proceeded very much in this way in its laudable decision in Romer v. Evans. 
Or the Court might say-as some lower courts have done-that government cannot rationally discriminate against people of homosexual orientation, without showing that those people have engaged in acts that harm any legitimate government interest. Narrow rulings of this sort would allow room for public discussion and debate, before obtaining a centralized national ruling that preempts ordinary political process. 
Armed with an understanding of Dred Scott, we can go much further. Constitutional law is not only for the courts; it is for all public officials. The original understanding was that deliberation about the Constitution's meaning would be part of the function of the President and legislators as well. The post-Warren Court identification of the Constitution with the decisions of the Supreme Court has badly disserved the traditional American commitment to deliberative democracy. In that system, all officials-not only the judges-have a duty of fidelity to the founding document. And in that system, we should expect that elected officials will have a degree of interpretive independence from the judiciary. We should even expect that they will sometimes fill the institutional gap created by the courts' lack of fact-finding ability and policymaking competence. For this reason, they may conclude that practices are unconstitutional even if the Court would uphold them, or that practices are valid even if the Court would invalidate them. Lincoln is an important example here as well. Often he invoked constitutional principles to challenge chattel slavery, even though the Supreme Court had rejected that reading of the Constitution in the Dred Scott case. It is time to conclude. The Dred Scott opinion was an abomination, and it was an abomination in two different ways. The first has to do with substantive law: Freed slaves should have qualified as citizens. The Missouri Compromise was a legitimate exercise of legislative authority. The serious question in the case was whether Missouri's view about Scott's status was binding. That was a little question, not a big one, and the Court should have stayed with the little question. 
But Dred Scott was also an abomination in ways that have to do with institutional role. The Court did not merely decide Dred Scott's case; it managed at once to assert that it lacked jurisdiction and to strike down an act of Congress not directly bearing on the jurisdictional issue-an especially neat trick. The Court purported to make the original intentions of the framers binding, even though those intentions were murky, did not compel the Court's conclusion, and were not in the Constitution itself. Perhaps worst of all, the Court deliberately reached out to decide nationally crucial issues that deserved and would ultimately receive an answer from the people rather than the judiciary. 
Thus understood, Dred Scott offers many lessons for those interested in the modem Supreme Court. As a general presumption, it argues against efforts to take the great moral issues out of politics. It argues in favor of an approach that sees constitutional interpretation and moral deliberation as tasks for representatives and citizens generally, not just for judges. It suggests that the great issues of political morality-affirmative action, the right to die, homosexual rights-are mostly for political processes, not for courts. 
This does not suggest that courts should do nothing. I have argued that in all three areas, courts can perform a catalytic role. Democratic deliberation is not a mere matter of counting noses. The Court can do a great deal of good in promoting more rather than less in the way of both democracy and deliberation. It can do a great deal of bad in producing less rather than more of these things. 
This, I suggest, is not a myth. It is the enduring lesson of Dred Scott. At least it is the enduring lesson for a Court that has an accommodating spirit, and that is not too sure that it is right. I have a coda. It consists of notes about what happened to the people in the case. 
John Sanford was insane and institutionalized by the time the decision was announced. He died on May 5, 1857. 
Despite the Court's decision, Dred Scott eventually won his freedom, because after the Court rendered its decision Calvin Chaffee, Irene Emerson's new husband, and his new wife took immediate measures to free Dred Scott. Scott lived as a free man-working as a hotel porter-for just a year before his death from tuberculosis in 1858.

and Professor Ronald F. Wright from the Wake Forest University 
In this lecture I discuss two phenomena of special importance for law. The first involves agreement on an abstraction,unaccompanied by agreement on what the abstraction specifically entails. The second involves agreement on a judgment in a concrete case, unaccompanied by agreement about what sorts of considerations ultimately account for the judgment. These agreements are incompletely theorized, though in differ* Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Jurisprudence, University of Chicago. This essay is the written version of the 1995 Oliver Wendell Holmes Lecture, delivered at Wake Forest University on October 27, 1995. For this lecture I have drawn on Cass R. Sunstein, LEGAL REASONING AND POLrICAL CONFLICT (forthcoming Mar. 1996); Incompletely Theorized Agreements, 108 HARv. L. REv. 1733 (1995); Problems with Rules, 83 CAL. L. REv. 953 (1995). ent ways. They are a clue to many features of a well-functioning legal culture, including the system of constitutionalism and the process of decision by reference to precedent. They also bear on democratic politics and practical reason in many arenas of social life. I connect these points with current debates over affirmative action and freedom of speech. 
L GENERAL PROPOSITIONS 
Incompletely theorized agreements play a pervasive role in law and society. It is quite rare for a person or group completely to theorize any subject, that is, to accept both a general theory and a series of steps connecting that theory to concrete conclusions. Thus we often have, in law, an incompletely theorized agreement on a general proposition-incompletely theorized in the sense that people who accept the principle need not agree on what it entails in particular cases. 
This is the sense emphasized by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in his great aphorism, "General principles do not decide concrete cases." 1 We accept the free speech principle, but disagree about pornography and commercial advertising. We know that murder is wrong, but disagree about whether abortion is wrong. We favor racial equality, but are divided on affirmative action. We believe in liberty, but disagree about increases in the minimum wage. Hence the pervasive legal and political phenomenon of an agreement on a general principle alongside disagreement about particular cases. The agreement is incompletely theorized in the sense that it is incompletely specified. Much of the key work must be done by others, often through casuistical judgments at the point of application. 
Often constitution-making becomes possible through this form of incompletely theorized agreement. Many constitutions contain incompletely specified standards and avoid sharp-edged rules, at least when it comes to the description of basic rights. Consider the cases of Eastern Europe and South Africa, where constitutional provisions include many abstract provisions on whose concrete specification there has been sharp dispute. Abstract provisions protect "freedom of speech," "religious liberty," and "equality under the law," and citizens agree on those abstractions in the midst of sharp dispute about what these provisions really entail. Thus, in South Africa various parties have agreed on a statement of abstract principles that will receive greater specification in the future. The South African Constitution is an interim one setting the framework for a final document. And in South Africa, as elsewhere, the content of the free speech principle is unclear despite the existence of that principle; so too with the range of policies that go under the rubric "affirmative action." The many abstractions found in Eastern European constitutions coexist with sharp disagreements on particular issues. 
Incompletely specified agreements thus have important social uses. Many of their advantages are practical. They allow people to develop frameworks for decision and judgment despite large-scale disagreements. At the same time, they help produce a degree of a social solidarity and shared commitment. People who are able to agree on political abstractions-freedom of speech, equal protection of the laws, freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures-can also agree that they are embarking on shared projects. These forms of agreement can help constitute a democratic culture. It is for the same reason that they are so important to constitution-making. 
Incompletely specified agreements also have the advantage of allowing people to show one another a high degree of mutual respect. By refusing to settle concrete cases that raise fundamental issues of conscience, they permit citizens to announce to one another that society shall not take sides on such issues until it is required to do so. Of course, there may be contexts in which more in the way of specification is a good idea. Sometimes it is important to move in the direction of rules. 2 I am not denying this, nor am I urging that incomplete specification is always desirable. I am urging only that it has important social uses, especially at the initial stages of lawmaking. 
B. 
I have referred to Holmes' suggestion that "General propositions do not decide concrete cases."' I believe that this is the greatest of Holmes' many great aphorisms. But like most aphorisms, it needs a good deal of unpacking. Much of law seems to consist of general propositions. How can law fail to decide concrete cases? What, most simply, does the statement mean? 
I think that Holmes' central point is that general propositions are incompletely specified. It is for this reason that they do not resolve particular cases, which turn on the specification. The Equal Protection Clause is an obvious example. To know whether a law denies someone "the equal protection of the laws," a great deal of supplemental detail is necessary. The Equal Protection Clause does not say whether a law discriminating on the basis of disability is violative of the equality norm. It does not say whether sex discrimination is acceptable. It does not tell us whether affirmative action is or is not constitutionally permissible. 
This point applies to many general propositions whose meaning depends on abstract terms conspicuously capable of many different meanings. In such cases, concrete cases depend on a substantive argument, not on a language lesson. Those who stress language tend to disguise the substantive argument and to conceal the substantive argument behind a (false) claim about the inevitability of a particular specification. 
1996). 

But there is another and somewhat subtler meaning to Holmes' claim. A general proposition may fail to decide concrete cases even if it appears not to be incompletely specified and appears not to include vague or ambiguous language. Suppose, for example, that a statute says that no one may drive over sixty-five miles per hour. A provision of this kind appears to decide concrete cases-in fact, all concrete cases that arise under the provision. But this is false. Suppose, for example, that a police officer is attempting to capture a fleeing felon, or that a driver is trying to escape someone who is shooting at him. In either case there may well be a legally sufficient excuse. Any legal system is likely to authorize judges to make exceptions in cases of absurdity or palpable injustice. If this is so, even a rule-like general proposition will fail to decide concrete cases, since the meaning of the proposition in particular circumstances may not have been fully settled in advance. 
At this point, I want to emphasize that a real pathology of any legal system occurs when an incompletely specified abstraction is said to decide concrete cases. Unfortunately, the pathology is common. It even happens within the Supreme Court. Thus, the Court has sometimes written as if the text of the Equal Protection Clause compels the conclusion that affirmative action programs must be treated the same as ordinary racial discrimination. 4 The text of the clause of course reads: "Nor shall any State. . .deny to any person. . . the equal protection of the laws."" The view that these words necessarily forbid affirmative action, or require it to be treated the same as ordinary discrimination, is a species of formalism in its worst sense-one of the few truly venal sins of legal interpretation. 
Despite frequent protestations to the contrary, there is certainly no clear textual ban on affirmative action. In fact, the textual arguments are entirely inadequate. To be sure, the Constitution calls for "equal" protection of the laws; but on the validity of affirmative action, this point is neither here nor there.6 The term "equal" cannot possibly mean "the same," if we understand "the same" to forbid legal classifications according to one perceived difference. If "equal" meant "the same," then law, which consists of classifications, would not be possible at all. Nor must all classifications be treated "the same." Thus, it is no offense to the Equal racial classifications imposed by government actors to be subject to strict scrutiny); City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 511 (1989) (holding that a city plan which required contractors who were awarded city construction projects to subcontract specified amount to minority-owned businesses violated the Equal Protection Clause); Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 319-20 (1978) (holding that a medical school's admissions policy requiring a certain percentage of minority students violated the Fourteenth Amendment). 

PEOPLE 56-61 (1988) (discussing the evolution of equal protection jurisprudence in the context of affirmative action). Protection Clause if courts scrutinize sex-based classifications more skeptically than they scrutinize age-based classifications, even though this difference does not treat people "the same." The Court's own cases do not violate the Equal Protection Clause insofar as those cases treat different kinds of classification differently. 
The real question is what the word "equal" requires in this context. It is possible to think that the word "equal" requires affirmative action; it is possible to think that the word "equal" forbids affirmative action. The word itself is incompletely specified. The only way to make progress is to go outside of the text. It is there that we must look to find possible understandings of the Constitution's equality principle. 
Nor is it helpful to say that the Constitution speaks of "any person" rather than of groups. The Supreme Court, together with many others, appears to think that the reference to "any person" means that the clause speaks of individuals rather than of groups, and that this point counts strongly against affirmative action.7 The claim contains some truth, but it is highly misleading. To be sure, "any person" may complain that a classification is unacceptable. But under the Equal Protection Clause, all claims of unconstitutionaldiscriminationare based on group status, and no one denies this. This is because anyone who complains of unconstitutional discrimination is necessarily complaining about the government's use, for purposes of classification, of some characteristic that is shared by some number of group members. The only serious question is whether the government's use of that shared characteristic is disfavored from the constitutional point of view. In this sense, claims of unconstitutional discrimination are always group-based claims. 
For example, Jones has a claim to careful scrutiny of laws disadvantaging her if those laws classify on the basis of gender. But she has no such claim if those laws classify on the basis of age.8 She is entitled to a degree of scrutiny corresponding to the basis of the classification of which she complains. As a person, she is always entitled to complain. But the degree of scrutiny is a function not of the fact that she is a "person," but of the characteristic according to which she has been disadvantaged. 
Consider as well many discussions of freedom of speech, where hard cases are sometimes claimed to be settled by the general proposition, stated in the First Amendment, that "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech." 9 It is implausible to say that the First Fourteenth Amendment "protect[s] persons, not groups"); Croson, 488 U.S. at 493 (citing Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 22 (1948), for the proposition that the "rights created by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment are, by its terms, guaranteed to the individual"); Bakke, 43 U.S. at 289; see also RICHARD A. EPSTEIN, FORBIDDEN GRoUNDs 399-405 (similarly discussing United Steelworkers of Am. v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979)). 
(holding that a state police department's mandatory retirement policy did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment). 
50-51 (1995) (claiming that the text of the First Amendment contains no exception for sexAmendment is an "absolute"; the counterexamples-perjury, treason, bribery, fraud-are too insistent. But the use of the general proposition puts people on the defensive in arguing for particular restrictions on the speech. Following Justice Black, many people act as if the general proposition in the text resolves the hard cases.10 This phenomenon may be useful as a social matter, since it helps reduce the regulation of speech. But it is not helpful for clear thinking, and it is also dishonest, for the outcome in the concrete cases will depend on something other than the general proposition. 
The Supreme Court has thus lost sight of Holmes' edict in affirmative action cases, and much of the culture seems to have done the same thing in the context of free speech. But some lawyering suffers from the same vice. In fact, much ineffective advocacy is ineffective because it consists of pressing hard on a general proposition, when the question is the meaning of the proposition in concrete settings-a question that cannot be settled by repeating the general proposition. Lawyering would be far better if it relied less on general propositions and more on the concrete, disputed details on the specific case. 
II. 
CONCRETE CASES 
I turn now to how judges settle concrete cases-and, more specifically, to incompletely theorized agreements on particular outcomes, accompanied by agreements on the narrow or low-level principles that account for them. These terms contain some ambiguities. We might consider, as conspicuous examples of high-level theories, Kantianism and utilitarianism, and see legal illustrations in the many distinguished (academic) efforts to understand such areas as tort law, contract law, free speech, and the law of equality as undergirded by highly abstract theories of the right or the good." By contrast, we might think of low-level principles as including most of the ordinary material of legal "doctrine"-the general class of principles and justifications that are not said to derive from any particular large theories of the right or the good, that have ambiguous relations to large theories, and that are compatible with more than one such theory. 
By the term "particular outcome," I mean the judgment about who wins and who loses a case. By the term "low-level principles," I refer to something relative, not absolute; I mean to do the same thing by the terms "theories" and "abstractions" (which I use interchangeably). In this ual expression but that the Court has consistently and often inexplicably created such exceptions in the area of pornography). 
apply unambiguous principles in the area of sexual speech). 
conceptions of equality and principles that support them); CHARLES FRIED, CONTRACT AS PROIISE: A THEORY OF CoNTRACTuAL OBLIGATION vii (1981) (noting that the one purpose of the book is to show that "a small number of basic moral principles" govern the complex law of contracts). setting, the notions "low-level," "high," and "abstract" are best understood in comparative terms, like the terms "big," "old," and "unusual." The "clear and present danger" standard is a relative abstraction when compared with the claim that members of the Nazi Party may march in Skokie, Illinois.12 But the "clear and present danger" idea is relatively particular when compared with the claim that nations should adopt the constitutional abstraction "freedom of speech." The term "freedom of speech" is a relative abstraction when measured against the claim that campaign finance laws are acceptable, but the same term is less abstract than the grounds that justify free speech, as in, for example, the principle of personal autonomy. 
What I am emphasizing here is that when people diverge on some (relatively) high-level proposition, they might be able to agree when they lower the level of abstraction. Incompletely theorized judgments on particular cases are the ordinary material of law. And in law, the point of agreement is often highly particularized-absolutely as well as relatively particularized-in the sense that it involves a specific outcome and a set of reasons that typically do not venture far from the case at hand. Highlevel theories are rarely reflected explicitly in law. 
The point is especially important in the areas of equality and free speech. In such cases, the Court makes decisions, but they have been incompletely theorized in the sense that the majority does not make a final judgment about what underlies the equality or free speech principle. People can converge on the result-protecting true and nonmisleading commercial speech, offering something other than rational basis review for affirmative action-from many different foundations. Thus the Court's First Amendment jurisprudence reflects no choice among the deepest foundations of the free speech principle. 
Perhaps the participants in law endorse no such theory, or perhaps they believe that they have none, or perhaps they cannot, on a multimember court, reach agreement on a theory. Perhaps they find theoretical disputes confusing or annoying. What is critical is that they agree on the best rule or on how a case must come out. Consider both rules and analogical thinking. Many rules-the speed limit law, the rule requiring people to compensate for intentional torts-can be accepted from diverse foundations. In fact, legal rules often are acceptable to people who diverge on the ultimate basis of law. 
The same is true for analogies. People might think that A is like B, and covered by the same low-level principle, without agreeing on a deep theory to explain why the low-level principle is sound. They agree on the matter of similarity, without agreeing on a large-scale account of what makes the two things similar. In the law of discrimination, for example, many people think that sex discrimination is "like" race discrimination and should be treated similarly, even if they lack or cannot agree on a 916 (1978). general theory of when discrimination is unacceptable. In the law of free speech, many people agree that a ban on speech by a Communist is "like" a ban on speech by a member of the Ku Klux Klan and should be treated similarly-even if they lack or cannot agree on a general theory about the foundations of the free speech principle. What might be said on behalf of incompletely theorized agreements, or incompletely theorized judgments, about particular cases? It is tempting to think of incomplete theorization as quite unfortunate-as embarrassing or reflective of some important problem or defect. Perhaps people have not yet thought deeply enough. When people theorize, by raising the level of abstraction, they do so to reveal bias, or confusion, or inconsistency. Surely participants in a legal system should not abandon this effort. 
There is a good deal of truth in these usual thoughts. Sometimes more in the way of abstraction does reveal prejudice or confusion. But this is not the whole story. On the contrary, incompletely theorized judgments are an important and valuable part of both private and public life. They help make law possible; they even help make life possible. Most of their virtues involve the constructive uses of silence, an exceedingly important social and legal phenomenon. Silence-on something that may prove false, obtuse, or excessively contentious-can help minimize conflict, allow the present to learn from the future, and save a great deal of time and expense. In law, as elsewhere, what is said is no more important than what is left out. Certainly this is true for ordinary courts, which have limited expertise and democratic accountability, and whose limits lead them to be cautious. 
My principal concern is the question of how judges on a multimember body should justify their opinions in public; the argument therefore has a great deal to do with the problem of collective choice. But some of the relevant points bear on other issues as well. They have implications for the question of how an individual judge not faced with the problem of producing a majority opinion-a judge on trial court, for example-might write; they bear on the question of how a single judge, whether or not a member of a collective body, might think in private; and they relate to appropriate methods of both thought and justification wholly outside of the adjudication and even outside of law. 
Begin with the special problem of public justification on a multimember body. The first and most obvious point is that incompletely theorized agreements are well-suited to a world-and especially a legal world-containing social dissensus on large-scale issues. By definition, such agreements have the large advantage of allowing a convergence on particular outcomes by people unable to reach anything like an accord on general principles. This advantage is associated not only with the simple need to decide cases, but also with social stability, which could not exist if fundamental disagreements broke out in every case of public or private dispute.13 In the area of equality, it may be much easier to decide whether a particular practice is legitimate than to decide on a broad theory of human equality. 
Second, incompletely theorized agreements can promote two goals of a liberal democracy and a liberal legal system: to enable people to live together and to permit them to show each other a measure of reciprocity and mutual respect. 4 The use of low-level principles or rules allows judges on multimember bodies and even citizens generally to find commonality and thus a common way of life without producing unnecessary antagonism. Both rules and low-level principles make it unnecessary to reach areas in which disagreement is fundamental. 
Perhaps even more important, incompletely theorized agreements allow people to show each other a high degree of mutual respect, or civility, or reciprocity. Frequently, ordinary people disagree in some deep way on an issue-the Middle East, pornography, homosexual marriages-and sometimes they agree not to discuss that issue much, as a way of deferring to each other's strong convictions and showing a measure of reciprocity and respect (even if they do not at all respect the particular conviction that is at stake). If reciprocity and mutual respect are desirable, it follows that judges, perhaps even more than ordinary people, should not challenge a litigant's or one another's deepest and most defining commitments, at least if those commitments are reasonable and if there is no need for them to do so. Thus, for example, it would be better if judges intending to reaffirm Roe v. Wade" could do so without challenging the judgment that the fetus is a human being. 16 
To be sure, some fundamental commitments might appropriately be challenged in the legal system or within other multimember bodies. Some such commitments are ruled off-limits by the authoritative legal materials. Many provisions involving basic rights have this function. Of course, it is not always disrespectful to disagree with someone in a fundamental way; on the contrary, such disagreements may sometimes reflect profound respect. When defining commitments are based on demonstrable errors of fact or logic, it is appropriate to contest them. So, too, when those commitments are rooted in a rejection of the basic dignity of all human beings, or when it is necessary to undertake the contest to resolve a genuine problem. But many cases can be resolved in an incompletely theorized theorized agreement is possible on a result without being possible on a rationale, and sometimes because one judge wants to theorize an issue more (or less) deeply than do others. Sometimes the existence of a concurring opinion can compromise rule of law values by making it hard to form expectations; sometimes concurring opinions raise issues of collegiality, since authors of majority opinions are not thrilled to find separate concurrences. 
THE PARTuL CONSTrrUTION 257-90 (1993). way, and that is all I am suggesting here. 
Turn now to reasons that call for incompletely theorized agreements whether or not we are dealing with a multimember body. The first consideration here is that incompletely theorized agreements have the crucial function of reducing the political cost of enduring disagreements. If judges disavow large-scale theories, then losers in particular cases lose much less. They lose a decision, but not the world. They may win on another occasion. Their own theory has not been rejected or ruled inadmissible. When the authoritative rationale for the result is disconnected from abstract theories of the good or the right, the losers can submit to legal obligations, even if reluctantly, without being forced to renounce their largest ideals. I have said that some theories should be rejected or ruled inadmissible. But it is an advantage, from the standpoint of freedom and stability, for a legal system to be able to tell most losers-many of whom are operating from foundations that have something to offer, or that cannot be ruled out a priori-thattheir own deepest convictions may play a role elsewhere in the law. 
The second point is that incompletely theorized agreements are valuable when we seek moral evolution over time. Consider the area of constitutional equality, where considerable change has occurred in the past and will inevitably occur in the future. A completely theorized judgment would be unable to accommodate changes in facts or values. If the legal culture really did attain a theoretical end-state, it would become too rigid and calcified; we would know what we thought about everything. This would disserve posterity. 
Incompletely theorized agreements are a key to debates over constitutional equality, with issues being raised about whether gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, and others are analogous to race; such agreements have the important advantage of allowing a large degree of openness to new facts and perspectives. At one point, we might think that homosexual relations are akin to incest; at another point, we might find the analogy bizarre. Of course, a completely theorized judgment would have many virtues if it is correct. But at any particular moment in time, this is an unlikely prospect for human beings, not excluding judges. 
Consider too the fact that in the area of affirmative action, the Court's decisions have been highly case-specific, and that the Court has not offered a final resolution. Instead, it has largely "remanded" the issue to the public for a debate that is now underway. The fact that the Court has eschewed clear rules, and operated so casuistically, may appear to be lamentable, an offense to the rule of law. But it may well fit appropriately with the role of the Court, which decides cases and does not select broad theories of the right or the good. Moral evolution is far more likely to occur-and basic offense to others is less likely-when the Court acts in this fashion. 
A particular concern here is the effect of changing understandings both of facts and of values. Consider ordinary life. At a certain time, you may well refuse to make decisions that seem foundational in character-about, for example, whether to get married within the next year, or whether to have two, three, or four children, or whether to live in San Francisco or New York. Part of the reason for this refusal is knowledge that your understandings of both facts and values may well change. Indeed, your identity may itself change in important and relevant ways, and for this reason a set of commitments in advance-something like a fully theorized conception of your life course-would make no sense. 
Legal systems and nations are not so very different. If the Supreme Court is asked to offer a fully theorized conception of equality-in areas involving, for example, affirmative action, or the rights of disabled people, children, and homosexuals-it may well respond that its job is to decide cases rather than to offer fully theorized accounts, partly because society should learn over time, and partly because society's understandings of facts and values, in a sense its very identity, may well shift in unpredictable ways. The point bears on many legal issues. It helps support the case for incompletely theorized agreements. 
The third point is practical. Incompletely theorized agreements may be the best approach that is available for people of limited time and capacities. Full theorization may be far too much to ask. A single judge faces this problem as much as a member of a multimember panel. Here, too, the rule of precedent is crucial; attention to precedent is liberating, not merely confining, since it frees busy people to deal with a restricted range of problems. Incompletely theorized agreements have the related advantage, for ordinary lawyers and judges, of humility and modesty. To engage in analogical reasoning, for example, one ordinarily need not take a stand on large, contested issues of social life, some of which can be resolved only on what will seem to many a sectarian basis. 
Fourth, incompletely theorized agreements are well-adapted to a system that should or must take precedents as fixed points. This is a large advantage over more ambitious methods, since ambitious thinkers, in order to reach horizontal and vertical coherence, will probably be forced to disregard many decided cases. In light of the sheer number of decided cases and adjudicative officials, law cannot speak with one voice; full coherence in principle is unlikely in the extreme. 
There is a more abstract point here. Human morality recognizes irreducibly diverse goods, which cannot be subsumed under a single "master" value. 17 The same is true for the moral values reflected in the law. Any simple, general, and monistic or single-valued theory of a large area of the law-free speech, contracts, property-is likely to be too crude to fit with our best understandings of the multiple values that are at stake in that area. It would be absurd to try to organize legal judgments through a single conception of value. 
ETHICS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN: ESSAYS IN THE MORALITY OF LAW AND POLITICS 261, 261 (1994). 
What can be said about law as a whole can be said about many particular areas of law. Monistic theories of free speech or property rights, for example, will fail to accommodate the range of values that speech and property implicate. Free speech promotes not simply democracy, but personal autonomy, economic progress, self-development, and other goals as well. Property rights are important not only for economic prosperity, but for democracy and autonomy, too. We are unlikely to be able to appreciate the diverse values at stake and to describe them with the specificity they deserve unless we investigate the details of particular disputes. 
This is not a decisive objection to general theories; a "top down" approach might reject monism and point to plural values. 18 Perhaps participants in democracy or law can describe a range of diverse values, each of them at a high level of abstraction; acknowledge that these values do not fall under a single master value; and use these values for assessing law. But even if correct, any such approach would run into difficulty because of an important practical fact: social disagreements about how best to describe the relevant values. Moreover, any such approach is likely to owe its genesis and its proof-its point or points-to a range of particular cases on which it can build. Of course, full theorization of an area of law would be acceptable, or even an occasion for great celebration, if it accounted for the plural values at issue. But this would be a most complex task, one that requires identification of a wide range of actual and likely cases. At least we can say that incompletely theorized judgments are wellsuited to a moral universe that is diverse and pluralistic, not only in the sense that people disagree, but also in the sense that each of us is attuned to pluralism when we are thinking well about any area of law. 
None of these points suggests that incompletely theorized agreements always deserve celebration. The virtues of such agreements are partial. Some incompletely theorized agreements are unjust. If an agreement is more fully theorized, it will provide greater notice to affected parties. Moreover, fuller theorization-in the form of wider and deeper inquiry into the grounds for judgment-may be valuable or even necessary to prevent inconsistency, bias, or self-interest. If judges have actually agreed on a general theory, and if they are really committed to it, they should say so. Judges and the general community will learn much more if they are able to discuss the true motivating grounds for outcomes. Over time, greater theorization may well make sense. And disagreement plays an important place within courts as well as within democracy. Stability is often good, but an unjust system should probably be made less stable. 
All these are valid considerations, and nothing I am saying here denies their importance. I am instead drawing attention to a pervasive phenomenon, highly characteristic of legal reasoning: legal judgments on a particular case unaccompanied by a deep theory of the right or the good, and joined by people who do not know what they think about foundational issues, or who are in disagreement on such issues. In the areas of equality and free speech, this is a characteristic feature of modern constitutional adjudication, where judges have tended to proceed casuistically, and avoided large-scale theories. 
CONCLUSION 
Legal argument is often weakened by the pretense that general propositions decide concrete cases. From the fact that the Constitution protects freedom of speech, it is often said that a particular conclusion follows with respect to (say) libel or commercial advertising. From the fact that the Constitution bars states from denying any person the equal protection of the laws, it is said that particular conclusions follow for affirmative action. These are species of bad formalism-a practice with continuing influence on the legal culture, and a practice against which Holmes frequently railed. The Supreme Court's performance in affirmative action cases has suffered by virtue of the Court's disregard of Holmes' suggestion, and this is a point that remains true whatever we think, in the end, of affirmative action. And the popular culture's treatment of free speech issues has suffered from a similar pathology, as people derive, from a general proposition, concrete results in hard cases. 
I have sought to draw attention to two important legal phenomena-agreement on abstractions amidst uncertainty about particulars and agreements on particulars amidst uncertainty about abstractions. Constitutionalism-and modern lawmaking-are both made possible by the former phenomenon. Incompletely specified abstractions may well seem inconsistent with the rule of law, but they have important social uses. Moreover, agreements in particulars amidst uncertainty about abstractions are the hallmark of the common law, not excluding that form of common law that we know as constitutional doctrine. In fact, it would not be too much to say that incompletely theorized agreements on particulars are a defining characteristic of Anglo-American adjudication. 
The pervasive place of these kinds of agreements casts doubt on the idea that full theorization is desirable for law, or even that full theorization is possible. I cannot adequately defend this proposition here. Instead, I end with a passage from a somewhat casual but in my view highly illuminating letter from Oliver Wendell Holmes, very much in the spirit of my remarks here, and pointing in the directions in which such a defense might go: 
I read Aristotle's Ethics with some pleasure. The eternal, universal, wise, good man. He is much in advance of ordinary Christian morality with its slapdash universals (Never tell a lie. Sell all thou hast and give to the poor[,] etc.). He has the ideals of altruism, and yet understands that life is painting a picture not doing a sum, that specific cases can't be decided by general rules, and that everything is a question of degree 19 
The fiftieth anniversary of the Administrative Procedure Act2 arrives at a time when administrative institutions are receiving more serious public attention than in any period since the New Deal. The New Deal was committed to immensely strengthened national institutions and to large and largely independent bureaucratic entities? These commitments are now under severe strain. Much of this was signalled by the election of President Reagan in 1980 and, in particular, by his promulgation of a controversial executive order calling for attention to the costs and benefits of regulatory initiatives.4 In 1993, it was firmly established that a new direction had been set, when President Clinton issued a new executive order that substantially overlapped with President Reagan's.5

Nor has the national legislature refused to reexamine the legacy of the New Deal. In 1994 and 1995, Congress devoted a good deal of attention to the costs and benefits of government regulation. Before long, it may enact a "supermandate" requiring cost-benefit balancing from all agencies.' In the near future, Congress may well enact legislation that is a mixture of a new Administrative Procedure Act and an Administrative Substance Act.7 Such legislation may ultimately be seen as part of a "constitutional moment" involving large-scale revision of fundamental national commitments.8 
If such a revision does occur, it will be partly a product of an immense wealth of new learning about the nature and performance of the regulatory state. This learning has emphasized the need for better priority setting,9 for more flexible tools,'0 for balancing rather than absolutism," and for closer attention to the unanticipated adverse effects of regulation.' These points do not suggest that the regulatory state has failed. In many areas, things are much better because of regulatory initiatives." But with better strategies and tools, existing pathologies could be sharply reduced, thus saving many billions of dollars and many lives in the process. For example, a recent study suggests that better allocations of existing health expenditures could save an additional sixty thousand lives with no additional cost-and that with better allocations, we could prevent the same number of deaths we now prevent with $31 billion in annual savings.'4 
During the twentieth-century explosion in regulatory activity-including the New Deal and the "rights revolution" of the 1960s and 1970s-there was no effort to create a general mechanism for monitoring regulatory performance. But with new empirical studies of the effects of regulation, it is now clear that the national government has failed adequately to perform the tasks assigned to it and that it has sometimes made things worse. Increasingly it is asked whether the costs of regulation justify the benefits. Hence assessment of regulatory performance has increasingly taken the form of the criterion of cost-benefit analysis, and hence the American administrative state is increasingly becoming a cost-benefit state. This is so despite the fact that there is much controversy about how to value and characterize both costs and benefits.' 5 
My purpose in this Essay is to discuss a pervasive problem in risk regulation, one that helps account for regulatory failure, that is an intriguing part of cost-benefit assessment," and that is only now receiving public attention.'7 The problem occurs when the diminution of one health risk simultaneously increasesanother health risk. Thus, for example, fuel economy standards, designed to reduce environmental risks, may make automobiles less safe, and in that way increase risks to life and health." Regulations designed to control the spread of AIDS and hepatitis among health care providers may increase the costs of health care, and thus make health care less widely available, and thus cost lives. 9 If government bans the manufacture and use of asbestos, it may lead companies to use more dangerous substitutes.0 Regulation of nuclear power may make nuclear power safer; but by increasing the cost of nuclear power, such regulation will ensure reliance on other energy sources, such as coal-fired power plants, which carry risks of their own.2' When government requires reformulated gasoline as a substitute for ordinary gasoline, it may reduce carbon monoxide emissions but produce new pollution problems from hydrocarbons and smog.22 When government regulates air pollution, it may encourage industry to increase the volume of solid waste, and in that sense aggravate another environmental problem. A ban on carcinogens in food additives may lead consumers to use noncarcinogenic products that carry greater risks in terms of diseases other than cancer." 
The general problem is ubiquitous. It stems from the fact that government officials, like individual citizens and the public as a whole, suffer from both limited information and (even more importantly) selective attention.' A large current priority is to develop mechanisms that overcome the problems posed by the fact that people-both citizens and regulators-tend to focus on problems that are parts of complex wholes. Such a mechanism should take account of Sen's point in the epigraph to this Essay. Risks to life and health are qualitatively diverse, and because of their origins and nature, some risks warrant greater attention than others. 
My goal here is to explore the relation between health-health tradeoffs and the law, in an effort to see how governmental judgments on this topic might be improved. I develop a simple framework for deciding how regulatory agencies should approach such tradeoffs. I suggest that this framework is complicated by reference to some peculiar features of individual and collective rationality in risk assessment. lose their lives as a result.").

I also deal with the respective roles of courts, Congress, and the President in managing health-health tradeoffs. I urge that often agencies ought to be taken to have legal authority to make such tradeoffs, and that they ought to exercise that authority much more than they now do. To this end I argue for an interpretive principle to the effect that agencies should be allowed to consider health-health tradeoffs in the absence of a clear congressional statement to the contrary. I also urge a modest but far from trivial judicial role in requiring agencies to consider aggregate rather than isolated risks. Thus I claim that agency decisions that increase aggregate risk levels should be found arbitrary or capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act.25 
More generally, I urge that Congress should amend the Administrative Procedure Act ("APA") to require agencies to consider ancillary risks and to minimize net risks. I also argue that the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs ("OIRA") should see the reduction of overall risk as one of its principal missions. Much more than it now does, it should undertake a coordinating function so as to ensure that this mission is carried out. 
In these ways, I hope to connect the question of sensible outcomes-outcomes that do not suffer from the problem of excessively selective attention-with the subject of institutional design. A large problem for government institutions is to devise systems to ensure that problems of myopia or selective attention do not defeat regulatory regimes; the management of healthhealth tradeoffs is an important part of that project. 
Part II of this Essay provides a simple conceptual map, designed to draw some relevant distinctions. Part III offers a first approximation of an approach to health-health tradeoffs; this first approximation is an effort to limit aggregate risks understood in "expected value" terms. I then suggest that this approximation must be qualified by reference to some complexities in ordinary citizen judgments about risk. People care not simply about how many lives are saved, but also about whether risks are involuntarily incurred, especially dreaded, inequitably distributed, potentially catastrophic, faced by the current or by future generations, and so forth. Reflective judgments of this sort diverge from both expert and economic valuations, though in interestingly different ways. These reflective judgments bear a great deal on how we think about the "rationality" of risk regula- 5 USC ยง 706(2XA). 
HeinOnline -- 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1537 1996 tion. They also have consequences for the pervasive issue of incommensurability in law. 
Part IV deals with existing law, urging agencies to undertake more health-health tradeoffs than they now do, and explaining how a judicial role could encourage this to happen. Part V deals with how Congress and the President might approach health-health tradeoffs in a way that diminishes the problems associated both with the "pollution of the month" syndrome and with myopia or selective attention. 
Discussions of the administrative state-and proposals for improving it-fall into two general categories. Most familiar is the traditional lawyers' approach, reflected in the Administrative Procedure Act and in much of conventional administrative law. Here we find a range of efforts to limit administrative discretion, mostly through procedural requirements and judicial review. On this view, the basic problem for the administrative state is the exercise of policy-making discretion by unelected bureaucrats; the basic solution is to reduce this discretionary authority." 
The second approach is concerned with improving regulatory performance by asking concrete questions about the effects of regulation.27 On this view, administrative discretion is a problem only to the extent that administrative discretion produces bad outcomes.28 And on this view, administrative law doctrines, and reform proposals for the administrative state, should be founded on a concrete understanding of what strategies will make regulation work better by, for example, saving or lengthening lives, reducing cost, increasing employment, and improving education. 
In my view, lawyers have focused far too much and far too long on the control of administrative discretion, and far too little on the actual effects of administrative behavior on social wellbeing. For the future a critical question is the relationship between administrative law doctrines and those effects. If, for example, administrative discretion is in some domain likely to lead to better outcomes than legislative discretion-as is certainly imaginable in technically complex areas, especially those involving the choice of means for achieving given ends-then there ought to be at least a presumption in favor of administrative discretion. Traditional lawyers might be tempted to reject such discretion by reference to large-sounding abstractions involving, for example, legitimacy, Marbury v Madison2,9 or checks and balances. But if an administrative law doctrine-involving, for example, judicial deference to administrative interpretations of law ---is likely to reduce overall costs and increase the rationality of regulatory law, there is a good argument for that doctrine. 
As the twenty-first century approaches, it is, in short, appropriate for administrative law to focus less on large-sounding abstractions, usually rooted in a controversial understanding of the Constitution, and more on questions that are at once more concrete, more empirical, more manageable, and more directed toward real-world consequences. And though I cannot support the point here, I believe that such a shift would point toward new ways of approaching a host of old questions.3' Let us turn, then, to the important and pervasive issue of health-health tradeoffs as a case in point, and see how administrative law might be revised to deal with that issue. 
To get a handle on the problem of health-health tradeoffs, we need to make some distinctions. Call the risks that government is trying to control the regulated risks. Call the risks that are increased by regulation the ancillaryrisks3.2 
Ancillary risks take many different forms, depending on their relationship to the regulated risk. We might say, for example, that the increase in acid deposition is not within the same do2 5 US (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). 
See, for example, Chevron v NRDC, 467 US 837, 842-45 (1984). 
31 For example, the issue of scope of judicial review might be examined largely by asking about what kind of approach will reduce both costs of decision and costs of error. Chevron itself could be examined under this rubric. The much debated line between Londoner v Denver, 210 US 373 (1908), and Bi-Metallic Investment Co. v State Board of Equalization,239 US 441 (1915), could be understood in similar terms. 
Compare this with the discussion of target risks and countervailing risks in Graham and Wiener, ConfrontingRisk Tradeoffs at 1-2 (cited in note 13). 
HeinOnline -- 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1539 1996 main as the risks prevented by regulation of nuclear power plants. This is true in two different ways, legal and factual. First, and for many purposes most importantly, the law does not consider them in the same domain. The agency that regulates one of these risks, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), has no authority to regulate the other, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC"). A pervasive problem in handling health-health tradeoffs stems from organization charts that allocate authority to diverse agencies, frequently in ways that make it difficult or impossible for agencies to coordinate their responses.33 
Second, the risks of acid deposition (mostly from coal-fired power plants) have a different source from the risks created by nuclear power plants as a simple matter of fact. This point suggests that health-health tradeoffs will often require agencies to compile extensive information, possibly in a way that will dwarf existing capacities. Compare a situation in which the regulation of sulfur dioxide emissions increases carbon monoxide emissions. If this happens, we are dealing in any event with air pollution, indeed air pollution from largely the same technologies, and the EPA has the statutory authority to regulate both sources. 
It is therefore possible to imagine a complex continuum of relationships between regulated risks and ancillary risks. There are, of course, differences among risks--differences of degree as well as differences in kind-especially in the factual domain, where there may or may not be an element of overlap between relevant inquiries. And, of course, we might describe the domain of the regulated risk in many different ways. For some purposes the best way to define the risk domain is through the relevant law, which, as we will see, sets constraints on the kinds of risk that agencies may consider. 
A well-functioning administrative state would seek a measure of coordination among agencies, so that an agency operating in one domain does not inadvertently or unnecessarily increase risks in other domains; and so that risk assessments are made as globally as possible. As a threshold matter, agencies should at the very least coordinate their efforts so as to reduce net or overall risks. But a special problem for coordinated responses is that agencies have quite different standards for deciding when risks require regulation.34 The International Commission on RadiologSee Part V for a discussion of suggested solutions. 
See generally March Sadowitz and John D. Graham, A Survey of Residual Cancer 
HeinOnline -- 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1540 1996 1996] ical Protection, for example, recommends that environmental factors should not cause an incremental cancer risk, for those exposed over a lifetime, of more than about three in one thousand.35 But American agencies do not follow this recommendation. Indeed, their practices vary widely. The NRC sees one in one thousand as acceptable; the EPA's acceptable range varies from one in ten thousand to one in one million." The Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") has tried to use a standard of one in one million, but under the Delaney Clause,37 courts have required a standard of essentially zero.38 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") has interpreted the "significant risk" requirement found in its governing statute to mean a risk of one in one thousand; labor groups have sought a change to one in one million.39 
These varying standards make performing health-health tradeoffs a very complex matter. If one agency is using a standard of one in one thousand for risk A, and doing so lawfully, how should it deal with an increase in risk B, when that risk is regulated by a different agency operating lawfully under a different standard? Matters become even more complex when risks from cancer are being compared with other sorts of risk. 
I do not urge that judgments about significance must be uniform. Contextual differences justify different judgments about which risks warrant special concern.' But such judgments should be made in a self-conscious and informed way, rather than on an ad hoc basis. I return to this issue below. 
There are many different mechanisms by which risk regulation may increase aggregate risks.4' All of these mechanisms have a degree of complexity, and hence collective judgments that respond to them may well misfire. Consider the following: -A regulatory ban may result in independent health risks coming from ancillary "replacement" risks. If we ban substance A, the replacement substance B may also be dangerous. If a carcinogenic substance is regulated, perhaps people will use a product that is not carcinogenic but that causes serious risks of heart disease. 
-Regulation may produce a new, offsetting risk that is qualitatively similar to or indistinguishable from the target risk. Perhaps regulation of certain substances that threaten to destroy the ozone layer will produce new reliance on other substances that also threaten the ozone layer. 
-Regulation may force society to forego "opportunity benefits." For example, the careful screening procedures that keep drugs and services from prematurely entering the marketplace may also deprive people of certain health benefits. This problem has received recent attention with respect to the Food and Drug Administration, especially with the "drug lag" and the agency's efforts to control the spread of AIDS.42 
-Regulated substances may create health benefits as well as health risks. By eliminating those health benefits, regulation may therefore create a net increase in health dangers. 
-Regulation of one risk may protect a certain group of people while imposing a new risk on another group. This would happen, for example, if a ban on a certain pesticide protects consumers, plants, and animals, but simultaneously increases risks to farmers. Perhaps regulations protecting men from certain risks will impose new risks on women. 
-Most generally, the economic costs imposed by regulation may create health risks, as I discuss below in Part II.B. 
When officials think about health-health tradeoffs, the distributional incidence of the ancillary risk may matter a great deal for policy purposes. Sometimes the ancillary risk falls on the same class of people as the regulated risk; sometimes the ancillary risk burdens an entirely different group. This suggests that risk redistribution,rather than risk reduction, is a possible goal and outcome of regulation. Interest groups may well try to exploit this possibility. Hence it should be expected that odd coalitions will develop to reduce risks of a certain kind when the result is to shift risks (and control costs) from some groups to others.' 42 A general description can be found in President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, ReinventingDrug & MedicalDevice Regulations(US GPO 1995). See also Miranda Perry, Health-HealthAnalysis and the FDA (unpublished manuscript on file with U Chi L Rev).

HeinOnline -- 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1542 1996 
Thus far we have been discussing cases in which the act of regulating one risk produces ancillary risks through a certain causal chain. There is a particularly controversial possibility here, one that has been receiving much recent attention. Regulations cost money-sometimes a great deal of money-and private expenditures on regulatory compliance may produce less employment and more poverty. People who are unemployed or poor tend to be in worse health and to live shorter lives." If wealthy people face diminished threats to life and health, and if poor people face greater threats, might not costly regulation increase risks simply by virtue of reducing wealth? 
There are several reasons why this might be so.' First, people with more wealth have more capacity to spend their income on health-enhancing goods and activities. There is strong evidence to this effect; for example, poor people have inferior housing and a lower rate of smoke detector installment, and this may well be connected with greater death rates from fire." Second, people who are poorer also suffer from various stresses that may have adverse health effects. Stress itself can contribute to morbidity and mortality; it can, for example, lead to an increase in heart disease. Finally, greater social wealth seems to be associated with more general social changes in the direction of greater safety, though the relevant mechanism is not well understood. 
This possibility has been reflected in legal opinions, perhaps most prominently in Judge Easterbrook's suggestion that a fetal protection policy might "reduce risk attributable to lead at the cost of increasing other hazards," including the hazards stemming from less income, since "there is also a powerful link between the parents' income and infants' health."47 The more gen 
eral question is this: Would it be possible to make precise connections between governmentally required expenditures on risk reduction with shifts in unemployment and poverty? 
An incipient literature attempts to do precisely this. A 1990 study attempted to develop a model to quantify the view that "richer is safer."' According to Ralph Keeney, a single fatality might result from a compulsory expenditure of from $6.49 million to $7.25 million; with different assumptions about the distributional incidence of the costs, the estimate could range between $3 million and $12 million.49 In a concurring opinion in a 1991 case involving occupational safety and health regulation, Judge Williams invoked this evidence to suggest that OSHA's refusal to engage in cost-benefit analysis might not be beneficial for workers." Judge Williams reasoned in the following way. If a fatality results from an expenditure of $7.5 million, then some regulations might produce more fatalities than they prevent. Many regulations of course cost more than $7.5 million per life saved. In Judge Williams's view, an agency that fails to measure costs against benefits might be failing to measure mortality gains against losses. 
The claimed relationship between wealth reductions and mortality is controversial,5' but a number of studies have found such a relationship. There is a growing consensus, from diverse studies, that regulatory expenditures can increase mortality. Consider this summary: dissenting), rev'd, 499 US 187 (1991). See also Mary E.

Even if agencies are sometimes prevented, by law, from measuring costs against benefits,5 3 perhaps they can compare health losses with health gains, and conclude that some regulations are not worthwhile because they cost lives in the aggregate. In fact it can be shown that some regulations fail health-health analysis whether or not they pass cost-benefit analysis. Thus we might be able to agree that such regulations are counterproduc

The idea that "richer is safer" has started to affect public deliberations about risk. In a now celebrated letter written in 1992, James MacRae, the Acting Administrator of OIRA, wrote to the Department of Labor questioning a proposed regulation of air contaminants in the workplace.5 5 OSHA had estimated savings of between eight and thirteen lives per year, at an annual cost of $163 million. MacRae suggested that there was a significant gap in OSHA's analysis: If a statistical fatality is produced by an expenditure of $7.5 million, the regulation could actually cause ' See Keeney,8 J Risk & Uncertainty at 96 (cited in note 48), discussing letter from James B. MacRae, Jr., Acting Administrator and Deputy Administrator, Office ofInformation and Regulatory Affairs, U.S. Office of Management and Budget, to U.S. Department of Labor (Mar 10, 1992). twenty-two additional deaths. MacRae asked OSHA to investigate the relation between health, wealth, and safety. OSHA responded that existing data to the effect that "richer is safer" seemed highly speculative, but it did call for more comments from the public."6 
Eventually, a public outcry forced OIRA to retreat. Senator Glenn in particular complained of OIRA's "Alice-in-Wonderland type claim that health and safety regulations cause harm to workers" and objected that the "richer is safer" view "seems to stand logic on its head-to say that controlling a dangerous substance in the workplace makes an increased health hazard to the worker.""7 Despite the public outcry, further research on the issue suggests that lives can indeed be lost through required regulatory expenditures. At a minimum government ought to consider the problem seriously. 
If officials are to consider the fact that "richer is safer," it is important to know whether the burdens of regulation fall on those who are poor and near poor or those who are rich. Simple intuition suggests that a loss in income from relatively poor people will have more severe health effects than a similar loss from the relatively well off. A recent study confirms the intuition." It suggests that when program costs are borne exclusively by the richest 20 percent of the population, mortality effects are one-half as high as when program costs are borne exclusively by the poorest 20 percent of the nation.59 Thus it is necessary to know the distributional incidence of costs in order to see the extent to which "richer is safer." 
We have now seen enough to know that an impressive body of work attempts to measure health gains from regulation against health risks from regulation. But why should we focus on this particular question? Would it not be better to attend to the overall gains from regulation and to the overall losses from reg' Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Air Contaminants, 57 Fed Reg 26002, 26005-09 (1992).

Cost-benefit analysis is receiving considerable attention in both agencies 0 and Congress,6 and cost-benefit analysis, properly conceived, takes account of all of the health-related effects of regulation. Health-health assessments focus on a subset of effects, and refuse to translate those effects into dollars. Such assessments ignore all costs unrelated to mortality and morbidity. But what is special about health-health tradeoffs? Why should analysis focus on such tradeoffs rather than on all relevant effects? 
Part of the answer lies in existing public judgments, taken as simple brute facts. People seem to think that regulation is bad if it causes more deaths than it prevents; a demonstration that a particular regulation has this effect would count strongly against its adoption. But people do not always know how to compare health gains (fifteen lives gained, for example) with monetary losses (an expenditure of $15 million, for example). This uncertainty stems partly from the fact that lives and dollars are not easily made commensurable,62 and partly from the fact that the appropriate amount to spend on protection of a (statistical) life depends very much on context. 
A deliberative judgment about how to assess net health tradeoffs is easier to reach than a deliberative judgment about how to assess cost-benefit tradeoffs. It may thus be possible to obtain an incompletely theorized agreement 63-- incompletely theorized in the sense that people from diverse theoretical perspectives can agree-that a net mortality loss is bad. Incompletely theorized agreements on particular results are an important part of democratic deliberation; they are a distinctive solution to the problems of social pluralism and disagreement. 
See, for example, Exec Order No 12866, 3 CFR at 638 (cited in note 5). 
61 See Sunstein, 48 Stan L Rev at 269-86 (cited in note 7). For a valuable overview, see Hahn, Regulatory Reform (cited in note 11) (finding that about half of government regulations since 1990 would not pass a cost-benefit test). 
' I am therefore rejecting the suggestion in Graham and Wiener that the problem of incommensurability stems from current methods of comparison: 'iI]t is chiefly our lack of methods of comparison-of ways of seeing commonality among these risks-that makes these risks seem 'dissimilar' or noncomparable, not an inherent incommensurability. As we improve methods of risk analysis, the idea of calculating the 'net risk' of a risk portfolio, or the change in net risk due to a risk tradeoff, may become more meaningful." ConfrontingRisk Tradeoffs at 33 (cited in note 13). The problem of incommensurability stems not from a lack of methods of comparison, but from human perceptions of qualitative differences among diverse risks. Moreover, incommensurability need not be identified with incomparability. 
' See Cass R. Sunstein, Incompletely Theorized Agreements, 108 Harv L Rev 1733 (1995). 
It would, however, be inadequate for present purposes to rely on existing public judgments, which may be irrational or confused. Perhaps public uncertainty about cost-benefit judgments depends on an obstinate and counterproductive unwillingness to acknowledge that even (risk to) life has its price and that risks are matters of degree rather than "dangerous or not."' 
But part of the answer can be found in information costs. The comparative defect of health-health assessment is also its virtue: it involves only a subset of the consequences of regulating. Fewer facts need to be compiled. The assessment may economize on the costs of inquiry into speculative issues about regulatory consequences. 
Another part of the answer may lie in attending more closely to problems of incommensurability. We might understand incommensurability to arise when no single metric is available by which to assess the variables at stake in a social decision.65 In the area of risk regulation, a single metric is troublesome simply because it blurs qualitative distinctions. The vice and virtue of cost-benefit analysis is that it attempts to provide such a metric. If all effects are reduced to the metric of dollars, it may be possible to make simple assessments, in the sense that comparisons and hence tradeoffs can become easier. But the reduction of mortality and morbidity effects to dollars can erase important qualitative distinctions among diverse risks. These qualitative distinctions matter, and hence it is important for officials to understand them when they make decisions. 
It is in the face of qualitative distinctions-distinctions in how, not simply how much, things are valued-that participants in democratic deliberation often resist a metric of dollars. To say this is not to say that there is a problem of incomparability or that tradeoffs do not have to be made among qualitatively diverse goods. But perhaps people can make choices more easily when the tradeoffs involve things that may seem qualitatively indistinguishable, like lives, rather than qualitatively diverse things, like lives and dollars. Most simply, when it is hard to trade off lives against dollars, the burdens of judgment might be eased when we are trading off lives against lives. A judgment of this kind undoubtedly underlies the interest in health-health analysis. 
There is considerable truth to this suggestion. But it is a bit too crude. As we shall see, lives are themselves not commensurable, in the sense that a single metric--lives saved"-is itself too coarse-grained to account for people's considered judgments. We do not reason well if we think that two lives should always be traded for, say, two and a half lives. A great deal depends on the context in which those statistical lives are put at risk (and on what those lives would be like).66 For this reason problems of incommensurability cannot be eliminated so easily. They play a large role in health-health comparisons too. 
What solutions are possible? It may be possible to reduce these problems by looking not at total lives lost or gained, but at the effects of regulation on the number of quality-adjusted life years." A regulation that saves thirteen children while jeopardizing fifteen elderly people may well be worthwhile, at least if the thirteen children are likely to have decent life prospects. Government might thus focus on statistical years rather than statistical lives. Through attending to years rather than lives saved, and also by making judgments about the nature of years saved, problems of incommensurability can be reduced though certainly not eliminated. 
A. First Approximation 
Let us try, in a simple, intuitive way, to identify the factors that should enter into deliberative judgments about health-health tradeoffs. Begin with a simple case in which the costs of information and inquiry are zero. If this is so, all agencies should investigate all risks potentially at stake. Agencies should always take account of ancillary risks and always try to limit overall or aggregate risks. 
Of course the costs of investigation and inquiry are never zero; to the contrary, they are often very high. We can readily imagine that agencies could spend all their time investigating ancillary risks and never do anything else-a disaster for regulatory policy.68 (This is a potential problem with cost-benefit analSee note 1 and accompanying text. 
Richard Zeckhauser and Donald Shepard, Where Now for Saving Lives?, 40 L & Contemp Probs 5, 11-32 (Autumn 1976). 
' This may be the goal of some proposals for regulatory reform. See Sunstein, 48 
HeinOnline -- 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1552 1996 1996] ysis: cost-benefit analysis may itself fail cost-benefit analysis-if the costs of undertaking cost-benefit analysis are high and the benefits lower.) When the costs of inquiry are not zero, the obligation to inquire into ancillary risks might be a function of several factors. Firstis the cost of delay, understood as the cost of not controlling the regulated risk until more information has been compiled. To assess this cost, it is necessary to explore the seriousness of the regulated risk and the length of time necessary to investigate the ancillary risk. Second is the cost of investigating the ancillary risk, where this cost is understood as a product of the cost of compiling and evaluating the relevant information. Third is the benefit of investigating the ancillary risk, with the benefit understood as the likelihood of uncovering information that might help to produce a different and better result. 
Under this view, it is of course (and unfortunately) important to know at least something about the possible extent of the ancillary risk and the costs of discovering it. Hence there is a problem of circularity: it is impossible to know whether to undertake health-health analysis without first doing a bit of health-health analysis, at least by making some initial judgments about the ancillary risk-a risk that, by hypothesis, the agency has not yet explored. Before the actual investigation has occurred, there will be a good deal of intuition and guesswork; the full facts cannot be known until inquiries have been completed, and the real question is whether it is worthwhile to complete the inquiries or even to embark on them.69 
But even at an early stage, it is possible to know that some ancillary risks are likely to be high, while others are likely to be trivial or low. Moreover, some ancillary risks can be investigated at low cost, while others depend on scientific and predictive judgments that require enormous investments of time and resources. There is an analogy here to the question of whether and when agencies must explore alternatives under either the National Environmental Policy Act or the APA. Here courts have indicated that some, but not all, alternatives must be investigated, and the outcome turns on considerations like those I have been discussing."ยฐ Of course, an agency might be reluctant to inquire into Stan L Rev at 271 (cited in note 7). 
' Compare Vermont Yankee NuclearPower Corp v NRDC, 435 US 519, 551-55 (1978) (holding that agency need not address every alternative, but only those realistically available within the time frame of the proposal). 
"' See id. See also William H. Rodgers, Jr., EnvironmentalLaw ยง 9.8 at 957-63 (West 2d ed 1994) (detailing judicial rHeesipnoOnnsleinseto--V63erUm.oCnhti.YLa.nRkeeve.).1553 1996 ancillary risks on the theory that, if it does so, it will be unable to regulate the risk at issue within a reasonable period of time. It seems clear that the extent and nature of the regulated risk are crucial factors for those deciding whether to explore ancillary risks. 
On this simple, intuitive view, an agency might reason in the following way: If it would be enormously expensive to investigate whether fuel economy standards would really produce smaller and more dangerous cars, if the fuel economy standards would themselves do a lot of good, and if the likelihood of a high ancillary risk seems small, then it makes sense to proceed with the fuel economy standards without investigating ancillary risks." On the other hand, it is easy to imagine scenarios in which investigation of ancillary risks would be reasonable and the failure to investigate would be irrational. Thus, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration's ("NHTSA") actual position with respect to fuel economy standards and safety is that the ancillary risk is worth investigating. 2 
Compare the question of how to handle ancillary risks created by the prohibited manufacture of asbestos. One ancillary risk arises because asbestos appears to be the safest and thus best product for use in brake linings. Whether this is true, and how serious the ancillary risk is, can be investigated at the present time. But other ancillary risks involve the eventual substitutes for asbestos in products for which no substitutes are now available. On the view of the EPA, the ban on asbestos will force technological innovation, producing new substances that do the work now done by asbestos." This may be a reasonable though speculative view. If so, the government has reason to regulate asbestos now and to wait before evaluating the risks posed by substitutes. 
B. Existing Law and its Rationale 
How should we understand existing law in light of this first approximation? Congress has apparently forbidden health-health analysis in many settings by directing agencies to focus on cer71 Compare this, however, with the EPA's position in CorrosionProofFittingsv EPA, 947 F2d 1201, 1220 (5th Cir 1991) (proceeding with a ban on asbestos despite the possibility of ancillary risk from substitutes on the theory that new substitutes will develop because of the ban). See also note 73 and accompanying text. 
72 See text accompanying notes 114-20 7' CorrosionProofFittings,947 F2d at 1220. 
HeinOnline -- 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1554 1996 tain health problems to the exclusion of all others.74 Questions naturally arise about what understanding, if any, accounts for these prohibitions. 
Some of the relevant statutes might be seen to reflect categorical, rule-bound judgments reflecting factors of the kind just discussed. Congress might think, for example, that the NRC should not ask whether regulation of nuclear power will cause a shift to coal-fired power plants and thus aggravate the problem of acid deposition (a) because the problem of unsafe nuclear power is an especially urgent one and (b) because it would be very hard for the NRC, given its limited budget and expertise, to make the necessary extrapolations. Under the considerations I have discussed, Congress might plausibly exempt the NRC from the duty of exploring ancillary risks, or even ban it from doing so. 
Alternatively, the problems posed by ancillary risks might be solved by a healthy division of labor.The problems posed by coalfired power plants are the EPA's responsibility. Any effects on automobile safety that come from air pollution regulation producing smaller cars might be controlled by NHTSA. Perhaps NHTSA has the authority to make sure that the ancillary risk does not come to fruition. Perhaps the two agencies will coordinate their efforts to ensure that aggregate risks are minimized. Or consider the health risks from regulation inducing unemployment and poverty. It might be thought that these adverse effects are or should be addressed by other governmental institutions, including those entrusted with the power to reduce unemployment and poverty. 
Of course there are serious problems with the division-oflabor strategy. Coordination of risk regulation is difficult to achieve, and in modern government, it has not been pursued in any systematic way.7" In any case it would be extravagant to suggest that a healthy division of labor accounts for existing practice. If there were such a division of labor, agencies would systematically respond to increases in ancillary risk created by other agencies; but there is no evidence of such responses. 7' See note 53 and accompanying text. 
75 However, some efforts at coordination are prescribed in Exec Order No 12866, 3 CFR at 638 (cited in note 5). For example, ยง 1(bX10) directs agencies to "avoid regulations that are inconsistent, incompatible, or duplicative with its other regulations or those of other Federal Agencies." Id at 640. Similarly, ยง 2(b) emphasizes that the Office of Management and Budget ("OMB") is to review and coordinate all agency rulemaking, in part to ensure "that regulations... do not conflict with the policies or actions taken or planned by another agency." Id. 
Another explanation for why existing law makes relevant some risks but not others points to the important role of interest groups in the regulatory process.7 6 On this view, selective attention and disparities in regulatory strategies are attributable to the fact that well organized groups are able to obtain legislation in their interests and to fend off regulation that would be harmful to their interests. It should be unsurprising that the statute regulating agricultural practices allows for a form of open-ended balancing;" the agricultural groups are in a good position to fend off draconian legislation. Some environmental groups work very hard to obtain severe restrictions on carcinogenic substances. 78 
In fact, interest groups might work together so as to redistribute risks, and the resulting coalitions might well ban agencies from engaging in health-health analysis for fear that the result will be decreased redistribution. If, for example, corn producers attempt to obtain an ethanol requirement for gasoline, they will not be disturbed to find that ethanol itself imposes environmental risks. Or if it happens that electric cars produce environmental hazards because of waste disposal problems, the redistribution of the risk may not be bothersome to those who favor electric cars on self-interested grounds. It would even be possible to imagine cases in which the redistributed risk was affirmatively sought, if, for example, those who face the new risk are competitors. Undoubtedly, an investigation of the political economy of risk regulation would reveal many diverse cases in which interest groups pursue their own interests rather than overall risk reduction. 79 
Other explanations would point to myopia, selective attention, sensationalism,loss aversion, credit-claiming,and random agenda selection.0 Some statutes stem from sensationalistic events-the Love Canal scare is one example of this tendency-that encourage legislators to hold hearings, enact legislation, and claim credit for fixing problems that are either not very large " See the discussion of "omitted voices" in Graham and Wiener, Confronting Risk Tradeoffs at 34-36 (cited in note 13). 
" The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act ("FIFRA") directs the EPA to regulate pesticides that have "unreasonable adverse effects on the environment." 7 USC ยง 136a(a) (1994). FIFRA defines these "unreasonable effects" to include "any unreasonable risk... taking into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of the use of any pesticide." 7 USC ยง 136(bb) (1994). 
78 For a discussion of health-health tradeoffs under the Delaney Clause, see Merrill, 5 Yale J Reg at 74-88 (cited in note 23). 
,9 See note 22. 'o These are important points in Breyer, Breaking the Vicious Circle (cited in note 9). 
HeinOnline -- 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1556 1996 1996] or that are just a part of a complex whole. Such statutes are likely to reflect myopia or selective attention.8' The result may well be a form of random agenda selection that bans healthhealth tradeoffs, that does not adequately reduce risks, or that even increases some risks. Moreover, people are pervasively averse to losses from the status quo-more so than they are favorably inclined to improvements from the status quo--and loss aversion may account for apparently irrational judgments about how to trade off health risks. 
Finally, some statutes might reflect public judgments about how to conduct health-health tradeoffs. Perhaps the public believes that an increase in a certain risk is not a relevant factor in the assessment of another risk. This could be a product of simple confusion, as in the well-established refusal, on the part of some of the public some of the time, to acknowledge any need for tradeoffs.' Such judgments should not be given any weight in law. Nevertheless, Congress, responsive as it is to the wishes of the electorate, appears to disagree with this proposition. Or public judgments might be based on heuristics of certain kinds, productive of errors," or on gripping anecdotes that make draconian regulation of a certain risk seem quite sensible. In these ways, public judgments could be confused; we might prefer a form of expert judgment that would produce more in the way of regulatory rationality.85 
These judgments might, however, result from something other than confusion. They might depend on judgments about sensible regulatory priorities and about qualitative differences among risks. I take up this point below. 
Our first approximation has suggested that all risks should be aligned along a single metric-expected annual deaths, aggregate mortality benefits-and hence measured against each other. Both expert and economic approaches attempt to do this, though in interestingly different ways. Experts tend to look at expected nature of risk permanence duration equity source of risk freedom annual deaths and to assess risks accordingly.8 6 But ordinary people base their judgments on something quite different. They look, for example, at whether the risk is faced voluntarily or involuntarily; whether it is distributed equitably; whether it is faced by future generations; whether it is potentially catastrophic; whether it involves a type of death that is especially dreaded; and whether it is new and poorly understood. Consider the following summary: 
reversible/controllable faced by future generations 
faced by those now living unfairly distributed man-made voluntarily incurred 
Mitigating factor acceptable fairly distributed found in nature forced exposure unknown old existing understanding 
known to science relation to status quo 
new 
If aggravating and mitigating factors are taken into account, it might well be the case that people would find, say, 300 cases of cancer less acceptable than 350 cases of heart disease, given certain assumptions about what causes each. In contingent valuation studies, people purport to be willing to pay far more to prevent cancer deaths (from $1.5 million to $9.5 million) than they would to prevent unforeseen instant deaths (from $1 million to $5 million).87 It is similarly possible that people might therefore accept a regulated risk involving 100 annual fatalities even if the ancillary risk involves 110 annual fatalities; perhaps the ancillary risk is less severe because it is voluntarily run, not especial' See Paul Slovic, Baruch Fischhoff, and Sarah Lichtenstein, CharacterizingPerceived Risk, in Robert W. Kates, Christoph Hohenemser, and Jeanne Y. Kasperson, eds, PerilousProgress:Managingthe Hazardsof Technology 91, 112 (Westview 1985); Richard H. Pildes and Cass R.

HeinOnline -- 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1558 1996 1996] ly dreaded, and well understood. The democratic decision to look at something other than quantity is easy to defend. It is filly rational. 
We come, then, to a complication for the initial approximation: risks should be evaluated in accordance with the various qualitative factors deemed relevant by ordinary people who are evaluating risk.88 Of course, it would be possible to assign numbers to these factors if this step aided analysis. 
Economic approaches promise to avoid some of the problems of expert valuations. Most important, private willingness to pay should incorporate some or even all of the factors that underlie ordinary lay judgments. It might be possible to ascertain private willingness to pay from studies of actual market behavior and from contingent valuation studies.89 And from these results it would be possible to derive the diverse valuations of diverse social risks. Consider the following table: 
1 
Low 8 This proposition is defended in detail in Pildes and Sunstein, 62 U Chi L Rev at 55-95 (cited in note 86). Some complications are discussed in Cass R. Sunstein, Which Risks First?,1997 U Chi Legal F (forthcoming 1997) (on file with U Chi L Rev) (exploring problems in ordinary valuations and arguing that voluntariness and control should not be taken as clear categories, but as pointing to low costs of risk avoidance). 
' See Tolley, Kenkel, and Fabian, State-of-the-Art Health Values at 323-44 (cited in note 87); Viscusi, FatalTradeoffs at 34-74 (cited in note 15). 
' Tolley, Kenkel, and Fabian, State-of-the-Art Health Values at 342 table 15.5 (cited in note 87). 
There are, however, enormous difficulties in the idea that officials can get, from private willingness to pay, an adequate sense of how to order the risks at stake in regulation. Healthhealth tradeoffs cannot easily be based on surrogates for market valuation. Actual choices are "noisy"; from a market decision-to take a job, to buy a Volvo, to get a smoke alarm-it is not easy to derive a consistent valuation of life. Such decisions are highly geared to the context in which they are made; it is not clear that one can infer from actual choices in one context people's valuations about other choices in different contexts. 
Contingent valuation studies can build in a sense of context, but the answers may not be reliable. They may well be a product of strategic behavior, of questions and answers not thought meaningful in real life, or of a perceived purchase of moral satisfaction rather than any commodity. Valuation is greatly affected by whether the good is offered alone or in connection with other goods. Wildly different responses can be elicited depending on the sequence of questions; and people often give the same amount to reflect their willingness to save twenty thousand or two million members of a certain species." In any case, democratic choices should reflect a process of reason-giving in which it is asked what policies are best to pursue, rather than a process of preferencesatisfaction in which each person is asked how much he is willing to pay for a certain result.92 Deliberative outcomes should not be confused with aggregated willingness to pay. 
Government officials must, in these circumstances, proceed pragmatically and experimentally, perhaps by taking aggregate numbers based on expert judgments as a starting point, focusing on number of quality-adjusted life years saved rather than simply lives saved, and invoking the supplemental considerations involving democratic convictions that I have described here. 
I now turn to existing law. If an agency takes account of ancillary risks, has it behaved unlawfully? If an agency refuses to consider such risks, should courts require it do so?

Suppose first that an agency actually considers health-health tradeoffs. Is it permitted to do so under existing law? Agencies have considerable flexibility here, since under current doctrine, agencies have discretion to interpret ambiguities in their governing statutes as they see fit.93 If the governing statute is ambiguous, agencies should be permitted to consider health-health tradeoffs. 
Sometimes, however, statutes are unambiguous on this point, and ancillary risks are excluded as reasons for regulatory action or inaction. Under the Delaney Clause,94 for example, the FDA is generally believed to be banned from considering the possibility that the exclusion of foods with carcinogens will increase risks from heart disease. The FDA is apparently prohibited from considering this or any other ancillary risk.95 A similar problem arises under the toxic substances provision of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which probably bans OSHA from asking whether richer is safer, or even from balancing workplace risks against ancillary risks created by regulation.96 
But sometimes agencies are given sufficiently broad authority, and they may, if they choose, consider ancillary risks. For example, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act ("FIFRA") provides that agencies must ask whether pesticides produce "unreasonable adverse effects on the environment,"97 and this term requires the agency to take "into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of the use of any pesticide." 8 Thus FIFRA certainly authorizes the EPA to consider the possibility that a regulation will create aggregate harms. The Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA") reads in similar terms.99 The Clean Air Act allows the government to consider a broad range of good and bad environmental effects in requir" See Chevron v NRDC, 467 US 837, 842-45 (1984) (holding that courts should defer to reasonable agency interpretations whenever statutory language is ambiguous). 21 USC ยงยง 348(cX3XA), 360b(dX1XI), 379e(bX5XB). 
See PublicCitizen v Young, 831 F2d 1108, 1117-18 (DC Cir 1987); Les v Reilly, 968 F2d 985, 988-90 (9th Cir 1992).

It is permitted to consider the effects of regulation in causing risks to life and health through poverty and unemployment. 
We might go further. As noted, courts generally defer to reasonable agency interpretations of law. In addition, statutes are generally interpreted so as to avoid absurdity, even in the face of apparently clear text.' 2 For the modern regulatory state, it would make sense for courts to adopt a new interpretive principle to the effect that agencies are permitted to minimize net risks to life and health, a principle that Congress can overcome only with a clear statement to the contrary. This principle makes particular sense in light of the fact that the agency is in the best position to decide whether consideration of health-health tradeoffs would be feasible, or instead a barrier to successful implementation of the underlying statute. Compared with courts, agencies are both technically expert and democratically accountable; they are also in a uniquely good position to obtain a systematic overview of the statutes they administer, and that position can enable them to counteract unintended harmful consequences." 3 
There is a pervasive choice, central to administrative law, between comprehensive rationality on the one hand and limited information on the other. If an agency tries to administer the statute so as to move in the direction of comprehensive rationality by ensuring that ancillary health risks are considered, it should be allowed to do so. Congress should not lightly or inadvertently be taken to have forbidden agencies from ensuring that 100 See, for example, 42 USC ยงยง 7411(a)(1), 7521(a)(3)(A) (1994). 101 29 USC ยง 652(8) (1994). 
1"0 See, for example, Riggs v Palmer,115 NY 506, 22 NE 188 (1889) (statute clearly requiring execution of a testator's will is interpreted not to require execution if it would benefit the testator's murderer); Church of the Holy Trinity v United States, 143 US 457 (statute clearly prohibiting the importation of any foreigners to perform "labor or service of any kind" is interpreted not to apply to religious organizations or services). 
10 See Cass R. Sunstein, Law and Administration After Chevron, 90 Colum L Rev 2071, 2087-91 (1990). regulations do not create net harm and that they create the greatest possible net benefit. 
This idea casts some doubt on the courts' approach to the Delaney Clause. In Les v Reilly, the EPA sought to create a de minimis exception to the Clause insofar as it prohibits the use of any food additive that has been found to "induce cancer." "' The FDA had made a similar argument in Public Citizen v Young, where the agency sought to exempt substances that created a one-in-a-million lifetime risk of cancer-the same risk that would be run if a consumer ate one peanut with the FDA-permitted level of aflatoxins once every 250 days, and a risk less than one two-hundredth the lifetime risk incurred by the average male smoker.0 5 In both cases, the government urged in essence that "de minimis non curat lex." But in Les, part of the EPA's rationale came close to a suggestion that the exception may well, on balance, decrease risks to life and health. According to the EPA, the Clause might allow substances on the market that are actually less dangerous than other substances that are permitted because they do not concentrate in processed foods. 
In neither case did the government seriously press the claim that the Delaney Clause, if interpreted literally, would increase health risks. Many people so urge."ยฐ If the government had done so, and offered a convincing factual demonstration to that effect, it should have been permitted to interpret the Clause so as to decrease risk on balance. The practice of statutory construction is pervaded by interpretive principles designed to give reason and justice the benefit of the doubt.' 7 To existing principles, the courts should add a suggestion that if at all possible, statutes will not be construed so as to block agencies from taking account of health-health tradeoffs.' ยฐ8 10 968 F2d 985, 986 (9th Cir 1992). 105 831 F2d 1108, 1111 (DC Cir 1987).

Sometimes, rules of contract law and statutory interpretation are designed to create incentives to force parties to speak clearly. Perhaps a literal interpretation of the Delaney Clause would force Congress to think in a more systematic way; perhaps an interpretive principle of the sort I have suggested would decrease that incentive.

Now suppose that an agency refuses to consider, or to make decisive, the fact that its decision to reduce one risk increases another risk. Perhaps a new regulatory initiative from the NRC would increase the risks from coal-fired power plants. Is the NRC's refusal to consider such risks unlawful? The first question is whether the statute requires consideration of ancillary risks. The second question is whether, if the statute does not do so, the agency's decision is nonetheless arbitrary or capricious. 
As we have seen, many statutes do not require agencies to consider ancillary risks. In any case, courts defer to reasonable agency interpretations of statutes,0 9 so in many instances the agency will have the authority to decide whether to consider ancillary risks. If the agency has the statutory authority not to consider ancillary risks, it is unlikely, under current law, to be held that its decision not to do so was arbitrary. The judgment about arbitrariness should and probably would be based on a framework like that set out in Part III above.11ยฐ In an extreme case, failure to consider risks that are likely to be large, and that are not terribly costly to investigate, might be seen as arbitrary within the meaning of the APA."' Indeed, I believe, for reasons to be elaborated shortly, that courts should be less reluctant than they now are to find agency action arbitrary on this ground. 
A great deal, of course, turns on existing information. When the data about ancillary risks are speculative or unreliable, agencies are probably not required to consider such risks." OSHA could lawfully conclude-as it has in fact concluded"'-that the evidence that "richer is safer" is too speculative to be used at this literalism has led or is leading Congress to be more attentive to the problem of unintended bad consequences.

Its decision to this effect ought not to be found arbitrary or capricious unless it can be shown that the evidence is in fact solid and that the costs of incorporating it are reasonable. The relevant provision of the statute-the "reasonably necessary or appropriate" language-gives OSHA discretion to do with this evidence as it chooses. Under FIFRA, by contrast, an agency that fails to consider ancillary risks would probably be violating the statute, at least on a showing that the ancillary risks are real and the costs of investigation are not excessive. 
Consider in this regard the principal case involving the issue of health-health tradeoffs, Competitive Enterprise Institute v NHTSA ("CE')."4 NHTSA establishes fuel economy standards; in doing so, NHTSA is required to consider the issue of "feasibility." In deciding the question of feasibility, NHTSA has taken account of passenger safety, including risks created by regulation, and while there is a possible statutory issue here,"5 everyone in CEI accepted NRTSA's views on this point. The question in the case was whether NHTSA acted lawfully in refusing to relax its fuel economy standards for certain model years. Automobile companies urged that relaxation was required in order to save lives-because the existing standards would lead to "downsizing" and hence to smaller and more dangerous vehicles-and they presented strong evidence to this effect. 
The agency responded that this evidence was unconvincing and that "domestic manufacturers should be able to improve their fuel economy in the future by... technological means, without outsourcing their larger cars, without further downsizing or mix shifts toward smaller cars, and without sacrificing acceleration or performance."" 6 The court held that this explanation was inadequate. The agency failed to claim or show that manufacturers would actually fail to downsize their cars. In any case downsizing would be costly and that "cost would translate into higher prices for large cars (as well as small), thereby pressuring consumers to retain their old cars and make the associated sacrifice in safety. 14 956 F2d 321 (DC Cir 1992).

It is not clear that this provision allows NHTSA to consider safety effects as part of its judgment about feasibility.

On remand, the agency offered a somewhat better explanation. NHTSA pointed to what it saw as the absence of clear indications that fuel economy standards had caused any manufacturer to price consumers out of the market for larger, safer cars. NHTSA referred as well to an absence of manufacturer claims about the specific design standards that would result from the standards. The court found this explanation sufficient."' In doing so, it applied a highly deferential standard of review. 
In light of the record, however, and the predictable pressures on an agency like NHTSA, the result in the case might well be questioned. NHTSA may well suffer from a form of "tunnel vision," especially in dealing with fuel economy standards, for which there is a powerful constituency."' The interests that call for attention to ancillary safety risks are typically poorly organized, and when the claims come from the automobile manufacturers, NHTSA may be too ready to distrust them. To say this is not to say that NHTSA should be required to relax its fuel economy standards. But it is to say that a demonstration of the sort made by the automobile manufacturers might well serve as a kind of warning signal to the court, requiring a solid response from the agency. In CEI, the agency's response could not qualify as solid, as the court itself, while affirming the agency, seemed to suggest. 
A promising model for the future is provided by an important court of appeals decision holding that under a statute that required open-ended balancing of relevant factors, an agency was required to ask whether the risks that would substitute for asbestos would lead to even greater risks.'2 Thus the court emphasized that asbestos was the safest material for brake linings and that safe substitutes might not be found in other areas as well.12 
The point I am making here might well be generalized. Agencies ought to be required to show that they are doing more '7 Id at 325 (citation omitted).

A. Congress 
In its present form, Congress is ill equipped to consider the problem of health-health tradeoffs. Its committee structure ensures a high degree of fragmentation and does not allow for deliberation on such tradeoffs. On the contrary, that structure makes ancillary risks difficult to evaluate or, much worse, to see. Often ancillary risks are thought to be subject to the jurisdiction of another committee, which means, in practice, that coordination is extremely difficult. In these circumstances, I offer two simple suggestions for legislative reform. 
First, Congress should create a new legislative committee entrusted specifically with the power to assess aggregate risk levels, to compare risks, and to initiate revision of statutes that increase net risks. This committee should have the authority to introduce corrective legislation when a statute, or agency action under a statute, has been shown to increase aggregate risks. Congress's current efforts in this regard are far too modest. Speaker Gingrich's introduction of a regular "Corrections Day"' may provide some modest deterrence and offer protection against abuses, but it is far too irregular to provide the sort of coordination that is needed. No institution in Congress is in a position to ensure against selective attention in lawmaking; a new committee could help solve this problem.

' "Corrections Day" was suggested by Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich as a separate calendar to "correct" ambiguous, arbitrary, or ludicrous laws and regulations. See Establishing a Corrections Calendar in the House of Representatives, H Res 168, 104th Cong, 1st Sess (June 16, 1995), in 141 Cong Rec H6104-16 (June 20, 1995).

Procedure Act. Notably, recent initiatives designed to require cost-benefit balancing say almost nothing about this problem. The principal exception is a House bill introduced in 1995, which contains a subsection entitled "substitution risks." This subsection says that "[e]ach significant risk assessment or risk characterization document shall include a statement of any significant substitution risks to human health, where information on such risks has been provided to the agency." ' 
But this is a strikingly modest initiative. It does not require agencies to investigate ancillary risks on their own. Nor does it say that agencies may not proceed unless the regulation yields netbenefits. I suggest instead a new amendment to the Administrative Procedure Act: 'Agencies shall ensure, to the extent feasible, that regulations do not create countervailing risks that are greaterthan those of the regulated risk." A modest forerunner of this idea can be found in the "clean fuels" provision of the Clean Air Act, which says that the Administrator of the EPA may not prohibit the use of a fuel or fuel additive "unless he finds... that in his judgment such prohibition will not cause the use of any other fuel or fuel additive which will produce emissions which will endanger the public health or welfare to the same or greater degree than the use of the fuel or fuel additive proposed to be prohibited." This idea should be generalized. The words "to the extent feasible" are necessary because some investigations are too costly and speculative to be worthwhile. 
B. Executive Branch 
OIRA has been entrusted with the power to coordinate regulatory policy and to ensure reasonable priority setting.2 In the Clinton administration, OIRA appears to have become an advisory body, more limited in its power than it was in the Bush and Reagan administrations. In view of the absence of good priority setting, and the enormous room for saving costs and increasing regulatory benefits, this is highly unfortunate.

OIRA should see, as one of its central assignments, the task of overcoming governmental tunnel vision, by ensuring that aggregate risks are reduced and that agency focus on particular risks does not mean that ancillary risks are ignored or increased. This is a more modest and particularized version of Justice Breyer's larger suggestion that OIRA should have a power to set priorities by diverting resources from smaller problems to larger ones.' It also fits with the emerging interest in "common sense government."' No body in government is now entrusted with the authority of ensuring that risk regulation is managed so as to ensure global rationality and coherence. OIRA is well situated to take on that role, at least by attending to the possibility that regulation of some risks may make risk levels higher on balance. 130 
CONCLUSION 
On the fiftieth anniversary of the Administrative Procedure Act, it would be far too simple to say that the administrative state has been a failure. In many ways, it has been a substantial success. Risks to safety and health are much lower than they have been in the past, partly because of regulatory safeguards.'3' But current programs are far more costly, and far less effective, than they should be. Reforms to the APA, as that Act was originally envisaged, would be much too modest to provide adequate correctives. Existing difficulties cannot be solved by weakening or intensifying standards of judicial review, or by increasing or decreasing the procedures that are required before agencies undertake regulatory action. 
As the twenty-first century approaches, it is especially important to design regulatory institutions that counteract the identifiable problems of modern regulation. These problems usually stem from selective attention in the form of inadequate concern for setting priorities, for providing good incentives, and for minimizing harmful side-effects. The relevant reforms would

Among the principal side-effects, not well addressed in current proposals or existing law, is the increased risk sometimes produced by risk regulation. Selective attention of this kind is a natural outcome of the cognitive limitations of human beings; sometimes it is the product of self-conscious efforts by well organized private groups. In any case, selective attention can easily be exploited by such groups intent on redistributing resources in their favor. This is a significant problem, and through some simple steps, something can be done about it. 
I have emphasized that tradeoffs among risks ought not to be based on a unitary metric, for reasons of both law and basic principle. Lives are not commensurable with costs; lives are not even commensurable with lives. The context in which life is put at risk matters a great deal. But tradeoffs must nonetheless be made. The problem is that public institutions do not undertake this task in a self-conscious manner. New institutions should be designed so as to overcome the cognitive problems and to ensure that the relevant tradeoffs are made in a way that entails more knowledge and more deliberation. Above all, institutions should be created to ensure that risk reduction is pursued more frequently than risk redistribution. To accomplish this task, it is necessary to take steps to limit the effects of myopia, selective attention, and interest-group influence in the regulatory process. 
I have suggested several possible steps. Under existing law, agencies should often be understood to have the authority to engage in health-health tradeoffs, and they should exercise that authority far more often than they now do. Courts should play a modest but catalytic role in encouraging agencies to increase aggregate risk reduction. They should do so, above all, by adopting an interpretive principle authorizing agencies to perform health-health analysis unless Congress has expressly forbidden them from so doing. Congress should create a new committee designed to rank risks and monitor risk regulation for overall coherence; it should also add to existing legislation a general requirement that agencies consider all risks, to the extent that this is feasible. Finally, OIRA (or some similar institution) should undertake the process of scrutinizing risk regulation to ensure that agency action does not suffer from the kinds of tunnel vi" See S 343 and HR 9, discussed in Sunstein, 48 Stan L Rev at 269-86 (cited in note 
In this Essay, I make a simple and somewhat impressionistic argument. I start with the suggestion that the issue of affirmative action should be settled democratically, not judicially. Certainly the Supreme Court should not invalidate most race-conscious remedial programs. But until recently, there has been little or no sustained democratic deliberation on the issue. The citizenry's ambivalence about-or hostility toward-affirmative action has been expressed mostly in private and not in public arenas. The enormous diversity of affirmative action programs, not to mention the separable justifications for and variable efficacy of each program, has not received much public attention. Some programs work well; some do not; and neither empirical data nor public judgments about their content and value have been reflected in program design. 
In these circumstances, the Supreme Court's apparently odd behavior-its meandering course, its refusal to issue rules-in the affirmative action context might be defended as performing a valuable catalytic function. The Court's willingness to hear a number of affirmative action cases, and its complex, rule-free, highly casuistical' opinions, have had the salutary consequence of helping to stimulate public processes and directing the citizenry toward open discussion of underlying questions of policy and principle. In these ways, the Court's route has been far preferable to the most obvious alternatives: validation or invalidation of most affirmative action programs pursuant to clear doctrinal categories.

by reference to rules or theories. See generallyALBERT R. JONSEN AND STEPHEN E. TOULMIN, THE ABUSE OF CASUISTRY (1988). 
That, in a nutshell, is the argument to follow.2 I do not claim that the Court has always been self-conscious about the virtues of casuistry thus described. But if the point is correct, it bears a great deal on the relations between the Court and a well-functioning system of political deliberation. It connects, for example, to current debates about the relationship between the Constitution and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; here too, the Court might use a casuistical method to spur public discussion. There are, however, serious questions about whether current public processes are sufficiently deliberative, especially in the area of affirmative action. 
People often think one thing but say another, because of the effects of social pressures and social norms on what can be said in public? For example, in most contemporary American circles, a strong social stigma against anti-Semitic statements exists; people who think anti-Semitic things are unlikely to make such statements on television or in a public debate. In many groups where religious convictions are both deep and widespread, people cannot confess their uncertainty about whether God exists; they may attend church regularly despite their doubts on that score. In other places, people cannot acknowledge that they are deeply religious; in such places, social norms punish public declarations of religious convictions The general point is simple: social norms drive a wedge between public statements and private beliefs, hopes, and convictions. 
From this point, it emerges that "political correctness" is no isolated phenomenon limited to left-leaning intellectuals. It is a pervasive fact of social life. It appears whenever prevailing norms discourage people from taking issue with a widely held social belief. Those interested in democratic politics should notice the omnipresent role of public constraints on public statements. 
Is the existence of such constraints something to be lamented? No simple answer would make sense. Sometimes, by imposing sanctions on 1996] vicious or invidious judgments, social norms have a healthy "laundering effect."5 The existence of social sanctions can make people embarrassed about those judgments and eventually make them recede or even disappear. If "[h]ypocrisy is the homage that vice pays to virtue,"6 then social norms can identify both vice and virtue as such, and enable citizens to tell which is which. Hypocrisy can therefore have valuable social uses. It has a civilizing effect It can produce justice by making unjust behavior seem vicious or otherwise unacceptable. , 
On the other hand, social norms of the kind I am discussing can cause damage in two different ways. First, they may prevent people from offering arguments that are productive, reasonable, or even right. If prevailing norms are invidious or rooted in confusion, they may even perpetuate invidious or confused practices. Consider the many areas in the world where social norms strongly discourage advocacy of sex equality;' many women who indicate their belief in equality run enormous risks. Second, social norms may discourage the expression of doubt, even when doubt exists and when debate is, partly for that very reason, desirable and potentially productive. In that way, prevailing norms can damage processes of public deliberation. Even if prevailing norms are not invidious on their merits-even if they reflect clear thinking or hard won wisdom-their effects can be pernicious when they impair public deliberation. In a well-functioning democracy, facts and options are clarified through doubt, and people have a sense of what their fellow citizens think.. 
Of course, a certain suppression of issues and opinions stems from practical necessities. Not everything can be discussed at once. At any time, many things must be taken for granted. Some things are properly taken as so obvious that they "go without saying." But in many areas, one can safely say that democratic processes would be better if public debate focused on what really concerns people. 
From the standpoint of both law and democratic theory, a great deal needs to be done on this important topic. We do not know the extent to which actual private judgments are not expressed publicly, even when they are quite widespread, and when the reason for silence is that social norms impose sanctions on the public expression of those judgments. It is therefore important to take account of possible disparities between what is said and what is thought. It is also important to know how wide such disparities are, whether the disparities reflect biases, and whether some social institutions or practices facilitate or inhibit open discussion. 
II 
THE SUPREME COURT AS CATALYST 
It seems obvious to say that when the Supreme Court faces a constitutional attack on a law, it has three basic options: it might uphold the law, it might invalidate the law, or it might refuse to address the issue by denying certiorari or by taking advantage of various avoidance strategies. 
A detailed literature discusses the third and least obvious of these options.'0 On a familiar view, the Court should often permit issues to "percolate" in lower courts and in the nation as a whole. Through this route, it can allow many forms of legal and political discussion and debate; in that way, the Court avoids premature judicial foreclosure of hard questions. The Court might take this route for practical reasons or for reasons of principle. Perhaps a firm judicial resolution would be poorly received by the community." Surely this point bears on possible judicial foreclosure of affirmative action programs, say, twenty-five years ago. Perhaps a judicial resolution would disserve the very cause that the Court is seeking to promote. This point has been vigorously urged in the context of abortion, where (it is said) the Court's early judicial decision in Roe v. Wade2 helped undermine the movement for sex equality. 3 Certainly judicial decisions can have unintended social consequences, and this practical point argues in favor of judicial caution. The Court might also avoid premature foreclosure because of its own humility. The Court might lack relevant information and wait to see how a certain practice works out in reality. Or the Court might believe that certain issues are difficult from the standpoint of (legally relevant) morality and therefore, in principle, it is important to ensure that a good deal of public deliberation occurs before the Court acts. 
These are important points, and as we will see they bear a great deal on the issues raised by affirmative action. But the Court actually has a (discussing the Supreme Court's practice to withhold exercise ofpower of judical review). 
"constrained" by various social and cultural conditions, including public opinion). 

the political efficacy of pro-choice forces"). fourth option: it can issue a highly casuistical decision, one that resolves little beyond the single case, but that operates as a catalyst for public discussion. By assuming jurisdiction, by offering a ruling, but by issuing a ruling that is case-specific and along crucial dimensions not authoritative for the future, it can call public attention to a problem without foreclosing public judgment. This fourth option is especially appropriate when the Court is uncertain about whether general rules would be satisfactory, and when it believes that differences of fact and content are highly relevant to constitutional outcomes. 
There is, of course, a large debate within the Court and within the scholarly community about the virtues of case-by-case particularism. 14 Defenders of particularism often speak of the need to proceed cautiously in the midst of ignorance about issues not before the Court. 15 But particularism also has a democratic function, and this is so in two different ways. Judicial particularists can promote democratic virtues of participation and responsiveness, by ensuring that people are not foreclosed by rulings involving previous litigants who have somewhat different complaints. The process of judicial particularism allows each person to have a day in court, invoking the distinctive features of his or her case. 6 But there is an independent point. Particularist decisions allow people, through democratic processes, to continue to debate issues, secure in the knowledge that courts have not attempted to have a final say. In this respect, case-specific judgments operate as a kind of "remand" to the public for further proceedings, at least in the sense that they do not foreclose those proceedings and may even spur them through the visibility of court decisions. 
In administrative law, a remand to the agency for further proceedings is an exceedingly common phenomenon.17 In the remand, the agency is permitted to do as it originally did, but it must offer a new and better justification. The court's decision is case-specific; it can easily be "distinguished" by a resourceful administrator, even on the same set of facts. Much debate exists over whether this process generally tends to work out well. 8 But when it does, the remand promotes better public deliberation by drawing attention to difficulties that had not yet received adequate attention, and by helping to produce better processes of deliberation for the future."' 
Much of constitutional law has a structure similar to the administrative law remand. 0 Sometimes the Court effectively "remands" issues for fresh deliberation.2 Many of the modem privacy cases involving sexual autonomy can be understood accordingly.' In these cases, the state defended laws restricting availability of contraception by reference to the goal of preventing premarital or extramarital activity. The Court did not deny that the state has a legitimate interest in preventing nonmarital sexual activity. We do not say that a law directly punishing such activity is unconstitutional. But, the state may not attempt to promote the underlying interest through the indirect means of preventing contraception. If the state is genuinely interested in preventing nonmarital sexual relations, it must pursue that policy in a way that receives meaningful democratic scrutiny and reflects actual democratic approval of the underlying judgment of policy and principle-through the criminal sanction. The more indirect and discriminatory route of preventing contraception is an unacceptable means of pursuing the relevant end. Because of its indirection, a ban on contraceptives does not accurately reflect a democratic judgment against extramarital relations. In fact, no such judgment followed the Court's cases because the public was unwilling to use the criminal sanction to punish extramarital relations directly.

This is a controversial account of the privacy cases. But it helps make sense of rulings that are otherwise very puzzling. And at the very least, it suggests the possibility of a judicial role in catalyzing public debate through narrow rulings designed to focus public attention on the more fundamental questions.

THE AFFRMATIVE ACTION MUDDLE 
It is easy to be skeptical about the Supreme Court's affirmative action cases. From the standpoint of the rule of law, the cases are truly a mess. This was so from the very start. In Regents of the University of Californiav. Bakke,' the Court was badly divided and could not produce a majority opinion. Of course, the often-criticized "rule" of the case was that universities may use race "as a factor" in admissions, but may not create quotas.' While this rule has played a crucial role in American society and American debate, it represented the view of Justice Powell alone. The other eight participating justices explicitly rejected that rule. Ironically, the case stands for a proposition that only one justice thought sensible. 
Bakke was not an auspicious beginning for those seeking clear rules. The Court's second affirmative action case, Fullilove v. Klutznick, compounded the problem.'s In that case, no majority spoke for the Court, no standard of review was selected for affirmative action cases, and by the plurality's own admission, its decision was highly dependent on the facts of the particular case.' In another case with slightly different facts, the outcome might be different. 27 Remarkably, during the next nine years, the Court's decisions developed no clear standard of review and seemed to turn not on rules, but instead on a large set of factors: -whether official findings of past discrimination had been made;' -whether the relevant program was rigid or flexible;29 -whether the relevant program operated as a quota; 0

had excluded an identifiable minority group that had been the victim of a degree of disadvantage and discrimination equal to or greater than that suffered by the groups encompassed in the program). 
of past discrimination by the government department involved before racial classifications can be used to remedy discrimination). 

-whether the relevant program had been issued by Congress, by another politically accountable body, by a court, or by some other institution;3 -whether innocent victims were injured, and if so in a severe way;32 -and more.33 The use of these numerous factors led to surprising decisions in particular cases, and outcomes were hard to predict in advance. Notably, some of these factors relate to the nature of the deliberative process itself. The relevant cases received a good deal of public attention, but the constitutional position of affirmative action programs remained quite obscure 4 
It was not until 1989 that the Court finally settled on a standard of review. In City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 35 a plurality of the Court held that affirmative action programs would be subject to "strict scrutiny," at least if they had not been enacted by the federal government3. 6 But even while announcing a standard of review, it did so in such a way as to leave the law exceptionally obscure, and to leave the many decisions that preceded Croson in an uncertain state.37 Hence, Croson did not reject the Court's casuistical approach to affirmative action. And in Adarand Constructors Inc. v. Pena,31 when the Court finally announced that the same standard of review applied to the nation 1996] as to the states,39 it went out of its way to make clear that the standard would not lead to automatic invalidation, that outcomes would turn on particular facts,' and thus that we could not foresee certain results in future cases. 
As a result, there is still--eighteen years and numerous Supreme Court cases after Bakke-a high degree of uncertainty about the law governing affirmative action. The public reaction to Adarand shows that a great deal of doubt about whether affirmative action is constitutionally permissible still remains.41 Now, as before, the validity of an affirmative action program greatly depends on the particular case. 
What has the Court achieved? Perhaps the Court has succeeded in invalidating the most indefensible affirmative action plans and in upholding the most legitimate. This would certainly be the optimist's view.42 But if we step back a bit, we might conclude that the Court has helped keep the nation's eye on the affirmative action issue--on the questions of policy and principle that lie behind the debate-while at the same time failing to preempt processes of public discussion and debate. Above all, the Court has done this because it has decided a large number of cases, but proceeded in a highly particularistic manner.

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND PUBLIC DEBATE 
It seems reasonable to think that the question of affirmative action should be settled democratically, not judicially. Despite frequent prot39. Id. at 2117 (holding that all government-established racial classifications must be analyzed under the strict scrutiny standard of review). 
we wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is 'strict in theory, but fatal in fact.' The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified from acting in response to it.... When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such action is within constitutional constraints if it satisfies the 'narrow tailoring' test this Court has set out in previous cases.

Broadcasting Inc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547 (1990), is probably the least defensible, but the Court actually upheld it. The Court said that the minority set-aside in the broadcasting area could be defended as a way of ensuring that the minority community would receive broadcasting of its choice. Id. But-and this is a central point--there was no requirement that minority-owned stations provide broadcasting for minority communities. The reason that there was no such requirement was that it would, on the conventional view, violate the First Amendment. Thus, the Court upheld the minority set-aside as a proxy (admittedly a very crude one) for an end that was generally believed unconstitutional. estations to the contrary,43 the Constitution imposes no clear textual ban on affirmative action. In fact, the textual arguments are laughably inadequate. To be sure, the Constitution calls for "equal" protection of the laws; but this point is uninformative on the validity of affirmative action.' The term "equal" cannot possibly mean "the same," if "the same" is intended to suggest a ban on all classification. By their nature, laws classify. Even the law of equal protection classifies. Thus, it is no offense to the Equal Protection Clause if courts scrutinize sex-based classifications more skeptically than they scrutinize age-based classifications--even though this difference does not treat people "the same." The question is what the word "equal" requires in this context. Dictionaries are unhelpful here. The only way to make progress is to go outside of the text; we must look there to find possible understandings of the Constitution's equality principle. 
Nor is it helpful to say that the Constitution speaks of "any person" rather than of groups." The Supreme Court, together with many scholars, appears to think that the reference to "any person" means that the clause speaks of individuals rather than of groups, and that this point counts against affirmative action.46 This claim contains some truth, but it is misleading. To be sure, "any person" may complain that a classification is constitutionally unacceptable. But on what grounds can "any person" seek special judicial assistance? Under the Equal Protection Clause, all claims of unconstitutionaldiscriminationare necessarily based on complaints about treatment that singles out a characteristic shared by a group. A glance at the cases, or at any imaginable set of cases, shows that anyone who complains of unconstitutional discrimination is necessarily complaining about the government's use, for purposes of classification, of some characteristic that is shared by some number of group members. The question is whether the government's use of that shared characteristic is disfavored from the constitutional point of view. There is no serious question about whether the characteristics of which "any person" may complain are shared characteristics; of course they are. In this sense, claims of unconstitutional discrimination are always group-based claims, even if they are made by ''any person." 
THE PEOPLE 58-61 (1988); RICHARD A. EPSTEIN, FORBIDDEN GROUNDs: THE CASE AGAINST EMPLOYMENT DISCRIrMtNATION LAWS 395-437 (1992). 

J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469,493 (1989) (O'Connor, J.) (plurality opinion); Regents of the Univ. of Calif. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 289-90 (Powell, J.) (1978); see also EPSTEIN, supra note 43, at 
For example, suppose that Jones has been denied a government job. As a "person," she has a right to make a complaint under the Equal Protection Clause. But everything depends on the characteristic on which government has allegedly seized. For Jones to claim heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, she has to say something about the classification that the government has used; and she must say that the classification treats her, as a member of a certain group, in a "suspect" way. Thus she has a claim to careful scrutiny of laws disadvantaging her if those laws classify on the basis of sex. But if she invokes another characteristic, she has no such claim. The same plaintiff Jones has no right to heightened judicial scrutiny if those laws classify on the basis of age.47 She is thus entitled to a degree of scrutiny corresponding to the basis of the classification of which she complains. 
In short, almost all classifications involve "groups." The issue is whether heightened scrutiny represents the appropriate standard of review for the particular classification that the government has used. The fact that the Constitution refers to "any person" is utterly uninformative regarding whether any particular foundation for classification should, or does, meet heightened judicial scrutiny. The Court's use of the constitutional text as a justification for heightened scrutiny is bad formalism-the pretense that the legal text resolves the question when the judgment must actually be based on other grounds. 
If the text of the Constitution does not ban affirmative action, what of the Constitution's history? It might be tempting to say that it is a lesson of the Civil War that all racial classifications are unacceptable. But the history shows no such particular understanding on the part of those who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment. On the contrary, it tends to suggest that affirmative action policies were regarded as legitimate. The Reconstruction Congress that approved the Fourteenth Amendment concurrently enacted a number of race-specific programs for AfricanAmericans." A substantial debate about whether such programs were legitimate occurred, and the people who controlled Congress after the Civil War concluded that they were. No evidence exists in the Fourteenth Amendment ratification debates that all race-conscious programs would be impermissible.49 
History need not be decisive. Perhaps a moral argument justifies the Court in reading the text to ban affirmative action. But no clear moral argument requires courts to treat affirmative action policies with great skepticism. Many critics of affirmative action claim that the moral argument lay at the heart of the work of Martin Luther King, Jr., and others in the civil rights movements of the 1960s; ยฐ but this is an historical error. Asked in 1965 whether it was "fair to request a multibilliondollar program of preferential treatment for the Negro, or for any other minority group," King flatly replied, "I do indeed."51 In 1966, King wrote, 
It is impossible to create a formula for the future which does not take into account that our society has been doing something special againstthe Negro for hundreds of years. How then can he be absorbed into the mainstream of American life if we do not do something special for him now, in order to balance the equation and equip him to compete on a just and equal basis?"" In fact, King's 1964 book, Why We Can't Wait, criticized the idea that once African Americans had been granted simple equality before the law, no further action should be taken. He wrote, 
On the surface, this appears reasonable, but it is not realistic. For it is obvious that if a man is entered at the starting line in a race three hundred years after another man, the first would have to perform some impossible feat in order to catch up with his fellow runner.53 
The views of Martin Luther King, Jr., need not be decisive. Perhaps a moral principle of color-blindness deserves constitutional recognition; certainly this is so if it is the only intelligible principle behind the constitutional concern for racial equality. But we can identify an alternative moral principle, one that has actually been responsible for most of the movement for racial change in America, both during the Civil War and thereafter. In the area of race, a large target of the Civil War Amendments was the preexisting system of racial caste: a system that turned the highly visible and morally irrelevant characteristic of race into a systemic basis for second-class citizenship.' The Fourteenth Amendment is best conceived of as opposing that caste system.5 5 And if this represents the best conception of the Fourteenth Amendment, then there is nothing fundamentally illegitimate about affirmative action programs. 56 Such programs are designed to overcome caste-like features of 1996] existing practice. This does not mean that they are a good idea, as they may not have this effect. It may be that they are bad on grounds of policy and should be rejected in democratic and administrative arenas. But that possibility does not make them constitutionally objectionable. 
In fact, the Supreme Court has yet to provide a clear explanation of the principle that requires affirmative action programs to be treated so skeptically.Y Most of its argument depends on a false claim of symmetry: if discrimination against African Americans is presumptively forbidden, how can discrimination against whites be presumptively legitimate? 8 This question is anything but rhetorical. It is no better than the question, if discrimination on the basis of sex is presumed illegitimate, how can the same not be true for discrimination on the basis of age? In fact, the anticaste principle helps provide an answer to both questions, and that answer suggests that different forms of discrimination are utterly different. To be sure, the Court has referred to a set of legitimate concerns about affirmative action policies: the social divisiveness of affirmative action, the ordinary moral irrelevance of race, the fact that race is not chosen voluntarily, and the possibility that affirmative action programs will stigmatize their intended beneficiaries. But none of these points supports a convincing constitutional complaint about affirmative action.59 Many things that government does are divisive, yet they are not unconstitutional for that reason. Many characteristics that are morally irrelevant, and that are not voluntarily chosen, are used by government as classifying devices; consider height, strength, and intelligence. Affrmnative action programs may well stigmatize their intended beneficiaries. But the same is plausibly true for programs that benefit children of alumni or people from underrepresented regions, and those programs are not, because of their stigmatizing effects, unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
Affirmative Action and the PublicInterest, 1995 Sup. Cr. REv. 1. Undoubtedly, interest-group power does underlie some affirmative action programs. But why should this form of interest-group victory receive careful judicial scrutiny, while other forms do not? 
Occasionally, the cases also suggest that racial classifications produce social division. See, e.g., City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989) (O'Connor, J.) (plurality opinion); Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 545 (1980) (Stevens, J., dissenting). This may well be true. But an absence of affirmative action programs would also produce social division. In any case, many government programs appear to promote social division, and they are not constitutionally suspect for that reason. Some examples include veterans' preference laws, laws supporting public education, as well as laws supporting art and culture. 
offers no argument against preferential treatment even though preferential treatment is one of the book's central targets. 

These remarks certainly do not mean that affirmative action programs are a good idea. The range of such programs is very wide, and to make a judgment on them, it is important to have a sense of their variety and of their consequences. Such programs include relatively uncontroversial efforts to increase the pool of applicants by ensuring that the candidates are diverse; these efforts are certainly race-conscious, but at the stage of recruitment rather than actual appointment. It is hard to see why such efforts are objectionable. Other affirmative action programs include race as a factor among many others. Still other programs include rigid quota systems as well. Some programs give a minor boost to highly qualified candidates, and some allow people entry into programs for which they are ill-suited. Evaluation of such programs should depend partly on their content and their consequences, and the term "affirmative action programs" is far too imprecise to speak adequately on that score. Above all, We need to know how such programs are operating in the real world. Undoubtedly, many affirmative action programs are successful and perceived as such. 
It is striking but true that until the very recent past, the nation had yet to have a sustained discussion about the legitimacy and variety of affirmative action programs and of possible alternatives.' When Congress adopted the 1964 Civil Rights Act, discrimination against African Americans was of course the central focus of the debate.6' Affirmative action programs were in an embryonic state and did not receive much, if any, consideration.62 The first important affirmative action program was actually adopted by Executive Order.63 The proliferation of such programs at the national, state, and local levels has proceeded without sustained attention to the underlying issues of principle and policy. Whatever one thinks about the legitimacy of affirmative action, this lack of deliberation is quite disturbing.' 
1996] 
In fact, it is plausible to think that some of the public backlash against affirmative action is attributable to the perception that the relevant programs have never been debated and defended publicly. It is not at all true to say, as many do, that affirmative action programs are a creation of federal courts;' many such programs have their origins in private decisions or in decisions of politically accountable bodies. But the widespread perception that affirmative action programs are courtgenerated is illuminating insofar as it suggests a belief that such programs have not been ratified publicly. 
We are now in a position to discuss the possible catalytic role of the Supreme Court insofar as that role bears on the affirmative action debate. Suppose that it is agreed that the issue of affirmative action should be decided democratically rather than judicially-but suppose, too, that institutions are operating in such a way as to ensure that any public decisions are taken in an unaccountable way, and are not really a product of democratic judgments. The Supreme Court's meandering, casuistical, rule-free path may well be a salutary way of signaling the existence of large questions of policy and principle, at least with constitutional dimensions, when those questions would otherwise receive far less attention than they deserve. Hence, the participants in Supreme Court cases have become familiar "characters" in the national debate, helping to frame discussion: people like Bakke," Weber,6 7 Johnson,68 minority construction contractors, 9 and others. 
Judicial signaling is especially important in a context where social norms may have an adverse effect on open public discussion. Suppose that a policy persists not because people are in favor of it, but because social norms prevent people from voicing their complaints publicly. Suppose too that these complaints are widespread. If this is so, 70 there is a democratic problem that requires attention. At least as a general rule, something should be done to ensure that the issue receives public consideration. Private actors can help to remedy the situation. We might describe as "norm entrepreneurs" those people who try to activate private beliefs and judgments in favor of a shift in existing social norms. But official institutions can play a role as well. In particular, the Supreme Court can signal the existence of hard questions of political morality and public policy, by taking cases, drawing public attention to the underlying questions, and refusing to issue authoritative pronouncements. And if we examine the Court's practice in the area of affirmative action, we can see that the Court has operated in precisely this way. It has helped keep the affirmative action issue in the public domain without foreclosing public deliberation. In this way, the Court has served a valuable catalytic function. 
I do not claim that the Court has been self-conscious about its role. But some of the justices, especially Justices O'Connor and Powell, have undoubtedly been aware of the difficulty and variety of the affirmative action problem and have chosen a casuistical approach for this reason. Nor do I claim that the current public interest in affirmative action owes its origin to Supreme Court decisions. There are undoubtedly a wide range of factors that could be said to have played a catalytic role. All I contend is that the Court's decisions have been among the factors that have both kept affirmative action in the public eye and helped focus the public on issues of principle and policy. And to the extent that those effects have been salutary, the Court's practice here bears on other meandering paths in the past, 3 and also on future practices, perhaps in the area of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, where a degree of casuistry also makes a good deal of sense.74 
I cannot offer here a full discussion of when casuistry in the interest of public deliberation is a desirable strategy for the Court,75 but a few brief remarks may be helpful. The casuistical approach makes most sense when the Court is uncertain or divided about whether any broad rule is constitutionally sound. It follows that in the affirmative action context, the Court's approach is more attractive to those who are unsure about the constitutional status of affirmative action. For those who believe that it is per se invalid, or clearly acceptable in all circumstances, 1996] judicial casuistry would be harder to defend. Casuistry will seem most sensible to those who believe that the relevant outcome should turn on particular facts. In the affirmative action context, we might think that a rigid quota system is worse than "race as a factor," or that universities have special reasons to engage in race-conscious programs. 
Equally important, the argument for casuistry, as a catalytic approach, is strengthened by a judgment that judicial decisions will in fact spur, or at least be a healthy part of, ongoing processes of public deliberation. The argument becomes even stronger if those processes at least have the potential to function well. If this is so, judicial casuistry may promote, rather than undermine, the system of democratic deliberation. If, on the other hand, public deliberation is unlikely in any event, or likely to operate very badly, a more rule-bound approach to the Constitution would be better. Obviously there are empirical issues here that I have not resolved. 
On these grounds, we can see how the Court's casuistical decisions, defended in the way I have here, might best be criticized. Perhaps the Constitution is sensibly interpreted to ban all affirmative action programs (though I have suggested that this would be a most adventurous reading). Perhaps the Constitution is best understood not to draw such programs into question at all. Or perhaps democratic processes have been working very well without the Court, and the Court's decisions have been marginally relevant, or have even helped to facilitate distortions of democratic deliberation. I do not believe this judgment could be supported, but it suggests the direction in which a challenge to the Court's approach might move. It suggests, too, how judicial casuistry might be evaluated in the context of such issues as discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. I believe, for example, that most such discrimination is unacceptable under the Equal Protection Clause. But it may very well make sense for the Court to proceed slowly, cautiously, and in a case-specific way, because of the variety of possible settings, the practical need to build on democratic judgments, and the value of judicial humility in the face of so controversial a public issue, one that is now receiving considerable public attention.76 
VI AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, DELIBERATIVE GOVERNMENT, AND 
THE REFERENDUM 
The suggestion that the Court has helped catalyze public debate should not by any means be taken as a claim that with respect to affirmative action, the democratic process has been or is now working well. With "norm cascades"-large shifts in current norms-there is a risk that outcomes will be based on sensationalistic anecdotes, on factual misperceptions, or, worse, on simple racism and hatred. Undoubtedly, objections to affirmative action programs are often well-motivated; it would be ludicrous to think that such objections are necessarily rooted in racial prejudice. But appeals to racism, usually tacit, are a large part of the debate. Some people might think that affirmative action is an unpromising area for public deliberation precisely because of the likelihood that racist motivations will be at work. If this is an unpromising area for public deliberation, the argument for a catalytic effort from the Court is of course weakened, and judges might attempt to resolve the problem on other grounds. 
The relevant risks are especially severe in the context of a referendum, which bypasses ordinary filters of political representation and hence raises special risks.n Referenda may well be based on inadequate information and on popular passions that are insufficiently influenced by reason-giving and understanding of context. 7' This was of course a relevant concern in the framing period.79 
Much national attention is now focused on a referendum proposal in California designed to eliminate preferential treatment based on race.8" Political processes in California on this issue do not appear to be deliberative. The American system is one of representative rather than direct democracy, partly because of a judgment that political deliberation can be best promoted through a representative system.8' If judicial decisions stimulate poorly functioning referendum processes, little will be gained. 
In the context of affirmative action in particular, there is a danger that referendum outcomes will not be based on a careful assessment of facts and values, but instead on crude "we-they" thinking. This is a 1996] danger in the context of race. It is not my purpose here to evaluate that risk. But if a catalytic role from the Court serves to intensify poorly functioning majoritarian processes, that role may be nothing to celebrate. Both exercises of statesmanship and institutional correctivesdisplacing the referendum process with more insulated bodies-may be in order. Hence, it is appropriate to assemble politically insulated groups to try to compile information about the actual effects of affirmative action programs.83 
Unfortunately, it is unclear whether the Supreme Court can do a great deal to make things better. Some people have suggested that the Court might review the outcomes of referenda with an unusually high degree of skepticism.' There is some sense in this suggestion. An approach of this kind can find structural support in the Constitution, which is rooted in faith in representation, and in the Constitution's most fundamental underlying concerns. It is plausible to say that the Court should be mildly more receptive to a constitutional challenge when legislation has come through referenda. But no provision of the Constitution specifically authorizes judges to regard the outcomes of referenda as less legitimate than the outcomes of representative processes, and in any case it is not, under current law, easy to see how someone might challenge a ban on affirmative action on these constitutional grounds.85 
CONCLUSION 
In this essay, I have tried to connect two ideas. The first involves the disjunction between private beliefs and public statements-a disjunction that stems from social norms that can discourage honest public argument about public issues and in that way undermine values that animate the First Amendment itself. The second involves the catalytic animate the First Amendment itself. The second involves the catalytic role of the Supreme Court. This role is ordinarily thought to involve three principal powers: validating or invalidating laws, and refusing to hear cases. But the Court has a fourth power-the authority to issue highly casuistical rulings that do not settle much, but that operate as a kind of "remand" to the public, alerting people to the existence of hard issues of principle and policy. In the affirmative action context, the Court, whether or not intentionally, has done precisely this. It has said little that is authoritative. It has, however, helped trigger public debate, with, perhaps, an understanding on the part of some of the Justices that until recently, the debate was neither broadly inclusive nor properly deliberative-and that it did not honestly reflect people's underlying concerns. In other words, the Court can be taken to have responded to the fact that social norms have helped prevent open public discussion, and to have tried to promote such a discussion. 
From these points, it would be possible to celebrate what many have seen as the Court's indefensible course of rule-free judgment. Perhaps the Court has refused to foreclose an issue on which the political branches should have the final say, but nonetheless played a valuable role in ensuring that the political branches actually give the issue the attention that it warrants. Certainly, the Court's decisions have inspired a great deal of media attention and placed a kind of public spotlight on affirmative action. 
I think that ideas of this sort generally support a degree of casuistry in some areas of constitutional law, and that casuistry makes a great deal of sense in the context of hard issues on which the nation is sharply divided. But the approach may be too optimistic in the particular context of affirmative action. If it is too optimistic, this is so either because affirmative action is not problematic from the standpoint of policy and principle, or because the political process, realistically speaking, will not be deliberative at all, but instead will serve as a forum for sloganeering, mutual suspicion, and racial prejudice. 
Neither of these reservations can be easily dismissed. But in light 'of the wide range of programs labelled "affirmative action," the first reservation seems too starkly stated. Even those who approve of affirmative action should recognize that some programs are unfair and do not fulfill their intended purposes. In any case, a public discussion would serve many valuable functions. It is much too soon to know whether the second reservation is warranted. But it does seem safe to say that the area of affirmative action casts a new light on the role of the Supreme Court. It shows that the Court's catalytic role can help trigger public debate and heretofore silent protest where debate might otherwise be absent. From the standpoint of deliberative democracy, what is 
In this Essay, I make a simple and somewhat impressionistic argument. I start with the suggestion that the issue of affirmative action should be settled democratically, not judicially. Certainly the Supreme Court should not invalidate most race-conscious remedial programs. But until recently, there has been little or no sustained democratic deliberation on the issue. The citizenry's ambivalence about-or hostility toward-affirmative action has been expressed mostly in private and not in public arenas. The enormous diversity of affirmative action programs, not to mention the separable justifications for and variable efficacy of each program, has not received much public attention. Some programs work well; some do not; and neither empirical data nor public judgments about their content and value have been reflected in program design. 
In these circumstances, the Supreme Court's apparently odd behavior-its meandering course, its refusal to issue rules-in the affirmative action context might be defended as performing a valuable catalytic function. The Court's willingness to hear a number of affirmative action cases, and its complex, rule-free, highly casuistical' opinions, have had the salutary consequence of helping to stimulate public processes and directing the citizenry toward open discussion of underlying questions of policy and principle. In these ways, the Court's route has been far preferable to the most obvious alternatives: validation or invalidation of most affirmative action programs pursuant to clear doctrinal categories.

That, in a nutshell, is the argument to follow.2 I do not claim that the Court has always been self-conscious about the virtues of casuistry thus described. But if the point is correct, it bears a great deal on the relations between the Court and a well-functioning system of political deliberation. It connects, for example, to current debates about the relationship between the Constitution and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; here too, the Court might use a casuistical method to spur public discussion. There are, however, serious questions about whether current public processes are sufficiently deliberative, especially in the area of affirmative action. 
People often think one thing but say another, because of the effects of social pressures and social norms on what can be said in public? For example, in most contemporary American circles, a strong social stigma against anti-Semitic statements exists; people who think anti-Semitic things are unlikely to make such statements on television or in a public debate. In many groups where religious convictions are both deep and widespread, people cannot confess their uncertainty about whether God exists; they may attend church regularly despite their doubts on that score. In other places, people cannot acknowledge that they are deeply religious; in such places, social norms punish public declarations of religious convictions The general point is simple: social norms drive a wedge between public statements and private beliefs, hopes, and convictions. 
From this point, it emerges that "political correctness" is no isolated phenomenon limited to left-leaning intellectuals. It is a pervasive fact of social life. It appears whenever prevailing norms discourage people from taking issue with a widely held social belief. Those interested in democratic politics should notice the omnipresent role of public constraints on public statements. 
Is the existence of such constraints something to be lamented? No simple answer would make sense. Sometimes, by imposing sanctions on vicious or invidious judgments, social norms have a healthy "laundering effect."5 The existence of social sanctions can make people embarrassed about those judgments and eventually make them recede or even disappear. If "[h]ypocrisy is the homage that vice pays to virtue,"6 then social norms can identify both vice and virtue as such, and enable citizens to tell which is which. Hypocrisy can therefore have valuable social uses. It has a civilizing effect It can produce justice by making unjust behavior seem vicious or otherwise unacceptable. , 
On the other hand, social norms of the kind I am discussing can cause damage in two different ways. First, they may prevent people from offering arguments that are productive, reasonable, or even right. If prevailing norms are invidious or rooted in confusion, they may even perpetuate invidious or confused practices. Consider the many areas in the world where social norms strongly discourage advocacy of sex equality;' many women who indicate their belief in equality run enormous risks. Second, social norms may discourage the expression of doubt, even when doubt exists and when debate is, partly for that very reason, desirable and potentially productive. In that way, prevailing norms can damage processes of public deliberation. Even if prevailing norms are not invidious on their merits-even if they reflect clear thinking or hard won wisdom-their effects can be pernicious when they impair public deliberation. In a well-functioning democracy, facts and options are clarified through doubt, and people have a sense of what their fellow citizens think.. 
Of course, a certain suppression of issues and opinions stems from practical necessities. Not everything can be discussed at once. At any time, many things must be taken for granted. Some things are properly taken as so obvious that they "go without saying." But in many areas, one can safely say that democratic processes would be better if public debate focused on what really concerns people. 
From the standpoint of both law and democratic theory, a great deal needs to be done on this important topic. We do not know the extent to which actual private judgments are not expressed publicly, even when they are quite widespread, and when the reason for silence is that THEORY 75 (Jon Elster & Aanund Hylland eds., 1986).

(Elizabeth Rapaport ed., Hackett Publishing 1978) (1859). social norms impose sanctions on the public expression of those judgments. It is therefore important to take account of possible disparities between what is said and what is thought. It is also important to know how wide such disparities are, whether the disparities reflect biases, and whether some social institutions or practices facilitate or inhibit open discussion. 
II 
THE SUPREME COURT AS CATALYST 
It seems obvious to say that when the Supreme Court faces a constitutional attack on a law, it has three basic options: it might uphold the law, it might invalidate the law, or it might refuse to address the issue by denying certiorari or by taking advantage of various avoidance strategies. 
A detailed literature discusses the third and least obvious of these options.'0 On a familiar view, the Court should often permit issues to "percolate" in lower courts and in the nation as a whole. Through this route, it can allow many forms of legal and political discussion and debate; in that way, the Court avoids premature judicial foreclosure of hard questions. The Court might take this route for practical reasons or for reasons of principle. Perhaps a firm judicial resolution would be poorly received by the community." Surely this point bears on possible judicial foreclosure of affirmative action programs, say, twenty-five years ago. Perhaps a judicial resolution would disserve the very cause that the Court is seeking to promote. This point has been vigorously urged in the context of abortion, where (it is said) the Court's early judicial decision in Roe v. Wade2 helped undermine the movement for sex equality. 3 Certainly judicial decisions can have unintended social consequences, and this practical point argues in favor of judicial caution. The Court might also avoid premature foreclosure because of its own humility. The Court might lack relevant information and wait to see how a certain practice works out in reality. Or the Court might believe that certain issues are difficult from the standpoint of (legally relevant) morality and therefore, in principle, it is important to ensure that a good deal of public deliberation occurs before the Court acts. 
These are important points, and as we will see they bear a great deal on the issues raised by affirmative action. But the Court actually has a (discussing the Supreme Court's practice to withhold exercise ofpower of judical review). 
"constrained" by various social and cultural conditions, including public opinion). 

the political efficacy of pro-choice forces"). fourth option: it can issue a highly casuistical decision, one that resolves little beyond the single case, but that operates as a catalyst for public discussion. By assuming jurisdiction, by offering a ruling, but by issuing a ruling that is case-specific and along crucial dimensions not authoritative for the future, it can call public attention to a problem without foreclosing public judgment. This fourth option is especially appropriate when the Court is uncertain about whether general rules would be satisfactory, and when it believes that differences of fact and content are highly relevant to constitutional outcomes. 
There is, of course, a large debate within the Court and within the scholarly community about the virtues of case-by-case particularism. 14 Defenders of particularism often speak of the need to proceed cautiously in the midst of ignorance about issues not before the Court. 15 But particularism also has a democratic function, and this is so in two different ways. Judicial particularists can promote democratic virtues of participation and responsiveness, by ensuring that people are not foreclosed by rulings involving previous litigants who have somewhat different complaints. The process of judicial particularism allows each person to have a day in court, invoking the distinctive features of his or her case. 6 But there is an independent point. Particularist decisions allow people, through democratic processes, to continue to debate issues, secure in the knowledge that courts have not attempted to have a final say. In this respect, case-specific judgments operate as a kind of "remand" to the public for further proceedings, at least in the sense that they do not foreclose those proceedings and may even spur them through the visibility of court decisions. 
In administrative law, a remand to the agency for further proceedings is an exceedingly common phenomenon.17 In the remand, the agency is permitted to do as it originally did, but it must offer a new and better justification. The court's decision is case-specific; it can easily be "distinguished" by a resourceful administrator, even on the same set of facts. Much debate exists over whether this process generally tends to work out well. 8 But when it does, the remand promotes better public deliberation by drawing attention to difficulties that had not yet received adequate attention, and by helping to produce better processes of deliberation for the future."' 
Much of constitutional law has a structure similar to the administrative law remand. 0 Sometimes the Court effectively "remands" issues for fresh deliberation.2 Many of the modem privacy cases involving sexual autonomy can be understood accordingly.' In these cases, the state defended laws restricting availability of contraception by reference to the goal of preventing premarital or extramarital activity. The Court did not deny that the state has a legitimate interest in preventing nonmarital sexual activity. We do not say that a law directly punishing such activity is unconstitutional. But, the state may not attempt to promote the underlying interest through the indirect means of preventing contraception. If the state is genuinely interested in preventing nonmarital sexual relations, it must pursue that policy in a way that receives meaningful democratic scrutiny and reflects actual democratic approval of the underlying judgment of policy and principle-through the criminal sanction. The more indirect and discriminatory route of preventing contraception is an unacceptable means of pursuing the relevant end. Because of its indirection, a ban on contraceptives does not accurately reflect a democratic judgment against extramarital relations. In fact, no such judgment followed the Court's cases because the public was unwilling to use the criminal sanction to punish extramarital relations directly.

THE AFFRMATIVE ACTION MUDDLE 
It is easy to be skeptical about the Supreme Court's affirmative action cases. From the standpoint of the rule of law, the cases are truly a mess. This was so from the very start. In Regents of the University of Californiav. Bakke,' the Court was badly divided and could not produce a majority opinion. Of course, the often-criticized "rule" of the case was that universities may use race "as a factor" in admissions, but may not create quotas.' While this rule has played a crucial role in American society and American debate, it represented the view of Justice Powell alone. The other eight participating justices explicitly rejected that rule. Ironically, the case stands for a proposition that only one justice thought sensible. 
Bakke was not an auspicious beginning for those seeking clear rules. The Court's second affirmative action case, Fullilove v. Klutznick, compounded the problem.'s In that case, no majority spoke for the Court, no standard of review was selected for affirmative action cases, and by the plurality's own admission, its decision was highly dependent on the facts of the particular case.' In another case with slightly different facts, the outcome might be different. 27 Remarkably, during the next nine years, the Court's decisions developed no clear standard of review and seemed to turn not on rules, but instead on a large set of factors: -whether official findings of past discrimination had been made;' -whether the relevant program was rigid or flexible;29 -whether the relevant program operated as a quota; 0

of past discrimination by the government department involved before racial classifications can be used to remedy discrimination). 
-whether the relevant program had been issued by Congress, by another politically accountable body, by a court, or by some other institution;3 -whether innocent victims were injured, and if so in a severe way;32 -and more.33 The use of these numerous factors led to surprising decisions in particular cases, and outcomes were hard to predict in advance. Notably, some of these factors relate to the nature of the deliberative process itself. The relevant cases received a good deal of public attention, but the constitutional position of affirmative action programs remained quite obscure 4 
It was not until 1989 that the Court finally settled on a standard of review. In City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 35 a plurality of the Court held that affirmative action programs would be subject to "strict scrutiny," at least if they had not been enacted by the federal government3. 6 But even while announcing a standard of review, it did so in such a way as to leave the law exceptionally obscure, and to leave the many decisions that preceded Croson in an uncertain state.37 Hence, Croson did not reject the Court's casuistical approach to affirmative action. And in Adarand Constructors Inc. v. Pena,31 when the Court finally announced that the same standard of review applied to the nation as to the states,39 it went out of its way to make clear that the standard would not lead to automatic invalidation, that outcomes would turn on particular facts,' and thus that we could not foresee certain results in future cases. 
As a result, there is still--eighteen years and numerous Supreme Court cases after Bakke-a high degree of uncertainty about the law governing affirmative action. The public reaction to Adarand shows that a great deal of doubt about whether affirmative action is constitutionally permissible still remains.41 Now, as before, the validity of an affirmative action program greatly depends on the particular case. 
What has the Court achieved? Perhaps the Court has succeeded in invalidating the most indefensible affirmative action plans and in upholding the most legitimate. This would certainly be the optimist's view.42 But if we step back a bit, we might conclude that the Court has helped keep the nation's eye on the affirmative action issue--on the questions of policy and principle that lie behind the debate-while at the same time failing to preempt processes of public discussion and debate. Above all, the Court has done this because it has decided a large number of cases, but proceeded in a highly particularistic manner.

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND PUBLIC DEBATE 
It seems reasonable to think that the question of affirmative action should be settled democratically, not judicially. Despite frequent prot39. Id. at 2117 (holding that all government-established racial classifications must be analyzed under the strict scrutiny standard of review). 
we wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is 'strict in theory, but fatal in fact.' The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified from acting in response to it.... When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such action is within constitutional constraints if it satisfies the 'narrow tailoring' test this Court has set out in previous cases. 
Id. (citations omitted). 
RELATIONS RPTR.: FAut EMPLOYMENT PRACrIcEs MANUAL (BNA) 221 (June 28, 1995). 
Broadcasting Inc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547 (1990), is probably the least defensible, but the Court actually upheld it. The Court said that the minority set-aside in the broadcasting area could be defended as a way of ensuring that the minority community would receive broadcasting of its choice. Id. But-and this is a central point--there was no requirement that minority-owned stations provide broadcasting for minority communities. The reason that there was no such requirement was that it would, on the conventional view, violate the First Amendment. Thus, the Court upheld the minority set-aside as a proxy (admittedly a very crude one) for an end that was generally believed unconstitutional. estations to the contrary,43 the Constitution imposes no clear textual ban on affirmative action. In fact, the textual arguments are laughably inadequate. To be sure, the Constitution calls for "equal" protection of the laws; but this point is uninformative on the validity of affirmative action.' The term "equal" cannot possibly mean "the same," if "the same" is intended to suggest a ban on all classification. By their nature, laws classify. Even the law of equal protection classifies. Thus, it is no offense to the Equal Protection Clause if courts scrutinize sex-based classifications more skeptically than they scrutinize age-based classifications--even though this difference does not treat people "the same." The question is what the word "equal" requires in this context. Dictionaries are unhelpful here. The only way to make progress is to go outside of the text; we must look there to find possible understandings of the Constitution's equality principle. 
Nor is it helpful to say that the Constitution speaks of "any person" rather than of groups." The Supreme Court, together with many scholars, appears to think that the reference to "any person" means that the clause speaks of individuals rather than of groups, and that this point counts against affirmative action.46 This claim contains some truth, but it is misleading. To be sure, "any person" may complain that a classification is constitutionally unacceptable. But on what grounds can "any person" seek special judicial assistance? Under the Equal Protection Clause, all claims of unconstitutionaldiscriminationare necessarily based on complaints about treatment that singles out a characteristic shared by a group. A glance at the cases, or at any imaginable set of cases, shows that anyone who complains of unconstitutional discrimination is necessarily complaining about the government's use, for purposes of classification, of some characteristic that is shared by some number of group members. The question is whether the government's use of that shared characteristic is disfavored from the constitutional point of view. There is no serious question about whether the characteristics of which "any person" may complain are shared characteristics; of course they are. In this sense, claims of unconstitutional discrimination are always group-based claims, even if they are made by ''any person."

PUBLIC DELIBERATIONAND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 
For example, suppose that Jones has been denied a government job. As a "person," she has a right to make a complaint under the Equal Protection Clause. But everything depends on the characteristic on which government has allegedly seized. For Jones to claim heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, she has to say something about the classification that the government has used; and she must say that the classification treats her, as a member of a certain group, in a "suspect" way. Thus she has a claim to careful scrutiny of laws disadvantaging her if those laws classify on the basis of sex. But if she invokes another characteristic, she has no such claim. The same plaintiff Jones has no right to heightened judicial scrutiny if those laws classify on the basis of age.47 She is thus entitled to a degree of scrutiny corresponding to the basis of the classification of which she complains. 
In short, almost all classifications involve "groups." The issue is whether heightened scrutiny represents the appropriate standard of review for the particular classification that the government has used. The fact that the Constitution refers to "any person" is utterly uninformative regarding whether any particular foundation for classification should, or does, meet heightened judicial scrutiny. The Court's use of the constitutional text as a justification for heightened scrutiny is bad formalism-the pretense that the legal text resolves the question when the judgment must actually be based on other grounds. 
If the text of the Constitution does not ban affirmative action, what of the Constitution's history? It might be tempting to say that it is a lesson of the Civil War that all racial classifications are unacceptable. But the history shows no such particular understanding on the part of those who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment. On the contrary, it tends to suggest that affirmative action policies were regarded as legitimate. The Reconstruction Congress that approved the Fourteenth Amendment concurrently enacted a number of race-specific programs for AfricanAmericans." A substantial debate about whether such programs were legitimate occurred, and the people who controlled Congress after the Civil War concluded that they were. No evidence exists in the Fourteenth Amendment ratification debates that all race-conscious programs would be impermissible.49 
History need not be decisive. Perhaps a moral argument justifies the Court in reading the text to ban affirmative action. But no clear moral argument requires courts to treat affirmative action policies with great skepticism. Many critics of affirmative action claim that the moral argument lay at the heart of the work of Martin Luther King, Jr., and others in the civil rights movements of the 1960s; ยฐ but this is an historical error. Asked in 1965 whether it was "fair to request a multibilliondollar program of preferential treatment for the Negro, or for any other minority group," King flatly replied, "I do indeed."51 In 1966, King wrote, 
It is impossible to create a formula for the future which does not take into account that our society has been doing something special againstthe Negro for hundreds of years. How then can he be absorbed into the mainstream of American life if we do not do something special for him now, in order to balance the equation and equip him to compete on a just and equal basis?"" In fact, King's 1964 book, Why We Can't Wait, criticized the idea that once African Americans had been granted simple equality before the law, no further action should be taken. He wrote, 
On the surface, this appears reasonable, but it is not realistic. For it is obvious that if a man is entered at the starting line in a race three hundred years after another man, the first would have to perform some impossible feat in order to catch up with his fellow runner.53 
The views of Martin Luther King, Jr., need not be decisive. Perhaps a moral principle of color-blindness deserves constitutional recognition; certainly this is so if it is the only intelligible principle behind the constitutional concern for racial equality. But we can identify an alternative moral principle, one that has actually been responsible for most of the movement for racial change in America, both during the Civil War and thereafter. In the area of race, a large target of the Civil War Amendments was the preexisting system of racial caste: a system that turned the highly visible and morally irrelevant characteristic of race into a systemic basis for second-class citizenship.' The Fourteenth Amendment is best conceived of as opposing that caste system.5 5 And if this represents the best conception of the Fourteenth Amendment, then there is nothing fundamentally illegitimate about affirmative action programs. 56 Such programs are designed to overcome caste-like features of SOCIETY (1995).

existing practice. This does not mean that they are a good idea, as they may not have this effect. It may be that they are bad on grounds of policy and should be rejected in democratic and administrative arenas. But that possibility does not make them constitutionally objectionable. 
In fact, the Supreme Court has yet to provide a clear explanation of the principle that requires affirmative action programs to be treated so skeptically.Y Most of its argument depends on a false claim of symmetry: if discrimination against African Americans is presumptively forbidden, how can discrimination against whites be presumptively legitimate? 8 This question is anything but rhetorical. It is no better than the question, if discrimination on the basis of sex is presumed illegitimate, how can the same not be true for discrimination on the basis of age? In fact, the anticaste principle helps provide an answer to both questions, and that answer suggests that different forms of discrimination are utterly different. To be sure, the Court has referred to a set of legitimate concerns about affirmative action policies: the social divisiveness of affirmative action, the ordinary moral irrelevance of race, the fact that race is not chosen voluntarily, and the possibility that affirmative action programs will stigmatize their intended beneficiaries. But none of these points supports a convincing constitutional complaint about affirmative action.59 Many things that government does are divisive, yet they are not unconstitutional for that reason. Many characteristics that are morally irrelevant, and that are not voluntarily chosen, are used by government as classifying devices; consider height, strength, and intelligence. Affrmnative action programs may well stigmatize their intended beneficiaries. But the same is plausibly true for programs that benefit children of alumni or people from underrepresented regions, and those programs are not, because of their stigmatizing effects, unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
Affirmative Action and the PublicInterest, 1995 Sup. Cr. REv. 1. Undoubtedly, interest-group power does underlie some affirmative action programs. But why should this form of interest-group victory receive careful judicial scrutiny, while other forms do not? 
Occasionally, the cases also suggest that racial classifications produce social division. See, e.g., City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989) (O'Connor, J.) (plurality opinion); Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 545 (1980) (Stevens, J., dissenting). This may well be true. But an absence of affirmative action programs would also produce social division. In any case, many government programs appear to promote social division, and they are not constitutionally suspect for that reason. Some examples include veterans' preference laws, laws supporting public education, as well as laws supporting art and culture. 
offers no argument against preferential treatment even though preferential treatment is one of the book's central targets. 

These remarks certainly do not mean that affirmative action programs are a good idea. The range of such programs is very wide, and to make a judgment on them, it is important to have a sense of their variety and of their consequences. Such programs include relatively uncontroversial efforts to increase the pool of applicants by ensuring that the candidates are diverse; these efforts are certainly race-conscious, but at the stage of recruitment rather than actual appointment. It is hard to see why such efforts are objectionable. Other affirmative action programs include race as a factor among many others. Still other programs include rigid quota systems as well. Some programs give a minor boost to highly qualified candidates, and some allow people entry into programs for which they are ill-suited. Evaluation of such programs should depend partly on their content and their consequences, and the term "affirmative action programs" is far too imprecise to speak adequately on that score. Above all, We need to know how such programs are operating in the real world. Undoubtedly, many affirmative action programs are successful and perceived as such. 
It is striking but true that until the very recent past, the nation had yet to have a sustained discussion about the legitimacy and variety of affirmative action programs and of possible alternatives.' When Congress adopted the 1964 Civil Rights Act, discrimination against African Americans was of course the central focus of the debate.6' Affirmative action programs were in an embryonic state and did not receive much, if any, consideration.62 The first important affirmative action program was actually adopted by Executive Order.63 The proliferation of such programs at the national, state, and local levels has proceeded without sustained attention to the underlying issues of principle and policy. Whatever one thinks about the legitimacy of affirmative action, this lack of deliberation is quite disturbing.' 
In fact, it is plausible to think that some of the public backlash against affirmative action is attributable to the perception that the relevant programs have never been debated and defended publicly. It is not at all true to say, as many do, that affirmative action programs are a creation of federal courts;' many such programs have their origins in private decisions or in decisions of politically accountable bodies. But the widespread perception that affirmative action programs are courtgenerated is illuminating insofar as it suggests a belief that such programs have not been ratified publicly. 
We are now in a position to discuss the possible catalytic role of the Supreme Court insofar as that role bears on the affirmative action debate. Suppose that it is agreed that the issue of affirmative action should be decided democratically rather than judicially-but suppose, too, that institutions are operating in such a way as to ensure that any public decisions are taken in an unaccountable way, and are not really a product of democratic judgments. The Supreme Court's meandering, casuistical, rule-free path may well be a salutary way of signaling the existence of large questions of policy and principle, at least with constitutional dimensions, when those questions would otherwise receive far less attention than they deserve. Hence, the participants in Supreme Court cases have become familiar "characters" in the national debate, helping to frame discussion: people like Bakke," Weber,6 7 Johnson,68 minority construction contractors, 9 and others. 
Judicial signaling is especially important in a context where social norms may have an adverse effect on open public discussion. Suppose that a policy persists not because people are in favor of it, but because social norms prevent people from voicing their complaints publicly. Suppose too that these complaints are widespread. If this is so, 70 there is a democratic problem that requires attention. At least as a general rule, something should be done to ensure that the issue receives public consideration. Private actors can help to remedy the situation. We might describe as "norm entrepreneurs" those people who try to activate private beliefs and judgments in favor of a shift in existing social norms. But official institutions can play a role as well. In particular, the Supreme Court can signal the existence of hard questions of political morality and public policy, by taking cases, drawing public attention to the underlying questions, and refusing to issue authoritative pronouncements. And if we examine the Court's practice in the area of affirmative action, we can see that the Court has operated in precisely this way. It has helped keep the affirmative action issue in the public domain without foreclosing public deliberation. In this way, the Court has served a valuable catalytic function. 
I do not claim that the Court has been self-conscious about its role. But some of the justices, especially Justices O'Connor and Powell, have undoubtedly been aware of the difficulty and variety of the affirmative action problem and have chosen a casuistical approach for this reason. Nor do I claim that the current public interest in affirmative action owes its origin to Supreme Court decisions. There are undoubtedly a wide range of factors that could be said to have played a catalytic role. All I contend is that the Court's decisions have been among the factors that have both kept affirmative action in the public eye and helped focus the public on issues of principle and policy. And to the extent that those effects have been salutary, the Court's practice here bears on other meandering paths in the past, 3 and also on future practices, perhaps in the area of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, where a degree of casuistry also makes a good deal of sense.74 
I cannot offer here a full discussion of when casuistry in the interest of public deliberation is a desirable strategy for the Court,75 but a few brief remarks may be helpful. The casuistical approach makes most sense when the Court is uncertain or divided about whether any broad rule is constitutionally sound. It follows that in the affirmative action context, the Court's approach is more attractive to those who are unsure about the constitutional status of affirmative action. For those who believe that it is per se invalid, or clearly acceptable in all circumstances, judicial casuistry would be harder to defend. Casuistry will seem most sensible to those who believe that the relevant outcome should turn on particular facts. In the affirmative action context, we might think that a rigid quota system is worse than "race as a factor," or that universities have special reasons to engage in race-conscious programs. 
Equally important, the argument for casuistry, as a catalytic approach, is strengthened by a judgment that judicial decisions will in fact spur, or at least be a healthy part of, ongoing processes of public deliberation. The argument becomes even stronger if those processes at least have the potential to function well. If this is so, judicial casuistry may promote, rather than undermine, the system of democratic deliberation. If, on the other hand, public deliberation is unlikely in any event, or likely to operate very badly, a more rule-bound approach to the Constitution would be better. Obviously there are empirical issues here that I have not resolved. 
On these grounds, we can see how the Court's casuistical decisions, defended in the way I have here, might best be criticized. Perhaps the Constitution is sensibly interpreted to ban all affirmative action programs (though I have suggested that this would be a most adventurous reading). Perhaps the Constitution is best understood not to draw such programs into question at all. Or perhaps democratic processes have been working very well without the Court, and the Court's decisions have been marginally relevant, or have even helped to facilitate distortions of democratic deliberation. I do not believe this judgment could be supported, but it suggests the direction in which a challenge to the Court's approach might move. It suggests, too, how judicial casuistry might be evaluated in the context of such issues as discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. I believe, for example, that most such discrimination is unacceptable under the Equal Protection Clause. But it may very well make sense for the Court to proceed slowly, cautiously, and in a case-specific way, because of the variety of possible settings, the practical need to build on democratic judgments, and the value of judicial humility in the face of so controversial a public issue, one that is now receiving considerable public attention.76 
VI AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, DELIBERATIVE GOVERNMENT, AND 
THE REFERENDUM 
The suggestion that the Court has helped catalyze public debate should not by any means be taken as a claim that with respect to affirmative action, the democratic process has been or is now working well. With "norm cascades"-large shifts in current norms-there is a risk that outcomes will be based on sensationalistic anecdotes, on factual misperceptions, or, worse, on simple racism and hatred. Undoubtedly, objections to affirmative action programs are often well-motivated; it would be ludicrous to think that such objections are necessarily rooted in racial prejudice. But appeals to racism, usually tacit, are a large part of the debate. Some people might think that affirmative action is an unpromising area for public deliberation precisely because of the likelihood that racist motivations will be at work. If this is an unpromising area for public deliberation, the argument for a catalytic effort from the Court is of course weakened, and judges might attempt to resolve the problem on other grounds. 
The relevant risks are especially severe in the context of a referendum, which bypasses ordinary filters of political representation and hence raises special risks.n Referenda may well be based on inadequate information and on popular passions that are insufficiently influenced by reason-giving and understanding of context. 7' This was of course a relevant concern in the framing period.79 
Much national attention is now focused on a referendum proposal in California designed to eliminate preferential treatment based on race.8" Political processes in California on this issue do not appear to be deliberative. The American system is one of representative rather than direct democracy, partly because of a judgment that political deliberation can be best promoted through a representative system.8' If judicial decisions stimulate poorly functioning referendum processes, little will be gained. 
In the context of affirmative action in particular, there is a danger that referendum outcomes will not be based on a careful assessment of facts and values, but instead on crude "we-they" thinking. This is a DEMOCRATIC REFORM (1991). 

state constitution (dubbed by its supporters as the "California Civil Rights Initiative"): Neither the State of California nor any of its political subdivisions or agents shall use race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin as a criterion for either discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individual or group in the operation of the State's system ofpublic employment, public education, or public contracting.

REASON: DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY AND AMERICAN NATIONAL GOVERNMENT (1994). danger in the context of race. It is not my purpose here to evaluate that risk. But if a catalytic role from the Court serves to intensify poorly functioning majoritarian processes, that role may be nothing to celebrate. Both exercises of statesmanship and institutional correctivesdisplacing the referendum process with more insulated bodies-may be in order. Hence, it is appropriate to assemble politically insulated groups to try to compile information about the actual effects of affirmative action programs.83 
Unfortunately, it is unclear whether the Supreme Court can do a great deal to make things better. Some people have suggested that the Court might review the outcomes of referenda with an unusually high degree of skepticism.' There is some sense in this suggestion. An approach of this kind can find structural support in the Constitution, which is rooted in faith in representation, and in the Constitution's most fundamental underlying concerns. It is plausible to say that the Court should be mildly more receptive to a constitutional challenge when legislation has come through referenda. But no provision of the Constitution specifically authorizes judges to regard the outcomes of referenda as less legitimate than the outcomes of representative processes, and in any case it is not, under current law, easy to see how someone might challenge a ban on affirmative action on these constitutional grounds.85 
CONCLUSION 
In this essay, I have tried to connect two ideas. The first involves the disjunction between private beliefs and public statements-a disjunction that stems from social norms that can discourage honest public argument about public issues and in that way undermine values that animate the First Amendment itself. The second involves the catalytic (1996), which provides in pertinent part: 
Neither the State of Colorado, through any of its branches or departments, nor any of its agencies, political subdivisions, municipalities or school districts, shall enact, adopt or enforce any statute, regulation, ordinance or policy whereby homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships shall constitute or otherwise be the basis of or entitle any person or class of persons to have or claim any minority status, quota preferences, protected status or claim of discrimination.

required by the Constitution except in certain narrow circumstances, such as when race-conscious remedies are constitutionally required for remedial purposes. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenberg Bd. ofEduc., 402 U.S. 1 (1971). animate the First Amendment itself. The second involves the catalytic role of the Supreme Court. This role is ordinarily thought to involve three principal powers: validating or invalidating laws, and refusing to hear cases. But the Court has a fourth power-the authority to issue highly casuistical rulings that do not settle much, but that operate as a kind of "remand" to the public, alerting people to the existence of hard issues of principle and policy. In the affirmative action context, the Court, whether or not intentionally, has done precisely this. It has said little that is authoritative. It has, however, helped trigger public debate, with, perhaps, an understanding on the part of some of the Justices that until recently, the debate was neither broadly inclusive nor properly deliberative-and that it did not honestly reflect people's underlying concerns. In other words, the Court can be taken to have responded to the fact that social norms have helped prevent open public discussion, and to have tried to promote such a discussion. 
From these points, it would be possible to celebrate what many have seen as the Court's indefensible course of rule-free judgment. Perhaps the Court has refused to foreclose an issue on which the political branches should have the final say, but nonetheless played a valuable role in ensuring that the political branches actually give the issue the attention that it warrants. Certainly, the Court's decisions have inspired a great deal of media attention and placed a kind of public spotlight on affirmative action. 
I think that ideas of this sort generally support a degree of casuistry in some areas of constitutional law, and that casuistry makes a great deal of sense in the context of hard issues on which the nation is sharply divided. But the approach may be too optimistic in the particular context of affirmative action. If it is too optimistic, this is so either because affirmative action is not problematic from the standpoint of policy and principle, or because the political process, realistically speaking, will not be deliberative at all, but instead will serve as a forum for sloganeering, mutual suspicion, and racial prejudice. 
Neither of these reservations can be easily dismissed. But in light 'of the wide range of programs labelled "affirmative action," the first reservation seems too starkly stated. Even those who approve of affirmative action should recognize that some programs are unfair and do not fulfill their intended purposes. In any case, a public discussion would serve many valuable functions. It is much too soon to know whether the second reservation is warranted. But it does seem safe to say that the area of affirmative action casts a new light on the role of the Supreme Court. It shows that the Court's catalytic role can help trigger public debate and heretofore silent protest where debate might otherwise be absent. From the standpoint of deliberative democracy, what is catalyzed may be nothing to celebrate, at least in the context of race. But remedies for that large problem would take me well beyond the present discussion.

The Right to Die 
In a number of cases, people with terminal illnesses are seeking to end their lives with the aid of a physician.' Many such people suffer from hopeless conditions of increasing debilitation, sometimes accompanied by periods of excruciating pain. It was inevitable that circumstances of this kind would raise constitutional questions. Two recent cases have turned the "right to die"-or, more precisely, the right to physician-assisted suicide-into the next great arena for the struggle to define the scope of fundamental rights under the Due Process Clause. In Quill v.Vacco," the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected the due process claim but held, somewhat astonishingly, that New York had acted "irrationally" and hence in violation of the Equal Protection Clause because it prohibited physician-assisted suicide while simultaneously permitting patients to withdraw life-saving equipment. In 
Circuit held straightforwardly that a prohibition on the right to physicianassisted suicide violates the Due Process Clause. 
In this Essay, I argue that the Supreme Court should not invalidate laws forbidding physician-assisted suicide. My basic claim is institutional: The Court should be wary of recognizing rights of this kind amid complex issues of fact and value, at least if reasonable people can decide those issues either way, and if the Court cannot identify malfunctions in the system of deliberative democracy that justify a more aggressive judicial role.- The issues t Karl N.

cautious judicial role partly because judicial judgments may be wrong and partly because judicial judgments 1123 presented by a right to physician-assisted suicide are especially well-suited to a federal system, where appropriate experiments may be made, and where such experiments are likely to provide valuable information about underlying risks. It is particularly important that the issue of physician-assisted suicide is facing not neglect or indifference but intense discussion in many states.5 It is far too early for courts to preempt these processes of discussion, especially if we consider the fact that there is no systematic barrier to a fair hearing of any affected group. Despite appearances, the Court's current doctrines reflect this point. Thus a general theme of this Essay is that many cases involving "fundamental rights"-including the key privacy cases and the key equal protection cases-are best seen not as flat declarations that the state interest was inadequate to justify the state's intrusion, but more narrowly as democracy-forcing outcomes designed to overcome problems of discrimination and desuetude. 
In short, the Court should say that even if it assumes that the right to physician-assisted suicide qualifies as "fundamental" under the Due Process Clause, a legal ban on physician-assisted suicide is constitutionally permissible in light of the state's legitimate and weighty interests in preventing abuse, protecting patient autonomy, and avoiding involuntary death. The Court should reach this conclusion partly because of appropriate judicial modesty in the face of difficult underlying questions of value and fact;6 it should emphasize these institutional concerns in explaining its conclusion. 
To present the argument in more specific and somewhat more technical terms, it does not seem especially controversial to say that the state needs a strong justification if it seeks to intrude on the decision of a competent adult to terminate his life under medically hopeless and physically painful conditions.7 But it is extremely difficult either to describe the standard for "fundamental rights" that emerges from the existing cases or to tell whether may cause serious social problems even if they are right. See infra text accompanying notes 129-33. By "recognizing rights," I mean invalidating legislation; as suggested below, I do think these cases are an appropriate setting for recognizing a presumptive right, in the sense that the state should be required to bring forward a strong justification for any intrusion. 
sponsored a widely discussed Task Force report in 1994 that rejected legalization of physician-assisted suicide. See Quill, 80 F.3d at 734-35 (Calabresi, J., concurring) (describing New York background); Compassion in Dying v. Washington, 49 F.3d 586, 591-92 (9th Cir. 1995) (describing discussion in New York and Michigan), rev'd, Compassion in Dying, 79 F.3d 790. 
discussion is DAN W. BROCK, LIFE AND DEATH 202-30 (1993), which argues for autonomy right and challenges the distinction between withdrawal of treatment and active euthanasia. See also RONALD DWORKIN, LIFE'S DOMINION 218-41 (1993) (arguing for autonomy right); John Keown, Euthanasiain the Netherlands:Sliding down the Slippery Slope?, in EUTHANASIA EXAMINED 261, 261-62 (John Keown ed., 1995) (collecting various positions about whether voluntary euthanasia will lead to involuntary euthanasia). As will become apparent, the philosophical issue is far from coextensive with the constitutional issue, and there is a limit to how much progress can be made through philosophical discussion alone; many of the key questions are empirical, involving the real-world effects of the relevant right. 
the right to physician-assisted suicide qualifies as "fundamental" under those cases. We might want to read current law to say that there is a presumptive right8 againstgovernment intrusion into a decision whether to terminateone's life under hopeless conditions or, alternatively and more broadly, a presumptive right against nontrivial government-imposed intrusions into the physical space of one's own body. In some cases, the right to physicianassisted suicide certainly meets the former standard, and while it does not quite meet the latter-it is a right "to" invasion, not a right "from" invasion-that right should probably be taken as close enough to the rights established by the existing case law to qualify as "fundamental" for constitutional purposes when the patient faces medically hopeless conditions. At the very least, it would be reasonable for the Court to make this assumption for purposes of decision. But-and this is the central point-the state has an array of strong justifications for intruding on that right. These justifications involve the risk of abuse by doctors and others and the danger that a right to physician-assisted suicide would, in practice, decrease rather than increase patient autonomy. 
The state may believe, for example, that recognition of the right would allow people suffering from depression and distorted judgment to terminate their lives when their judgments should not readily be trusted; that a right to physician-assisted suicide would discourage people from dealing more productively with their distress and with the fact of death; that the line between hopeless and hopeful conditions is too thin in practice and that any right to physician-assisted suicide would thus produce premature deaths; that at least some doctors, carrying a great deal of authority and faced with multiple demands on their time, would present death as an option in such a way that some patients would have a hard time refusing; that some well-meaning families would impose irresistible pressures on terminal patients to "choose" death; or that any such right would have harmful effects on the performance and norms of the medical profession and perhaps on the norms of the citizenry in general. On some of these counts, the right to remove life-sustaining equipment is quite different from the right to physician-assisted suicide, because the latter creates far more serious risks of abuse. At least relevant in this regard is the fact that numerous doctors-aware of the underlying risks-oppose a right to physician-assisted suicide.'" In these circumstances, the Supreme Court should decline to impose a national solution. 
This is emphatically not an argument against physician-assisted suicide as a matter of public policy. 
Many of the individual cases present powerful arguments for respecting the patient's wishes. A reader of those cases and the relevant literature may well conclude (as I would) that, in the end, states should probably allow physician-assisted suicide-because strong autonomy interests favor the right, social and familial interests support the right, the risks that trouble opponents of the right may not be as severe as they appear, and those risks can be handled through procedural safeguards short of denying the right." 
Eventually, it may be predicted that the 
and other nations will indeed come to recognize a right to physician-assisted suicide under appropriate conditions, accompanied by procedural safeguards. 12 While any judgment must be tentative, I believe that this is likely to be a salutary development.'3

POSNER, AGING AND OLD AGE 235-45 (1995) (arguing on behalf of right to physician-assisted suicide); see also Keown, supra note 6, at 263-66 (describing controversial safeguards in Netherlands). Keown identifies safeguards requiring that the request must come from the patient and be free and voluntary; the request must be well-considered, durable, and persistent; the patient must be intolerably suffering, with no hope of improvement; euthanasia must be the last resort, after other alternatives have failed; euthanasia must be performed by the physician; the physician must consult with another physician trained in the field; and the death record should not indicate death of "natural causes." These safeguards are controversial because it is not clear that they are respected in practice. See id.; see also HERBERT HENDIN, SEDUCED BY DEATH 47-95 (1997).

question doctrine"-a doctrine that would allow the Court to decline to validate or invalidate legislation, and to suspend its judgment about constitutionality until a certain period of democratic deliberation (and clarification of relevant issues) has passed. The Court can deny certiorari, of course, and there are analogues in American law to such a doctrine, see infra Section IV.C (discussing desuetude and associated doctrines), but the idea has no explicit constitutional foundation. Such a doctrine would be especially well-suited to the right to physician-assisted suicide. 
of an autonomy right. 

The principle that a competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our prior decisions .... Although we think the logic of the cases ... would embrace such a liberty interest (in resisting the forced administration of life-sustaining medical treatment], the dramatic consequences involved in justification for intruding on that interest. In any case, many states allow citizens to decline medical treatment.' 6 
The distinction between the right to withdraw life-sustaining equipment and the right to physician-assisted suicide is problematic in many ways, 7 but here I am speaking of cases that involve more than the withdrawal of treatment. Consider the following possibilities, designed to give a sense of the range of factual contexts in which the right might be claimed. (1) A competent patient seeks death under conditions that are both medically hopeless, in the sense that the best medical judgment is that there is a fixed and relatively short time to live, and physically difficult and debilitating, in the sense that the patient will experience some intense pain. 8 (2) A competent patient seeks death under conditions that are medically hopeless, but do not involve much physical pain. (3) A competent patient with a disease that will produce a long period of deterioration and a long span of life-Alzheimer's disease is the most familiar example-seeks to terminate her life at some stage before the deterioration becomes serious. (4) A patient may be unconscious or otherwise incompetent and also in a medically hopeless state; his family or guardian seeks death, with or without evidence that this would be the patient's desire. These might be called cases of nonvoluntary euthanasia, as distinguished from voluntary and involuntary euthanasia. (5) A competent patient may be facing a severe medical problem. Though his condition is not utterly hopeless, he may seek death because he is generally depressed or no longer considers life worth living. (6) A patient may be facing a period of sustained medical difficulty without knowing whether or not some improvement is eventually possible. His condition is therefore considerably better than in (5), but he seeks death because he no longer considers life worth living. (7) Any of the above conditions might involve a person who seeks death, not with the assistance of a physician, but with the assistance of a friend or family member. refusal of such treatment would inform the inquiry as towhether the deprivation of that interest is constitutionally permissible. But for purposes of this case. %e assume that the United States Constitution would grant a competent person a constitutionally protected rightto refuse lifesaving hydration and nutrition.

J . concurrng) ("[Tihe liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause must protect. if it protects an) thing. an individual's deeply personal decision to reject medical treatment, including the artificial dehery of food and %ater.")

example, Brock writes: 
There are not great numbers of patients undergoing severe suffenng that can only be relieved by directly killing them. Modem methods of pain management enable physicians and nurses to control the pain of virtually all such patients without the use of lethal poisons. though often at the cost of so sedating the patient that interaction and communication with others is limited or no longer possible. 
BROCK, supra note 6,at 170. 
These various situations present quite different issues. In case (4), there is a question about whether we have sufficient reason to believe the third party's judgment about the patient's desires. In case (5), the problem is not so different from that of ordinary suicide: The patient has some decent life prospects but nonetheless seeks to terminate his life. In some of the highly publicized recent cases, it has been feared that doctors have brought about death simply because the patient is suffering from intense depression.' 9 Case (6) is close to case (5), with even more features of ordinary suicide. In case (7), we may fear that medical judgments are playing an insufficiently large role in the outcome, that the case is in that sense close to ordinary suicide, or that there is too large a risk of abuse because of the absence of professional norms and professional involvement. 20 
For present purposes, let us accept the following propositions. First, it can sometimes be hard to know, in the real world, whether a case qualifies as (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6). The difficulty of making such distinctions bears on the desirability of a constitutional ruling: If apparent category (1) cases actually fall in category (6), perhaps a flat ban on physician-assisted suicide, accompanied by the good-faith exercise of prosecutorial discretion (protecting against arrests and indictments in the most excusable cases), makes a good deal of sense. Second, the state has a legitimate reason to make sure that any third party representation about the patient's wishes is actually reliable. When the patient has not consented, we have involuntary or nonvoluntary euthanasia, and it is safe to assume that the state has an especially strong interest in ensuring against involuntary or nonvoluntary deaths. 2' 
Third, and perhaps most importantly and more contentiously, let us assume that there is no constitutional barrier to laws forbidding ordinary suicide and ordinary assisted suicide, and hence that in categories (5) and (6) there is no constitutional problem.22 Let us accept this conclusion partly because of precedent23 and partly on the theory that the state has extremely strong the Right to Die, 44 AM. U. L. REv. 803, 824-25 (1995) (noting New York State Task Force on Life and the Law's opposition to physician-assisted suicide based in part on fact that majority of individuals who commit suicide suffer from depression and most doctors are not adequately trained to diagnose depression in complex cases such as terminal illness).

We do not think a State is required to remain neutral in the face of an informed and voluntary decision by a physically able adult to starve to death."); Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 68 n.15 (1973) (suggesting that laws banning suicide are constitutionally unproblematic). interests in encouraging a general commitment to the continuation of life and in protecting people from engaging in behavior that may be myopic or a product of short-term depression or distortions in judgment. Some of the strongest cases for public interference with private judgments involve myopia, cognitive error or motivational problems, or similar distortions. It is easy to imagine cases in which people facing severe temporary (or not so temporary) distress are inclined to seek a way out, and there is extremely good reason for social norms-and laws both expressing and fortifying those social norms-discouraging such people from terminating their lives. Suicide may seem the only solution to the experience of intolerable suffering, perhaps occasioned by some disastrous or life-transforming event (death of a loved one, involuntary separation, divorce); but the suffering may be far more short-term and far more remediable than it seems.2'4 The norms directed against suicide and assisted suicide have a salutary function in encouraging people to deal with even the most severe problems in a more constructive fashion; part of the salutary function of the relevant norms and laws is to block serious thought of suicide in cases where it appears to be the only or the simplest solution. In fact, it is possible that in many cases those who are "assisting" suicide are actually urging or at least legitimating it.2 A decent society seeks to inculcate a strong norm in favor of preserving life even when things seem extremely bad. It does so especially in view of the fact that suicide seems remarkably contagious. Highly publicized suicides can create bandwagon or cascade effects.26 
Of course we can also imagine cases in which a suicide may be warranted and in which assistance in suicide is morally acceptable and perhaps morally responsible, even in category (5). But in such cases, criminal prosecutions are quite unlikely, and even if there are such prosecutions, the relevant laws are generally acceptable on constitutional grounds, and that proposition is sufficient for my purposes here. I will deal, then, principally with cases falling in categories (1) and (2), for these are the most insistent ones for a constitutional "right to die." They also provide the factual settings behind both 
These points suggest a possible problem with right-to-die litigation, one that points to the distorting lens of adjudication. The particular cases brought to a court's attention will certainly be the most compelling ones. They will involve competent patients facing horrible life prospects and perhaps intense pain. A focus on the particular cases will make the right seem particularly insistent, and this will be a fully reasonable reaction to those cases. But a

SOC, REV. 340 (1974). decision in these particular patients' favor will undoubtedly affect other people not before the court, and those cases will be much more difficult. Very poignant and compelling particular cases should not be allowed to stand for the whole of the problem. 
An additional point by way of clarification: Medical practice will operate in the shadow of the law and will be influenced by the law without, however, simply tracking the law. Thus a legal system lacking an actual or formally recognized "right to die" may well make space (even quasi-official space) for physician judgments about whether to prolong life or hasten death in some quiet, not widely advertised way, usually made in close consultation with the patient and family members. For example, a doctor may administer painkillers that will make death come sooner, allow a patient not to take life-sustaining medicines or even food and water, or avoid "extraordinary" measures.27 The line between these steps and physician-assisted suicide seems thin and it is undoubtedly breached in practice. It is imaginable that patients often exercise an informal "right to die" regardless of the illegality of physician-assisted suicide. Of course the technical illegality is important; no one should feel entirely comfortable in committing an unlawful act. But the fact that social practice can outrun law is important for courts to keep in mind; it suggests that informal practice may already be creating a right where it is especially insistent, even if the law is otherwise. 28 The content of law depends not merely on the statute books but also on prosecutorial practice, and it is safe to say that in many cases prosecutors do not and will not devote their limited resources to the most benign cases of voluntary active euthanasia. The availability of informal practice and informally agreed-upon "rights" should relieve some of the pressure for a constitutional guarantee,29 at least if it appears that those rights will be recognized in some or many cases in category (1) and (2) contexts. With these notes let us now turn to the constitutional issue. 

their lives without reference to law). 
(1973), and even in places where abortion is unlawful, abortions occur, sometimes in large numbers. See CASS R. SUNSTEIN, THE PARTIAL CONSTITUTION 278 (1993). But this is not much of an argument against Roe, since the relevant abortions tend to be extremely dangerous. See id. The term "back-alley butchers" reflects the point. In the case of physician-assisted suicide, there is a weaker parallel in the informal processes I am describing. No one should deny, however, that the ban on physician-assisted suicide can produce some ugly informal outcomes. Compassion in Dying presents an example: 
When he realized that my family was going to be away for a day, he wrote us a beautiful letter, went down to his basement, and shot himself with his 12 gauge shot gun. He was 84 .... My son-in-law then had the unfortunate and unpleasant task of cleaning my father's splattered brains off the basement walls.

II. A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT? 
Under the Court's cases, the first question is whether the right to die, understood as a right to physician-assisted suicide in category (1) and (2) cases, qualifies as a "fundamental right" or "liberty interest, '"31 such that a state must show an especially strong reason for interfering with it. My ultimate suggestion is that the Court would do best to assume, without holding, that the relevant right so qualifies. Hence the discussion to follow is in a sense gratuitous; I will be arguing that the Court should put to one side the extraordinary complexities and proceed directly to the issue of justification. But the underlying issue is important, difficult, and of great intrinsic interest, and if the Court does answer the question, I suggest that it should conclude that the right to physician-assisted suicide is presumptively protected either (a) because there is a presumptive right to choose whether to live or die under medically hopeless conditions; or (b) because the cases establish a presumptive right to prevent physical invasions of one's own body, and the right to physician-assisted suicide is close enough to this established right to qualify as presumptively protected as well. 
The source of the doctrinal difficulty is that the Court has not-to say the least-given clear criteria for deciding when a right qualifies as a liberty interest. The cases leave a great deal of ambiguity and the doctrine lacks much coherence. Consider Table 1. 
Is it possible to make sense of this set of results? There are two common ways of reading the cases. One reading, which played a large role in Quill and in the Compassion in Dying dissent, is that the Court has issued a firm "no more" and is unwilling to recognize additional fundamental rights unless they find specific and extremely strong recognition in Anglo-American traditions.3 The other reading, reflected in the majority opinion in Compassion in Dying, is that the cases should be taken to establish a presumptive right to noninterference with decisions that are "highly personal and intimate, '2 especially if those decisions involve the use of one's body. Unfortunately, finds a "fundamental fight," the state may intrude only on a showing that it has chosen the least restnctive means of promoting a compelling state interest. See. e.g.. Roe. 410 U.S. at 155 It is unclear whether the identification of a "liberty interest" has the same consequence, It is notable that in Cnrzon v- Director Missouri Department of Health, the Court spoke of a "liberty interest'" rather than a fundamental nght. see 497 U.S. 261, 278-79 (1990). though it is not clear that this was intended as a distinction view: "We refer to the most specific level at which a relevant tradition protecting, or denying protection to, the asserted right can be identified." Id. at 127 n.6. Interestingly. the plurality found consistency with Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), and Eisenstadt %-Baird. 405 U.S. 438 (1972). by saying that such cases did not acknowledge "a longstanding and still extant societal tradition withholding the very right pronounced to be the subject of [the] liberty interest." 491 U.S. at 127 Thus. in those cases, there was no tradition of state enforcement of laws withholding the liberty interest "continuing to the present day" Id. This idea bears on the notion of desuetude. See infra text accompanying notes 150-52. neither of these readings holds out much promise; both are far too crude. As we will see, the "no-more-except-for-tradition" reading does not fit the cases very well, and it also lacks much appeal in principle. On the other hand, the terms "personal" and "intimate" are far too broad; they create too many ambiguities and lead in too many unhelpful directions. This is not the occasion for a full discussion of these points-I cannot attempt to sort out the modem doctrine of substantive due process in this space4-but a few notations will fundamental rights under the Due Process Clause qualify as such largely because of their origins in Anglo-American traditions, understood at a level of considerable specificity. 9 Let us for the moment assume that this is the case. If the right to physician-assisted suicide must emerge from such traditions, the case is relatively simple: There is no such right. The right to physician-assisted suicide is not something that Anglo-American law traditionally protects.' Of course suicide and assisted suicide have been banned by tradition. 5' Perhaps we could say that Anglo-American practice with respect to suicide is complex, not simple, because enforcement has often been lacking and because physicianassisted suicide is a novel phenomenon; 2 perhaps we could say that tradition yields no clear judgment that suicide is to be banned in the distinctive circumstances that we are discussing. But even if this is true, and hence the tradition does not speak with clarity, it would be implausible to suggest that our tradition affirmatively supports a right to terminate one's life with the help of a doctor. From the standpoint of Anglo-American traditions, a ban on the use of contraceptives within marriage may well count as anomalous;"' so too CONsTrrLToN (1991), which challenges traditionalism in constitutional law; JIM Balkin.

If the right to die must be rooted in tradition, then it does not qualify as a fundamental interest.5 But there are severe problems with understanding fundamental interests solely by reference to tradition, specifically described. The first problem is that many of the Court's cases cannot be understood in purely traditionalist terms, and hence the traditionalist understanding of the privacy cases fits poorly with existing law. Roe v. Wade56 is the clearest example; there is no clear tradition establishing a right to abortion. 7 But this is true not only of abortion. From the standpoint of tradition, a large number of the Court's cases make little sense. The cases establishing a right to contraceptives outside of marriage8 do not vindicate a longstanding tradition. Nor is there any general right to marry within Anglo-American traditions; hence Loving v. Virginia59 and Zablocki v. RedhaiP' fit poorly with due process traditionalism. Traditions, taken at a level of great specificity and as brute facts, do not support the right to physician-assisted suicide, but they also explain few of the key cases, and hence traditionalism does not make sense of existing law. 
Should the 
Court consider its own decisions doubtful and use traditionalism in the future notwithstanding its inconsistency with past decisions? This course, suggested by both Bowers v. Hardwick6l and the plurality opinion in Michael H. v. GeraldD.,62 might be deemed reasonable if traditionalism were extremely appealing in principle and if the alternatives were unacceptable. Perhaps a firm "no more!" would make sense despite its failure to fit with existing law; Hardwick's cavalier treatment of precedent in kind of substantive due process is legitimate, particular implies a judgment of this sort. But if we assume that at least some 63 as all of the Justices appear

history. See ELY, supra note 4, at 14-18 (arguing that interpretation of Due Process Clause as incorporating general mandate to review substantive merits of government action "not only was not inevitable, it was probably wrong"). But we might see that idea as doing the work of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, which could plausibly have been used for an enterprise of this kind. See Charles Fairman, Does the to assume, we will find large problems with using traditions, narrowly and specifically conceived, as the sole source of rights under the Due Process Clause. To be sure, such a use of tradition does help to discipline judicial discretion, and that is an important gain.64 And if traditions were systematically reliable as sources of rights, and if judges thinking more independently about the appropriate content of rights were systematically unreliable, due process traditionalism might be justified on rule-utilitarian grounds. That is, due process traditionalism might be justified as a way of minimizing aggregate judicial errors65 even if it were quite imperfect as a source of rights. 
But this is not a very plausible view, for there is no reason to think that traditions, understood at a level of great specificity, are systematically reliable or so close to systematically reliable as to exclude a somewhat more reflective and critical judicial role. 66 Anglo-American traditions, so understood, include a great deal of good but also significant confusion and injustice (consider, for example, bans on racial intermarriage); it is appropriate for courts to engage in at least a degree of critical scrutiny of intrusions on liberty even if those intrusions do not offend tradition. Nor is there sufficient reason to think that judges will inevitably do very badly if they think critically about rights. Of course judges should be very cautious about rejecting judgments made by elected officials; of course judges should avoid hubris in examining the past. Certainly it is plausible to think that judges should generally proceed incrementally and in good common law fashion from previous decisions. 67 It also makes sense to say that substantive due process should be used sparingly.68 Understandings of this kind provide important constraints on judicial power under the Due Process Clause. But at the very least it is right to ask whether the interest said to qualify as a fundamental right is, in principle, at all different from rights that have been sanctified by tradition. If, for example, there were no relevant difference, in principle, between a traditionally unrecognized right to physician-assisted suicide and (let us suppose) a traditionally recognized right to resist treatment, courts should not say that the latter is constitutionally protected and the former is not.

877 (1996) (defending idea that constitutional law is form of common law). 

If tradition is not decisive, what is the source of fundamental rights for purposes of substantive due process? This is one of the largest unanswered questions in American jurisprudence, and it would be foolish to attempt a full answer here. But terms such as "intimate" and "personal" provide too little help. They tend to be conclusions masquerading as analytic devices. In any case, some of the cases deny protection to interests that seem highly intimate and highly personal; consider both Hardwick and Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas.69 Thus the Court's cases refuse to accept the view that intimate and personal decisions deserve constitutional protection as such. 
Putting previous cases to one side, we can see that some decisions that seem intimate and personal are not strong candidates for constitutional protection; consider the decision to work longer than the maximum hour laws allow in order to provide for one's family, the decision to take medicines or drugs of a certain sort, the decision to marry one's cousin or aunt, or for that matter, the decision to commit suicide. Thus a reference to "intimacy" or "control of one's body" seems unhelpful. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit placed emphasis on the interest in promoting death "with dignity.'7 ยฐ There is indeed a strong political argument for a right to physician-assisted suicide grounded in this concern. But it is unclear what the notion adds to the due process argument. 
As we will see, the relevant cases seem to depend not simply on deciding that an interest has considerable importance, but also on at least implicit problems of procedural due process or equal protection, problems that suggest an underlying defect in democratic processes themselves. 7, It is extremely difficult to produce any verbal formula that is satisfactory, consistent with current law, and adequate to resolve the issue of physician-assisted suicide. For this reason, it would be best for the Court simply to assume that the right qualifies as fundamental and to proceed from there to the question of justification; 72 at least this course would make sense if the justification is sufficient, as I will argue.

minimalism in midst of complex issues of fact and value). 
But if the Court wanted to be more ambitious, it might venture a tentative alternative. The Court might say very narrowly that Cruzan should be read to recognize a presumptive right to make a choice about whether to live or die when one is suffering from a medically hopeless condition. Such a right would recognize that this choice is as central to individual selfdetermination as any that one can imagine; and if conditions are medically hopeless, it is harder, at least, to say that a state prohibition helps counteract individual irrationality. The existence of such a right would be important not only for people who are now dying but also for people not facing such conditions, who would be able to rest secure that if their condition became unbearable, they would have power to end it." Thus the Court might put to one side the issues raised by "dignity" and "intimacy" and rely instead on selfdetermination as the source of constitutional doctrine; it might conclude that whatever may fall in that category, the right to die when one is facing a terminal illness certainly does so. Such a right would also recognize that it is hard, in principle, to distinguish between withdrawal of life-saving equipment and category (1) and (2) cases,74 if we put to one side the risks of abuse discussed below. Those risks go not to the question of whether there is a right in the first instance, but to the separate issue of whether government has an adequate justification for intruding on the right. 
A narrow right of this kind would avoid many of the problems created by a general right to suicide. A large advantage of defining the presumptive right in this narrow way is that it would avoid the various puzzles created by any broader reading of the privacy cases. Perhaps the principal difficulties with such a definition are that the term "medically hopeless" is vague, the notion of "self-determination" leaves many open questions, and the line between terminal and nonterminal illnesses can be indistinct in practice. 
Suppose that the Court sought to be more ambitious and to introduce somewhat more order to the cases. It could find a principle of some appeal, and considerable consistency with the cases, if it said that there is a presumptive right against government authorization of nontrivial physical invasions into a person's body. A government authorization may be found when the law allows invasions by government officials or when law forbids people from fending off physical invasions by private persons. This basic idea-intended as a statement of a sufficient, if not necessary, condition for a fundamental interest-explains the notion that people have a presumptive right Missouri Department of Healih,497 U.S. 261, 296-97 (1990) (Scalia. J..concumng) This claim does not. however, mean that the distinction fails rationality review. See infrSaubsection IV B I to resist the involuntary administration of drugs.75 It accounts for the widespread intuition that there would be serious constitutional issues if the government undertook medical experiments on people against their will or required them to have operations for their own good. It helps account for Cruzan as well, though the Court did not announce a general right against physical invasions of a person's body. 
Less obviously, the standard helps explain both Roe v. Wade and the cases involving governmental efforts to prevent people from diminishing risks of pregnancy. In these cases, the government is preventing people from taking steps to prevent a physical invasion of their bodies via pregnancy. The key point, then, is that a pregnancy is a physical invasion, and if government wants to prevent people from fending off that invasion, it needs a special justification.76 A particular advantage of the standard is that it helps explain why the Court has struck down laws involving contraception and abortion without saying that there is a right to engage in sexual activity as such; the Court has been careful to say that the Constitution does not prohibit laws forbidding fornication and adultery,77 and it has restricted its holdings to state efforts to control fornication and adultery indirectly by creating a risk of pregnancy. The suggested standard thus distinguishes Hardwick,on the ground that there is no prohibition on the regulation of sexual conduct if pregnancy and childbirth are not at risk. In any event, the standard seems to provide a sufficient if not necessary condition for constitutional concern; there do not appear to be any cases that fail to find a constitutionally protected interest in cases in which the standard is met.78 
Of course this standard does not answer all imaginable questions, and this fact argues against its judicial adoption in a case that does not require the Court to attempt to make sense of its privacy doctrine, which undoubtedly consists of a number of incompletely theorized judgments 79 not easily reconciled with one another. The notion of "physical invasion" is vague. We state to administer antipsychotic drugs to prisoner against his will despite significant liberty interest in avoiding such administration of drugs). 
full defense of Roe v. Wade. See EILEEN L. MCDONAGH, BREAKING THE ABOTON DEADLOCK (1996). for an effort to defend Roe in these terms. Note also that it is possible to think that any physical invasion is legitimate either because the invasion is the product of the woman's voluntary actions or because protection of the fetus counts as sufficient justification. These points bear on the question of whether government may intrude on the right as I have understood it. 
498-99 (1965) (Goldberg, J., concurring). 
is misleading. The suggested standard is about literal invasion, not about confinement. In any case, it is well understood that the state needs a strong justification for depriving people of liberty; violations of the criminal law ordinarily provide that justification. 
CONFLICT 35-61 (1996); and Cass R. Sunstein, Incompletely Theorized Agreements, 108 HARV. L. REV. 1733 (1995). can start with core or defining cases in which government officials or private actors are authorized literally to invade bodily space-Cruzanand Washington v. Harper ยฐ are examples-but hard questions can easily be imagined, in which it is unclear whether there is a physical invasion.8 ' Some of the modem due process cases finding fundamental rights do not meet the standard; the right to marry"2 and the right to live with one's grandchild13 are examples. Moreover, I have not explained what is special about the physical invasion of one's own body. The best answer might begin with an understanding of the time-honored nature of that right in Anglo-American law; tradition affords a special place to the individual's right to prevent invasion of his body. The right to self-defense can itself be understood in these terms. Even if tradition is not decisive, for reasons suggested above, it plainly matters under existing law, and it tends to support the right described here. Tradition aside, protection of one's body against external intrusion provides the most primitive and basic sense of personal security and independence. In this way, the right to prevent physical invasions can be seen as the most central and defining case of a series of familiar rights, including the right to private property itself.84 
Does this standard support the right to physician-assisted suicide? Understood minimally, the standard seems not to create any such right. In such cases, the state is attempting to prevent a physical invasion. It is not itself undertaking a physical invasion, or making it impossible for people to stop a physical invasion from other private parties. Instead, the government is attempting to forbid people from allowing their bodies to be physically invaded. Thus the suggested standard seems to create a right to withdraw lifesaving equipment without creating a right to physician-assisted suicide. But there are two problems with this conclusion. First, as discussed above, some cases find a fundamental right even without a bodily invasion. Second, the distinction between withdrawal of life-saving equipment and physician-assisted suicide raises some serious conceptual issues, involving perhaps intractable distinctions between actions and omissions. Does it make sense to say that people have a constitutional right to resist physical invasions without also saying that they have a constitutional right to bring about physical invasions? In other words, we might say that the former implies the latter, so that people have a presumptive right to decide whether or not their bodies will be (Vol. 106: 1123 physically invaded. A strong commitment to autonomy might well lead in this direction. 5 But this idea seems far too broad as a matter of both settled law and basic principle. It would draw into question, for example, much of the activity of the Food and Drug Administration, which is precisely in the business of deciding what sorts of things may be ingested. Much criminal law also forbids people from allowing certain invasions of their body; consider laws forbidding use of addictive substances. The broader standard also appears to imply an expansive right to sexual autonomy, one that extends far beyond existing doctrine. We may conclude that the right to prevent physical invasions has some appeal but has the disadvantage of leaving open many questions, while the right to decide whether to allow physical invasions lacks both consistency with precedent and much appeal on the merits. 
From these points, several alternatives are available to the Court. First and simplest, the Court might say that it need not decide whether the right to physician-assisted suicide qualifies as fundamental for constitutional purposes and proceed from that point to assess the state's justifications. Second, the Court might hold that its decisions protect rights vindicated by tradition and at most involve a right to prevent physical invasions and do not extend to other kinds of decisional autonomy, even when the body is directly involved. But this approach has the disadvantage of failing to account for some key cases. It also fails to explain why so sharp a distinction should be drawn between removing life-sustaining equipment and administering a drug that hastens death. As we shall see, a distinction of this kind is reasonable if we focus on the potential for abuse; but at the level of presumptive rights, it is much harder to defend. In any case, it seems odd to say that this vexed and controversial distinction can support the momentous difference between rational basis review and something like the "compelling interest" standard. 
Third, the Court might say more narrowly that there is, under medically hopeless conditions, a presumptive right to decide whether one will continue to live. Fourth, and more broadly, the Court might say that the cases recognize a presumptive right to protection against physical invasion of one's body. It might add that it is not easy, in principle, to distinguish between the right to prevent bodily intrusions and the right to physician-assisted suicide, because that latter right is so obviously central to a person's most fundamental and apparently self-regarding judgments about the ultimate direction of his life, and because it is hard to explain why a person should have a constitutionally protected interest in withdrawing life-saving equipment without also having of autonomy as matter of policy). such an interest in terminating his life through "more active" means. ' On this view, the state must therefore meet a severe burden if it seeks to intrude on those judgments. Because of the difficulties associated with the various alternatives, it would probably be best for the Court to take the first route, to assume that the right to physician-assisted suicide qualifies as fundamental, and to proceed from there with the issue of justification. This is the course suggested by Cruzan.s7 
III. STATE JUSTIFICATIONS 
Suppose that the right to physician-assisted suicide does or is assumed to qualify as a fundamental interest for constitutional purposes. From this point it should not be concluded, in mechanical fashion, that any state intrusion is unacceptable. The Court should say, as it did in Adarand Constructors,Inc. V. Pena,8 that "strict scrutiny" need not be "'fatal in fact."' 9 The Court should require a strong demonstration that the interference is reasonable, without having to be persuaded that it actually agrees with the enacting legislature. 9ยฐ Does the state have a sufficient reason to interfere with that interest? There are several possible grounds." I outline them here, not to endorse them, but to suggest what reasonable people might say on behalf of the ban on physician-assisted suicide. The broadest point is that autonomy, rightly conceived, does not entail respect for all "choices"; sometimes the right to choose can diminish autonomy by subjecting people to novel pressures and influences. 
Depression,Distress, and Distorted Judgment 
People who are in intense pain or emotional distress, and who face a bleak future, may well be unlikely to think clearly. They may be deeply depressed or myopic; short-term distress may overwhelm their judgment. We could easily imagine that people who are or appear to be terminally ill might be facing the equivalent of duress. In these circumstances, a right to die might be denied as a way of protecting people against their own distorted judgment. As I have suggested, the ban on suicide itself is best justified in these terms. but noting that state may nonetheless have sufficient grounds to interfere with that interest) 
forms, that view is rooted in considerations that are essentially religious in nature and therefore an illegitimate basis for upholding a law. In nonreligious forms, the idea is hard to understand independently of the considerations discussed in the text. long as possible; family members may believe that this is a situation of great tragedy, difficulty, and expense, and that it will be much better when it is over. Here too a right to die may seem the simplest solution while more difficult approaches would be better for all concerned. 
Of course we can imagine situations in which the patient freely agrees with the family on this point. But it is also possible to foresee situations in which the patient, having been granted a "right to die," bows to the family's wishes and hence very much regrets the fact that he has that right.95 If there is a right to physician-assisted suicide, the social meaning of a refusal to terminate one's life would be very different from what it now is. Perhaps this would be an acceptable situation. But since it is, after all, the patient's life that is on the line, we can imagine reasonable people thinking that the right to die should be rejected because it actually threatens to decrease patient autonomy in too many cases. 
Physician-assisted suicide may in practice increase the authority of physicians rather than the autonomy of patients. 96 Suppose that a patient is confronted with a list of options from a doctor, one of which includes physician-assisted suicide. In some such cases the patient--confused or not-might feel actual or implicit pressure to accept the option of death. This is not because this option is, all things considered, the patient's preferred one, but because the physician explicitly or implicitly favors it and because, under the circumstances, the physician has assumed the role of an authority figure. Once a right is granted, real-world physicians may (consciously or unconsciously) favor death for any number of reasons, including financial pressures and the need to allocate scarce time to other, more promising cases. People who are poor, undereducated, or otherwise disadvantaged may be especially vulnerable to pressure. Here, too, we have a case in which a ban on physician-assisted suicide supports rather than undermines autonomy. It is relevant here that in the Netherlands, the only nation to legalize physicianassisted suicide, there are many allegations that patient consent is not always the precondition for medical decisions. 97 One observer claims, "Euthanasia, do so, and in such cases the right might undermine their autonomy. It is unlikely. however. that a large percentage of abortions results from these pressures as a matter of fact. If the percentage were in fact large. the argument for the right to abort would be undermined. 
discrimination, on the apparent theory that a legal barrier enabled them to do what they wanted to do and in that way increased their autonomy. See Lawrence Lessig. The Regulation ofSocial Aleaning. 62 U. CliI. L. REV. 943, 965-67 (1995) (discussing how Civil Rights Act of 1964 protected desires of restaurants by changing "social meaning" of nondiscrimination). Like a right to discriminate, a right to die could decrease autonomy, by pressuring patients to submit to social norms and familial desires. 
advocated and instituted to foster patient autonomy and self-determination, has actually increased the paternalistic power of the medical profession."9 8 
Many critics of the "right to die" believe that there is an easy slippage from voluntary to nonvoluntary euthanasia. Their argument has two forms. 99 Some people believe that the safeguards designed to ensure a trustworthy expression of the patient's will cannot be held in place-that in a number of cases, those safeguards will, as an empirical matter, prove inadequate, and the patient will be killed despite his wishes. Other people do not stress this empirical possibility but urge instead that if doctors are put in a position to honor the suicide requests of (autonomous) patients, the doctors will also inevitably be making some evaluation of whether those patients' lives will be worth living. Once doctors begin to make that evaluation, they will, in practice, be making judgments about the competence of patients and the value of their lives, and in some number of cases will ultimately terminate lives partly or patients. oยฐnยฐ the basis of their own judgments rather than those of their mostly 
The experience in the Netherlands is complex, but it is taken by reasonable people to signal a warning on this front.'0' A comprehensive survey suggested that of 130,000 people who died each year, 49,000 raised issues of whether to withdraw life-saving equipment or hasten death, and about 400 cases amounted to assisted suicide.1t 2 There were 9000 annual requests for euthanasia; of these, voluntary euthanasia-"any action that intentionally ends the life of someone else, on the request of that person"-was allowed in 2300 cases, or about one-quarter. In 8100 cases, doctors intended to hasten deaths via pain-killing drugs. 0 3 Some people believe that abuse has been extensive, in the form of deaths that did not receive adequate consent) ยฐ4 Thus, of the 8100 cases involving pain-killing drugs designed to hasten death,

5508 involved no explicit request on the patient's part.' One observer suggests that "the Dutch euthanasia experience lends weighty support to the slippery slope argument .... Within a decade, the so-called strict safeguards against the slide have proved signally ineffectual; non-voluntary euthanasia is now widely practiced and increasingly condoned in the Netherlands."'' 06 Others disagree." 7 The existence of uncertainty on the question suggests that there is at least a significant possibility of abuse. 
Some people undoubtedly support the prohibition on suicide and assisted suicide because of the expressive value of the prohibition.' That is, a ban on suicide may be supported as an intrinsic good insofar as it reflects social attitudes about the sanctity of life.' 9 Perhaps it is inadequate to defend a law intruding so deeply on patient autonomy on purely expressive grounds. But less controversially, it might be suggested that the ban has expressive value insofar as it has salutary effects on social norms-helping to create a culture in which life is seen with a degree of reverence, and in which the termination of life, by self or others, is taken to be a tragic event. This point has special importance insofar as a prohibition on suicide and assisted suicide, even in the most compelling cases, helps express and fortify norms in favor of dealing with difficult conditions in more constructive ways. A right to physicianassisted suicide might be taken to compromise the general social norm against suicide and assisted suicide, even if, as a technical matter, it applies only in a restricted and compelling context. We have seen that acts of suicide can be contagious."0 The state may want to disallow physician-assisted suicides for fear that a few highly publicized cases may spur a wide range of additional cases, with harmful effects on norms against suicide in general."' 
It is also possible that a right to physician-assisted suicide would have adverse effects on the norms and role of physicians. Physicians are now faced with an entrenched norm in favor of the preservation of life. A right to physician-assisted suicide might have harmful effects on that norm. It is possible, for example, that such a right would make doctors more willing to hasten death whether or not this is actually the patient's choice. Such a right

Phillips, supra note 26, at 341-42 (discussing relation between suicides and knowledge of other sutcides) may encourage physicians to make personal or cost-benefit judgments that disserve many patients' interests. The ban on physician-assisted suicide is, on this view, intended to serve an expressive function, fortifying social norms associated with the proper role of the physician. 
IV. CONSTITUTIONAL OPTIONS 
We have now seen that the state can invoke some powerful justifications to oppose the right to physician-assisted suicide. In light of these considerations, how might the Court resolve the question of whether there is a constitutionally guaranteed right to die? I believe that the Court should reject the constitutional challenge, partly for institutional reasons connected with the limited place of the Supreme Court in American government:" 2 When the issue is very close in light of the underlying issues of fact and value, and when there is no democratic defect in the underlying political process, the Court should not strike down reasonable legislative judgments. I consider substantive due process, equal protection, and (following the lead of Judge Guido Calabresi in Quill) the form of procedural due process involving the defect known as "desuetude." 
Like the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the Supreme Court might say that there is a fundamental liberty interest in deciding whether to live or die and that the various state justifications are not sufficient to overcome that interest. It might support this view with the plausible suggestion that the various risks can be counteracted through less restrictive alternatives. A state concerned about those risks might take steps to make sure that the patient really wants to die by requiring a certain burden of proof, ensuring that the circumstances meet certain constraints, imposing procedural safeguards of various kinds, and using the criminal law against doctors who pressure patients and do not simply follow their wishes. This approach would be reminiscent of Roe in the sense that it would follow the familiar two-step process of finding a fundamental right and declaring that the state does not have a "compelling" interest that it is unable to support with less restrictive means. 
This route would not be entirely indefensible. At least if we have a category (1) or category (2) case-the patient's wishes are clear, the condition is genuinely hopeless, and the patient is facing physically difficult circumstances-reasonable people might believe that the state's interests are not overriding. Perhaps the basic risks could be adequately handled through procedural safeguards (as I believe is likely true as a matter of policy). Indeed, it is possible to think that such a route would be stronger than that in several of the privacy cases, including Roe itself. Here the individual interest may be at least as insistent and the countervailing interests might seem weaker insofar as the individual in question has extremely poor life prospects. There is no direct argument, as there is in the abortion context, about preventing harm to third parties. The Court has almost never said that a state can intrude on a right that qualifies as fundamental, and unlike the procedural rules upheld in Cruzan, the barrier to physician-assisted suicide is a total ban. 
But vindication of the right would not, all things considered, be a good resolution. The privacy cases are actually far narrower than this two-step process suggests, and the Court might reasonably seek to cabin those cases by taking account of their distinctive features. Those features very much involve problems with democratic deliberation. First, equal protection dimensions-themselves calling up democratic concerns connected with political inequality-were present in many of these cases. Roe was in important part a case of gender equality, as then-Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested in 1985113 and as the Court has since explicitly acknowledged."' If that decision is to be made acceptable, it must be partly because of the connection between sex equality and the abortion right.' 5 Nor was this only true of Roe. In privacy cases involving a right of use or access to contraceptives," 6 there was at least a tacit equal protection dimension as well, for women were particularly at risk in the event of an unwanted pregnancy. It does not require much imagination to see this point. When discrimination of this kind is involved, the interest in democratic deliberation legitimately calls for a larger judicial role so as to counteract predictable problems with ordinary majoritarian processes. 
Second, as Alexander Bickel suggested long ago, the early cases raised questions of procedural due process, for they involved laws that were practically unenforced and unenforceable." '7 Thus the ban on the use of contraceptives within marriage was not a simple invasion of privacy; it involved a statute enacted long ago, not plausibly representing the considered judgments of the relevant electorate, and enforced only in a selective and discriminatory manner." 8 In this sense, the ban presented a case of desuetude." 9 The other privacy cases did not vindicate a broad right to control one's body. They suggested more narrowly that if a state is going to regulate sexual activity, it must do so directly and not through the indirect, at best modestly effective means of making pregnancy the price of that activity. We may thus conclude that the privacy cases did not involve a simple identification of a fundamental right and a judgment that the state lacked sufficient justification to intrude. There were important issues relating to procedural due process and equal protection as well. And these issues suggest that there were problems in the system of democratic deliberation that contributed to the outcomes in the relevant cases. Thus the Court did not announce a broad right to sexual autonomy. It said more narrowly that any intrusion on that right must be direct, nondiscriminatory, and supported by actual public judgments, rather than indirect, discriminatory, and reflecting no actual judgment from the democratic public. 
Along these dimensions, the right to physician-assisted suicide is quite different. In many cases, that right has been considered very recently in the relevant states. 120 Moreover, there is no serious equal protection dimension in these cases.' 2' No politically vulnerable group is at risk, at least not in any constitutionally pertinent sense. It does make sense to assume or say that the decision whether to live in category (1) and (2) cases implicates a fundamental interest for constitutional purposes. But the state has very strong reasons to intrude on that interest. The closest analogy may be to third-trimester abortions, where the Court did not deny that women retain a fundamental interest, but found the state's justification sufficient to support intrusion on that interest, even in the context of a near-total prohibition. 22 It is perfectly reasonable for citizens, in their capacity as voters, to conclude that state law should allow a right to physician-assisted suicide. But a decision by the Court, foreclosing diverse solutions in diverse states, would intrude into ongoing Catholic Church in preventing statutory change). 

a formal right to physician-assisted suicide; many (wealthy, well-educated) people may have something like that right even in a system in which the right is not formally recognized. But politically weak people would also be at special risk in a system recognizing such a right; the risks of abuse might well operate most strongly against members of disadvantaged groups. Hence the interest in political equality does not seem to argue in any particular direction. Note in this regard that while a slight majority of whites favor physician-assisted suicide, African Americans oppose it by more than two to one. See HENDIN, supra note 11, at 180. 
deliberative processes in circumstances in which reasonable people may differ. This is so especially insofar as the relevant judgments depend on factual issues not well-suited for judicial judgment. 
The Court might simply uphold the relevant laws. It might hold that there is no fundamental interest, for reasons discussed above. Far more promisingly, it might say that even if there is a fundamental interest, the state has sufficient reason to interfere with the choice. There is a great deal to be said on behalf of this conclusion. The distinction between withdrawing treatment and active euthanasia may not be supportable at the level of first principles; but it reflects widely held intuitions and, more fundamentally, the state's justifications for rejecting a right to physician-assisted suicide are stronger at least in degree.12 3 Thus the Court might say that the risks of abuse and misapplication are not so serious in the case of withdrawal of treatment, but that a state could reasonably decide that those risks are decisive against physician-assisted suicide. 
Moreover, recognition of the importance of the state's countervailing interests would free up state legislatures to do as they wish with a problem that is very much on the public agenda. As we have seen, the state does have powerful interests with which to counterpose the claim from decisional autonomy. 24 Notably, those interests are more powerful than in any of the privacy cases vindicating the underlying right. In Roe, the state's justification-protection of fetal life-seemed (and seems) to many quite strong; but at least there is a serious question whether, on secular grounds, fetal life deserves the same respect and concern as human life post-viability. By contrast, the potential abuses introduced by any right to physician-assisted suicide have considerable weight whatever one's convictions about foundational issues. The Court is not in a good position to know whether the likely risks are serious and whether they can be reduced sufficiently through less restrictive means. For this reason, the question is admirably well-suited to a federal system that can conduct a range of experiments. 
It should be clear that the argument I am making depends on the controversial suggestion that when there is no palpable defect in the system of 
supra note 6,at 172 ("Different persons can reasonably reach different conclusions ') democratic deliberation,1 5 courts should respect very reasonable legislative judgments even if a "fundamental interest" is at stake. 26 This view depends on two assumptions. The first is that judicial judgments about how to balance the relevant interests, especially in light of factual and predictive uncertainties, are not always reliable. Judges are aware of this point and they devise doctrines accordingly. Of course, judges have certain advantages by virtue of their insulation and their ability, perhaps, to be especially careful with respect to underlying issues of both fact and political morality. But with respect to issues of both fact and value, judicial insulation can be a disadvantage too; it can make it harder for courts to obtain relevant information, and it can make it less legitimate for judges to choose what to do in the face of factual uncertainty. Judicial insulation suggests that courts should not be too sure that they are right, 127 in the sense that they should be reluctant to overturn a legislative judgment when the balance is quite close and when there is no 2 problem in democratic deliberation.1 1 
The second assumption is that even if judges are right, they should be aware that their (by hypothesis correct) moral judgments, once announced, may not receive immediate social vindication and may instead produce something very different from what they intended. 29 This is because judicial judgments may truncate ongoing processes of democratic deliberation, and by so doing, may prove futile or even counterproductive. In the context of abortion, this is a plausible view, for the nation may well have been moving reasonably amicably toward a solution not far from Roe and reflecting deliberative 4; see alsoJORGEN HABERMAS, BETWEEN FACTS AND NORMS 266 (William Rehg trans., Polity Press 1996) (1992) (arguing against judicial paternalism); SUNSTEIN, supra note 29, at 123-61 (embracing same general view). On this view, a democratic problem exists if a right central to democracy is at issue (for example, the right to free political speech) or if a group is being fenced out of political processes through formal exclusions or, more controversially, prejudice or "animus." See Romer v. Evans, 116 S. Ct. 1620, 1627 (1996) (striking down state constitutional amendment partly because it reflects "animus"). 
It might be thought that there is such a defect in light of the fact that religious groups can block change for religious reasons, and perhaps this accounts for current practice in some states. The short answer is that this is not the sort of defect that would justify a more aggressive judicial role. Religious groups of course are entitled to participate in democratic processes, and even if there are constraints on the kinds of arguments that they are entitled to make, the arguments typically invoked against physician-assisted suicide do not run afoul of those constraints. The case is different from Griswoldv. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), where a well-organized religious minority, invoking a purely religious argument, was able to block a repeal that was very generally favored of a prohibition that was never directly enforced through the criminal law. See POSNER, supra note 118, at 324-28. 
critical fact here is that fully reasonable people might decide this issue either way, even though the Court might find one view more reasonable than the other as a matter of policy.

in producing social reform and complex effects of Roe v. Wade). compromises in various states. 3 ' Currently, the same may well be true with respect to physician-assisted suicide (or, to take an issue that is in some ways similar, the right to same-sex marriage). 131 In these circumstances, a constitutional ruling may embroil the Court in decades of political conflict. This consideration should not be decisive; if the argument for the constitutional right were compelling, as in for example Brown v.Board of Education,32 a majority or minority that rejects the right should not be allowed to exercise any kind of heckler's veto. In Brown, the existence of political inequality and racial animus suggested that possible disagreement among apparently reasonable people should not be decisive in court. But where there is no such inequality and the issue is otherwise very close, institutional considerations of this kind are relevant. 133 They suggest that if democratic processes are not malfunctioning, judges should be cautious about invoking their own moral judgments partly because of the risk of producing unfortunate and unintended consequences. 
This is not the occasion to attempt a full account of the appropriate occasions for exercising judicial power under the rubric of "substantive due process." It should be clear from what I have said thus far that most past substantive due process cases had some other element involving a democratic failure of some kind: excessive role for religious convictions in the public sphere, insufficient connection with considered public judgments, or problems of inequality and prejudice. Certainly we could imagine cases calling for substantive due process even without these elements. Suppose, for example, that government imposed a general "one family, one child" policy, or required people to have abortions, or said that randomly chosen people must give their kidneys to those who need them. The fact that these cases are so bizarrely unlikely suggests that the occasions for "pure" substantive due process will be rare indeed. Ordinarily, political safeguards are sufficient against such gross abuses, and if they are not sufficient, circumstances (underlying facts and values) are likely to be so entirely different from our own that our present (outraged, uncomprehending) view of them does not yield a strong defense of substantive due process. For present purposes the central point is that while there may be some cases in which states have no sufficiently powerful grounds But see DAVID J. GARROW, LIBERTY AND SEXUALITY 616-17 (1994) (contending that stateswould not have moved in direction set by Roe). Whether or not Roe is a good example. thepoint certainly holds in general.

Norms, 91 HARv. L. REv. 1212, 1220-28 (1978) (discussing rights that courts, for institutional reasons, underenforce). for interfering with what is properly characterized as a fundamental interest, the right to physician-assisted suicide is not such a case. 
In the context at hand, there is a further point. As least as much as Roe itself, a decision on behalf of a right to physician-assisted suicide would put the Court in the exceedingly difficult business of specifying appropriate procedures and boundary lines. It is inevitable that a judicially recognized right would have to be accompanied by guarantees designed to ensure that the patient genuinely wants to die. States that are skeptical of the underlying right would predictably devise correspondingly elaborate procedures, and hence the Court would be in the business of distinguishing between justified and unjustified measures designed to produce certainty about the patient's wishes. If a ban on suicide is permissible, the Court would have to make fine distinctions between those cases in which physician-assisted suicide is a constitutional right and those in which it is not. These considerations ought not to be decisive if the case for a constitutional guarantee is otherwise compelling. But they suggest that any such guarantee would produce not one judgment but a long line ofjudgments, not well-suited to judicial competence. The Court's difficulties with Roe in this regard counsel against a duplication of that experience. 
In Eisenstadt v. Baird,34 the Court struck down as irrational a law forbidding the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried people. The Court said that it was irrational to prohibit the distribution of contraceptives among unmarried people if such distribution was not prohibited to married people. 35 Many questions might be raised about the Court's reasoning; the state's decision was hardly irrational in the technical sense. But Eisenstadt can be understood as a rather cautious and modest ruling, one that vindicates a claim that the Court thought convincing without going so far as to announce a general "substantive due process" right to purchase contraceptives. 
Perhaps the Court might attempt to do something like this and seek a more modest approach via the generality-requiring commands of the Equal Protection Clause. The Second Circuit attempted a route of just this sort in Quill v. Vacco.136 The court noticed that New York allowed patients to order the removal of life support systems, but did not otherwise allow patients to take action to terminate their lives. This inequality, the court said, violated the Equal Protection Clause because it was "not rationally related to any legitimate state interest."'37 On this view, there is no sufficiently good reason to allow people to terminate their lives in one way while banning them from doing so in another way. Under the decision of the court of appeals, New York might be able to ban both physician-assisted suicide and removal of life support systems (though the latter step would raise substantive due process questions under Cruzan), but it may not discriminate. 
The equal protection/rationality approach has an advantage of comparative modesty; it also has a plausible antecedent in Eisenstadt. But the argument is nonetheless weak. Longstanding traditions, and many reasonable people, have distinguished between killing and letting die. 3 This distinction finds a particular instantiation in the idea that people should be allowed to remove life-saving equipment but not to kill themselves. Certainly the action/omission distinction raises many puzzles, and it is far from clear that the distinction makes ultimate sense in this context,139 but a holding that it is "irrational" runs afoul of both ordinary law and ordinary intuitions. If the distinction in this context is unconstitutional because it is irrational, it is unconstitutional in many other contexts as well. Consider, for example, criminal law's distinction between killing and letting die,' ' tort law's absence of liability for bad samaritans, 1 ' and indeed due process law's own distinction between government actions and omissions.'- 2 
There is also theoretical support for the distinction. Here are some possible grounds. Without endorsing the distinction for all purposes, we can say that someone who jumps off a building expresses contempt for his own life, whereas someone who disconnects life-saving equipment, and allows nature to take its course, expresses no such contempt. The attitude expressed by what are conventionally labelled "acts" may well be different from the attitude expressed by what are conventionally labelled "omissions." Similarly, it might seem that a doctor who assists in suicide is different from a doctor who withdraws life-saving equipment, because of the different attitudes expressed by the two acts. In any case, the right to remove life support might be rooted in a desire to allow people to prevent the government from restraining and invading their bodies against their will. The right to physicianassisted suicide is at least plausibly different on this score. I do not mean to

the general failure to assist people who will die without help. 
(holding that there is no affirmative right to action by state). endorse these points as a matter of basic principle. But if rationality review is genuinely at work, a state could allow people to terminate life support while disallowing them from asking doctors to administer life-terminating drugs. 
In my view, the more important points are empirical and pragmatic. It is reasonable to think that the risks of abuse are far greater in cases of physicianassisted suicide than in cases of withdrawal of life support. The latter set of cases is far easier to cabin; the former set raises in far more imaginable contexts the various difficulties discussed in Part I. A central reason is that the withdrawal of life-saving equipment is as a general rule far less likely to be unjustifiable-far less likely to reflect an irrational judgment by a competent patient-than is resort to assisted suicide. In the ordinary case, the withdrawal of life-saving equipment will involve a life that a patient reasonably and with adequate information wants to terminate; the act of assisted suicide far more commonly can involve a form of involuntary euthanasia, short-run distortions in judgment, or familial or physician pressure. For this reason, the distinction is an imperfect but fully reasonable proxy for (costly, imperfect) case-by-case inquiries into the reasonableness of the grounds for choosing death in particular instances. 43 
This is not to deny that withdrawal of life support raises risks of abuse as well. We can certainly imagine instances in which very dependent patients feel pressured, by family or doctors, to misstate their true wishes in the face of exceptionally expensive medical treatments. But at least some safeguard against widespread abuse comes from the very possibility that the withdrawal would produce death; these are relatively rare cases, mostly involving terrible and terminal illnesses, and allowing the withdrawal of treatment does not risk the sheer number of conceivable instances in which a right to physicianassisted suicide would produce nonautonomous or involuntary deaths, or deaths that more nearly resemble ordinary suicide. The withdrawal of treatment produces death only if the patient suffers from a fatal illness, whereas the right to physician-assisted suicide may well, in either theory or practice, apply far more broadly even if we attempt to restrict its domain.'" It is for this reason that this distinction is fully plausible as a way of attempting to protect patient autonomy and to combat risks of abuse. 45 So long as rationality review is genuinely at work, the equal protection challenge is unconvincing.

sufficiently plausible for constitutional purposes; the policy issue is different. See supra text accompanying notes 11-13; see also Orentlicher, supra note 143, at 665-66 (arguing that permitting assisted suicide in "limited" cases will bring law closer to society's moral values). 
The equal protection argument might be rooted in the "fundamental rights" branch of equal protection doctrine. In a number of cases, the Court has said that it will look skeptically at classifications that involve fundamental rights. It might be concluded that there is a fundamental interest here and that any discrimination with respect to that interest must be given a compelling justification. The distinction between refusing treatment and physician-assisted suicide is rational, to be sure, but perhaps it does not have a compelling argument on its behalf. Thus understood, the case would be like Skinner v. 
sterilization and marriage, respectively, and using the fundamental rights branch of equal protection doctrine. 
But this branch of the doctrine raises many puzzles. At least at first glance, the Equal Protection Clause creates a right to nondiscrimination; it does not create any independent "fundamental rights." The key equal protection "fundamental rights" cases involve voting,148and thus should be seen as part of democracy-reinforcing judicial review, not as a kind of junior-varsity substantive due process. It remains to be explained why Skinner and Zablocki are treated as equal protection rather than due process cases. If they are to be so treated, it is because they involve issues of discrimination as well as issues of "fundamental rights." Skinner is probably best understood as a case in which criminals of a certain social class were peculiarly subjected to the punishment of sterilization; Zablocki is best understood as a case informed and influenced by the fact that the relevant law prohibited poor people from marrying. Thus both cases can be seen as part of the general line of cases increasing judicial scrutiny where politically weak groups are at risk. The right to physician-assisted suicide does not raise problems of this sort. 
Nor is it clear what might be gained by holding some rights to be fundamental for equal protection purposes but not for purposes of substantive due process. Perhaps the idea is that the fundamental rights branch of equal protection doctrine is less intrusive than substantive due process because it leaves states more room to maneuver by permitting them to invade the relevant right so long as they do so on a nondiscriminatory basis. This is not entirely implausible; for purposes of physician-assisted suicide, the analysis in Skinner would be less intrusive than a rerun of Roe. But from the analytic point of view, it is very untidy. The state has fully reasonable grounds for allowing withdrawal of life-saving equipment while fearing the risks of abuse that might support obligations). 
Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964) (articulating one person, one vote principle). follow from a right to physician-assisted suicide. If the substantive due process argument is not convincing, the equal protection argument is unconvincing as well. 
The Court might strike down such laws unless they are a product of recent legislative deliberation on the particular issues raised by physicianassisted suicide. This is the solution favored by Judge Calabresi in his intriguing if somewhat adventurous concurring opinion in Quill. 49 Judge Calabresi's solution identifies an important and salutary theme in constitutional law, one that raises complex issues and deserves considerable attention. A large advantage of Judge Calabresi's approach is institutional. It ensures that interferences with important forms of liberty will not be based on law that lacks current political support; in that way, the approach is democracysupporting. Moreover, it does not preempt but instead catalyzes democratic processes, and in that sense reflects the courts' appropriate caution in dealing with complex ethical and factual issues. The principal problem with Judge Calabresi's approach is that the case of physician-assisted suicide does not easily fit the case of desuetude, for the "right to die" has received ample recent consideration in most of the relevant states. I conclude that the idea of desuetude is extremely important and valuable, and deserves a more prominent and explicit place in constitutional law, but that it ought not to be used to call for new legislation in Washington or New York. 
The basic argument is simple. Suppose that the relevant laws-banning people from helping in the commission of suicide-were written long ago, and suppose too that they were not specifically addressed to the problem of physician-assisted suicide. Indeed, that problem is a recent one, made available by new technologies and practices. In light of the novelty of the relevant practice, and (let us assume) the lack of legislative attention to that practice, we could imagine a state court ruling that state law bans on assisting suicide do not even cover physician-assisted suicide, on the ground that criminal statutes should be construed narrowly and not applied to a case that is so far afield from the understandings of the enacting legislature.'50 If a state court concurring in the result). 
opinion of Stevens, J.) (construing statute against ordinary language so as to avoid perceived unintended outcome); Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States, 143 U.S. 457, 472 (1892) (interpreting statute contrary to its plain meaning so as not to reach outcome likely disfavored by enacting legislature). has not so held, a federal court, faced with a due process challenge, might say something like this: 
We do not hold that a state may never forbid physician-assisted suicide. But if a state is going to forbid a decision of this kind, it must demonstrate that it has focused with some particularity on the problem and concluded that its rationale is weighty enough to override the individual's decision. An old statute banning assistance in suicide, enacted long ago in a time of different values and facts, is not sufficient. 
This may seem an exotic argument. But it has roots in the old notion of "desuetude," in accordance with which citizens may not be prosecuted under laws that were enacted long ago, are regularly violated in practice, may not connect with existing public convictions, and are enforced only on a sporadic and highly selective basis.' 5 ' The notion of desuetude does not have explicit support in the decisions of the Supreme Court. But it makes a good deal of constitutional sense. Notably, it is a form of procedural rather than substantive due process; the basic concerns are that there has been no focused legislative deliberation about the particular matter at hand and that rule of law principles are being violated in the enforcement process. A ruling of this kind is far less intrusive than one based on ordinary substantive due process principles, for it leaves open the possibility that a current legislature might resolve the matter as it chooses. And the principle does have antecedents. Many commentators have suggested that it provides a simpler and more compelling basis for 
understood to point to concerns of this sort. 
Other judge-made doctrines have, without using the name, pointed to desuetude-related concerns. In some cases, for example, the Court will uphold a statute only on the basis of a rationale actually at work in the process leading to its enactment. A merely hypothetical purpose is not enough. This was a central part of the Court's reasoning in United Stares i Virginia,'5 where the Court invalidated a same-sex program at the Virginia Military Institute on the ground that no legislature had in fact adopted single-sex education as a

J.. concurrng) ("Perhaps an actual, considered legislatie choice would be sufficient to allow this statute to be upheld. but that is a question I %ouldreserse until such a choice has been made."). way of promoting equality of opportunity and educational diversity.' 54 The Court left open the possibility that a legislature that actually operated with this purpose might be proceeding constitutionally. We can even understand Virginia as a case of desuetude, for the Court treated the relevant statute as embodying an obsolete judgment, one that had not been reaffirmed by a recent legislature operating on the basis of constitutionally legitimate principles. In cases of this kind, the Court leaves open the possibility that a statute calling for same-sex schooling, enacted on the basis of a legitimate and sufficiently weighty rationale, will in fact be upheld. 
The Court also construes ambiguous statutes so as to avoid raising serious constitutional doubts. 55 This idea has roots in the nondelegation doctrine; indeed, it can be seen as a narrow and more targeted version of the nondelegation doctrine, designed to say that the national legislature (rather than the bureaucracy) must focus specifically on the problem at hand. There is a close link with the doctrine of desuetude insofar as both doctrines are designed to ensure that the coercive power of law will be brought to bear on citizens only on the basis of a specific and focused legislative judgment to this effect. 
The void-for-vagueness doctrine is rooted in the same basic concern. 56 When the Court strikes down a statute as unacceptably vague, it leaves open the possibility that a more specific version of the legislative judgment-regulating speech or conduct-may be valid. A void-for-vagueness holding leaves that question undecided; it demands a focused legislative determination. It is notable in this regard that Roe itself was originally conceived as a void-for-vagueness case, 57 a holding that would have been far more cautious and modest than the opinion that emerged. 
In its intriguing decision in Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong,' the Court similarly held that if aliens are going to be deprived of all federal employment, it must be because of a judgment from Congress or the President, not the Civil Service Commission. The Court said that the Due Process Clause renders invalid a wholesale deprivation of employment unless a constitutionally specified official has decided that such a drastic step is desirable.' 59 The

law for vagueness). A similar idea underlies the development of death penalty doctrine. In Furman v. Georgia,408 U.S. 238 (1972), Justice White and Justice Stewart did not hold that death penalties were unconstitutional per se, but only that the death penalty had to be administered nonarbitrarily. See id. at 306-14 (White and Stewart, JJ., concurring). Once the public reaffirmed its commitment to capital punishment under more specific criteria after this form of "constitutional remand," the Court retreated. See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 179-81 (1976). 
problem with the relevant regulation was that it faced a "legitimacy deficit" because it had not been embraced by someone with adequate political accountability."' ยฐ 
All of these cases have close connections with the notion of desuetude. They suggest that a less intrusive alternative to a substantive due process holding is a conclusion that the state must show sufficient grounds, in actual democratic judgments, for an intrusion on certain interests and rights. 
As I have noted, an idea of this kind is not a version of substantive due process; it suggests instead that there is a procedural defect in the laws at hand. What would be wrong with an opinion of this sort? There is an obvious slippery slope problem. Many statutes now in operation were enacted long ago, when facts and values were different; are all such statutes unconstitutional? Surely they are not, and their longstanding character may well testify to their wisdom and good sense, not to their doubtful legitimacy. A constitutional doctrine would be absurd if it declared all old enactments void. The answer would have to be that the prohibition against desuetude applies not only when a law is very old, but also when (a) a liberty interest is at stake; (b) the rationale brought forward in the law's defense did not play any kind of role in the enacting legislature; (c) there is a demonstrated problem of sporadic and perhaps discriminatory enforcement; and (d) the relevant rationale, if supported by adequate facts and an actual legislative judgment, may well be sufficient to justify the intrusion on the liberty interest. 
But there is another objection. An approach based on desuetude puts courts in the business of setting the legislative agenda. Any legislature has a great deal to do, and its failure to alter a law involving assisted suicide may well not signify indifference or neglect, but something like a considered judgment that the status quo is acceptable. In fact, this is a reasonable view about New York itself in Quill v. Vacco.16' And if the legislature has recently considered the problem and failed to do anything new, the doctrine of desuetude probably should not apply. But for cases that involve an unusually strong liberty interest and a justification that is post hoc and of questionable relevance to any actual legislative decision, a ruling founded on desuetude makes a great deal of sense as a less restrictive alternative to an equal protection or due process ruling. It should be seen as an effort to create a more deliberative democracy, one in which certain interests can be compromised only on the basis of a recent deliberative judgment, not as a kind of accident. 
An idea of this kind provides the strongest support for Griswold itself, and, as we have seen, it is far from entirely foreign to constitutional law. But this rationale could not be used if the statute forbidding physician-assisted suicide were the product of recent and sustained legislative deliberation. Here we find the simplest response to the argument from desuetude: These are not at all cases in which states have been inattentive to the underlying issues of fact and policy. On the contrary, the issue of physician-assisted suicide has received a great deal of attention. In the state of Washington, the relevant law was enacted in 1992.162 In New York, there has been no recent legislative enactment forbidding physician-assisted suicide, but the issue has been receiving intense consideration at the highest levels of state government. Thus a new enactment specified the conditions for withdrawal of life-saving equipment as recently as 1990,63 and in 1994, a highly visible Task Force issued a report recommending that things be left as they were.164 
Judge Calabresi may be suggesting that intense consideration is not enough and that a state must not only consider a statute that raises problems of desuetude but also reenact it. t65 The apparent thought is that inertia may reflect something other than approval, and that in any case, an intense minority may be able to block consideration, in the sense of an actual vote, without being able to block enactment once a vote occurs. In some ways this is an attractive view; it suggests a possible distinction between New York and Washington. But if there is good evidence that a state government has actively and intensely considered an issue, as New York has, it seems strained to say that the Due Process Clause requires actual reenactment. The question is whether it would really make sense to invalidate the New York ban while upholding the ban in Washington, when the distinction seems relatively thin in light of the large volume of public attention given to the issue in both states. Nor is this a case like Griswold, in which a politically intense minority was able to block legislative change that was generally desired. 66 With respect to physician-assisted suicide, politically intense minorities are on all sides of the question, and no particular group faces or creates a systematic barrier to well-functioning democratic deliberation. 
I conclude, then, that the general idea of desuetude serves important constitutional values and has significant advantages over the substantive due F.3d 790 (9th Cir.), cert. granted, 117 S. Ct. 37 (1996).

only because of political power of Catholic Church). process route; that we could imagine cases involving physician-assisted suicide that would provide a good arena for invoking that idea; but that the issue has been under intense discussion in many states and that Washington and New York have had intense recent deliberations. If the Court is to accept a version of Judge Calabresi's proposal-and I believe that it ultimately should-it should do so in a simpler and more compelling setting. 
At several points I have compared the right to physician-assisted suicide with the right to have an abortion, and it will now be useful to bring together some strands of the comparison, since Roe looms so clearly in the background of the discussion of a constitutional right to die. A central distinction is that Roe is best understood as largely a case about sex equality. It was not simply a due process case, as the Court has come to recognize; it depended centrally on the fact that restrictions on the right to abort are a form of discrimination against women and closely associated with traditional and no longer legitimate ideas about women's appropriate role.167 The right to die does not have this equal protection element. 61 
Along the dimension of justification, there is also a difference between Roe and the right to physician-assisted suicide. The principal justification in Roe rested on the perceived importance of protecting the fetus. It is possible to think that fetuses are not people and that a commitment to the overriding importance of their survival depends on sectarian claims. Without defending this controversial view, we can see that a claim of this general sort underlies Roe itself. By contrast, the state's justifications for interfering with the right to physician-assisted suicide are unquestionably legitimate and largely empirical in nature. To the extent that the state is saying that it fears risks of abuse, it is able to offer a quasi-predictive defense of the sort that was unavailable in Roe. 
It also follows from what I have said thus far that the Court should be very cautious about duplicating the experience of Roe and that it is by no means clear that the broad holding of Roe was right at the time. At the very least, it is by no means clear that the Court was correct to have created so broad a right in its first confrontation with the abortion issue. The Court would have done much better to have proceeded narrowly and incrementally, and to the Court invalidated same-sex education at Virginia Military Institute. AVISHAI MARGALIT. TttE DECENTI Soct ry (1996), is, in my view, a relevant discussion of the phenomenon of "humiliation- via state channels. 
have engaged in a form of dialogue with the political process. 69 It would have done much better because it would not have caused so much destructive and unnecessary social upheaval, because it probably would have produced a range of creative compromises well-adapted to a federal system, and because a more cautious approach would not deeply have compromised the underlying right, as that right is best conceived. The Roe experience is not one that the Court should duplicate, at least when the Court's underlying judgment is subject to reasonable dispute and when there is no particular reason to distrust political processes. 
In this Essay I have made three claims. First, I have suggested that courts should be reluctant to invalidate legislation under the Due Process Clause in its "substantive" dimension when there is no defect in the system of democratic deliberation and when reasonable people might decide the underlying questions of value and fact either way. I have also suggested that this idea plays a large and underappreciated role in existing law. The key privacy cases, though decided as a matter of substantive due process, had important dimensions of desuetude and equal protection. The equal protection "fundamental rights" cases had large dimensions of democracy-reinforcement, involving as they did political rights or groups at particular risk in democratic processes. 
Second, I have argued that when conditions are, or appear to be, medically hopeless, the individual's interest in physician-assisted suicide should probably qualify as one on which the state may intrude only with special justification. But-and this is the third claim-I have also suggested that this principle should not be understood to invalidate state efforts to prevent people from taking their own lives on their own or with the assistance of others. It is not easy to decide how states should handle the forms of distress that produce requests for physician-assisted suicide; much of that distress might be alleviated by helping patients and families come to terms with the fact of death. Physician-assisted suicide creates palpable risks of abuse, and the weight to be given to these risks depends on hard predictive judgments and complex assessments of how to handle factual uncertainty. A reasonable legislature, even giving great weight to the interests of patients, might decide that those risks are sufficient to justify a prohibition. A state could decide, with reason, that a ban on physician-assisted suicide actually promotes the autonomy of many or most people and in the process has salutary effects on the norms and practices of the medical profession. Probably the simplest supra note 72, at 49-50 (criticizing Roe for its "maximalism"). opinion would assume for purposes of argument that the right to physicianassisted suicide qualifies as a "fundamental right" while finding that the state has sufficient reason to override that right. 
It is hard to be comfortable with this conclusion. In actual cases, fully competent people, joined by their loved ones, are seeking to terminate their lives amidst hopeless conditions and an inevitable period of helplessness, despair, and perhaps intense emotional or physical pain. Those of us who are healthy are likely to have known people in such situations; those of use who are healthy may eventually find ourselves in such situations. In cases of this kind, an insistence on the abstract "right to life" can seem an egregious and unnecessary cruelty, and the notion of "death with dignity" acquires immense force. Lawyers and citizens should be aware that a judgment that people have no constitutional right to commit some act does not mean that they do not deserve, in the deepest moral sense, that very right. Undoubtedly doctors should consult closely with patients, friends, and family members, and on occasion, all will conclude that physician-assisted suicide is a merciful and fully legitimate act. Sometimes they will reach this conclusion whatever the technical content of state law, and in such cases prosecutors should tread very cautiously indeed. And here we arrive at the heart of the matter. The argument I have offered is institutional rather than substantive: It is not the Supreme Court but these other arenas-state legislatures, prosecutors' offices, hospitals, and private homes-that should decide whether, when, and how to legitimate a "right to die."

Economists have invented a game: the ultimatum game. The people who run the game give some money, on a provisional basis, to the first of two players. The first player is told to offer some part of the money to the second player. If the second player accepts that amount, he can keep what is offered, and the first player gets to keep the rest. But if the second player rejects the offer, neither player gets anything. Both players are informed that these are the rules. No bargaining is allowed. Using standard assumptions about rationality, self-interest, and choice, economists predict that the first-player should offer a penny and the second player should accept. 
This is not what happens. Offers usually average between 30% and 40% of the total. Offers of less than 20% are often rejected. Often there Economics 253, 270-74, 282-88, 298-302 (John H.

Social psychologist Robert Cialdini tried to find out.3 He placed flyers under the windshield wipers of cars and waited to see what drivers would do with them. Cialdini made arrangements so that before reaching their cars, some people would see someone (a Cialdini associate) walk past them, pick up from the street a bag from a fast-food restaurant, and throw it in the trash can. Of the group who both saw the responsible behavior and noticed the flyers, almost none threw them on the street. In the control experiment, with no one showing responsible behavior, over 1/3 of the drivers threw the flyers on the street.4 
About 400,000 Americans die each year from smoking-related causes.5 Government has tried to reduce smoking through educational campaigns designed to inform people of the risks. Indeed the government has now initiated a large-scale program to reduce smoking, especially among teenagers. 6 Despite this fact, about one million Americans begin smoking each year, many of them teenagers, 7 and people worry that educational campaigns will succeed, if at all, only with well-educated people. 
But consider this. Nationally, 22.9% of white teenagers smoked in 1993, a number that basically has been unchanged in the last decade. But in the same year, only about 4.4% of African-American teenagers smoked, a number that is four times smaller than the number a decade before.8 What accounts for this difference?

In East Hampton, New York-part of the famous and wealthy "Hamptons"-what used to be called the East Hampton Dump is now the East Hampton Recycling and Disposal Center. At the East Hampton Recycling and Disposal Center, there are separate bins for green glass, clear glass, newspapers, tin cans, paper other than newspaper, and more. 
Almost every day in August (the most popular period in the Hamptons), residents can be found patiently separating their garbage for placement in the relevant bins. Sometimes this takes a long time. The people at the Center tend to own expensive cars-Mercedes Benzes, BMWs-that are parked near the bins. As they separate their garbage, they look happy.

My goal in this article is to challenge some widely held understandings of rationality, choice, and freedom, and to use that challenge to develop some conclusions about human behavior and the appropriate uses and domain of law. I particularly seek to understand and defend the place of law in "norm management." 
I urge that behavior is pervasively a function of norms; that norms account for many apparent oddities or anomalies' 0 in human behavior; that changes in norms might be the best way to improve social well-being; and that government deserves to have, and in any case inevitably does have, a large role in norm management. 1' As I will suggest, norm management is an important strategy for accomplishing the objectives of law, whatever those objectives may be. One of my goals is to show how this is SO. 
see infra Parts IV.B-C. 
great deal with objections to the use of "external preferences" as a basis for law. See Ronald Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously 240-55 (1977). I believe that there is no general objection to the use of external preferences-the use of people's beliefs about what other people's beliefs should be-and also that there is no objection to government's effort to change norms. When government attempts to inculcate an anti-littering norm, or to inculcate a norm in favor of paying taxes, its behavior is not objectionable merely because norms are being managed. Any objection, to be persuasive, depends on an argument that government is invading fights. A robust set of rights should be in place to limit norm management, see infra Part VII; but so long as it is, there should be no objection to norm management itself. Cf.Joseph Raz, Liberalism, Scepticism, and Democracy, in Ethics in the Public Domain: Essays in the Morality of Law and Politics 82, 94-98 (1994) (arguing that "external preferences" should not be automatically excluded from the political domain). Risk

Part of my motivation is therefore practical. Consider the following table:' 2 
Percent of Total Deaths (Range) 
Total Deaths/yr 
Existing social norms encourage much risk-taking behavior; and almost all of these risks of death could be much reduced with different norms. Consider smoking, diet/activity, alcohol, firearms, sexual behavior, motor vehicles, and illicit drugs as causes of death. In all these cases, new norms could save lives.' 3 A regulatory policy that targets social norms may well be the cheapest and most effective strategy available to a government seeking to discourage risky behavior. It may complement or work more efficiently than existing regulatory approaches. 
Social norms are also part and parcel of systems of race and sex equality. If norms changed, existing inequalities would be greatly reduced.14 It is thus transparently important to see whether shifts in social norms, brought about through law, might operate to save lives and otherwise improve human well-being.15 
But part of my motivation is theoretical. It involves a conceptual puzzle. In the last decade there has been an intense debate about whether and to what extent law should try to change people's "preferences.' u 6 But the term "preferences" is highly ambiguous, and it is not clear what the participants in this debate are actually disputing when they say that "preferences" should or should not be respected by law. I attempt to clarify possible meanings of the term. I also suggest that when the idea of a "preference" is unpacked, it becomes plain that the term is often too abstract and coarse-grained to be a reliable foundation for either normative or positive work. We will thus find reason to doubt the elaborate edifice of social science based on the notion of "preference." The ultimate task is to separate positive, descriptive, and normative inquiries more sharply and, in the process, to try to untangle different motivational states and their influences on choices. 
More particularly, I aim to make a set of conceptual or descriptive points: 
supposed, because they depend on social norms to which-and this is the key point-people may not have much allegiance. What I will call norm entrepreneurs-people interested in changing social norms-can exploit this fact. If successful, they produce what I will call norm bandwagonsand norm cascades.17 Norm bandwagons occur when small shifts lead to large ones, as people join the "bandwagon"; norm cascades occur when there are rapid shifts in norms. Successful law and policy try to take advantage of learning about norms and norm change. 
important and well-known anomalies in human behavior are best explained by reference to social norms and to the fact that people feel shame when they violate those norms.1 8 Thus when people deviate from economic predictions-when they appear not to maximize their "expected utility"-it is often because of norms. 
selfinterest" and social norms.' 9 Individual rationality is a function of social norms. The costs and benefits of action, from the standpoint of individual agents, include the consequences of acting inconsistently with social norms. Many efforts to drive a wedge between rationality and social norms rest on obscure "state of nature" thinking, that is, on efforts to discern what people would like or prefer if social norms did not exist. Those efforts are doomed to failure. 20 A. Posner, The Ethical Significance of Free Choice: A Reply to Professor West, 99 Harv. L. Rev. 1431 (1986).

defended as such. In that case it would be possible to say that a certain norm is irrational because (for example) it makes lives worse. "preferences,"2 1 despite the pervasiveness of that idea in positive social science and in arguments about the appropriate domains of law and the state. In normative work, the idea of "preferences" elides morally important distinctions among the motivations and mental states of human agents. In positive work, the idea is too coarse-grained, in the sense that it disregards contextual factors that produce diverse choices in diverse settings. People's choices are a function of norms, which operate as "taxes" or "subsidies"; and the content of norms depends on the context. Instead of speaking of "preferences," we might assess choice in terms of ( selfconception. 
I also aim to make two normative claims involving the appropriate domain of law. These claims have a great deal to do with law's expressive function, by which I mean the function of law in expressing social values with the particular goal of shifting social norms. 
individual choices are a function of social norms, social meanings, and social roles, which individual agents may deplore, and over which individual agents have little or no control. Norms can tax or subsidize choice. Collective action-in the form of information campaigns, persuasion, economic incentives, or legal coercion-may be necessary to enable people to change norms that they do not like. 
is appropriate for law to alter norms if they diminish well-being by, for example, encouraging people to shorten their lives by driving very fast, using firearms, or taking dangerous drugs. It is appropriate for law to alter norms if they diminish autonomy by, for example, discouraging people from becoming educated or exposed to diverse conceptions of the good. 
Libertarians, some economic analysts of law, and many liberals22 give inadequate attention to the pervasive functions of social norms, social meanings, and social roles. Often it is said that in a free society, governments should respect both choices and preferences. But the case for re21. See infra Part Im.I think that Gary Becker moves in the direction of dispensing with the idea in Gary S. Becker, Accounting For Taste (forthcoming 1996), because he disaggregates the term. I am not sure, however, that Becker would accept my characterization. 
various strands here. I believe that all of the arguments made here fit well within central strands of that tradition. For relevant discussion, see Stephen Holmes, Passions and Constraint: On the Theory of Liberal Democracy 13-41 (1995). On autonomy, see, e.g., Thomas Nagel, The View From Nowhere 113-20 (1986); Joseph Raz, The Morality of Freedom 369-99 (1986). specting these things depends partly on their consequences and genesis, and as I have indicated, the determinants of choices (indeed the very meaning of the term "preference") remain obscure. 23 We should agree that social norms play a part in determining choices; that people's choices are a function of their particular social role; and that the social or expressive meaning of acts is an ingredient in choice.2 4 Of course norms vary a great deal across cultures, and sometimes even within cultures. We should try to see when social norms, social roles, and social meanings are obstacles to human well-being, and whether something might be done to change them, even if people are making "choices," even if there is neither force nor fraud, and whether or not there is "harm to others." 
One of my central points here is that individual agents have little control over social norms, social meanings, and social roles, even when they wish these to be very different from what they are. 25 This is not an argument against norms, meanings, and roles. Human beings can live, and human liberty can exist, only within a system of norms, meanings, and roles; but in any particular form, these things can impose severe restrictions on well-being and autonomy. 
As I have suggested, agents who seek to make changes in norms face a collective action problem. For example, it is impossible for an individual to alter norms determining whether the act of smoking seems daring, or the act of recycling seems exotic, or the act of opposing sexual harassment seems humorless. This is so even though the relevant norms greatly influence behavior. If, for example, smokers seem like pitiful dupes rather than exciting daredevils, the incidence of smoking will go down. If people who fail to recycle are seen as oddballs, more people will recycle. If the role of secretary is not associated with susceptibility to unwanted sexual attention, there will be less unwanted sexual attention. The point bears very much on current public disputes. If single parenthood is stigmatized, social practices will change accordingly; if homosexual marriages are consistent with social norms, social practices will be much altered. In all of these cases, individual actors need to act together in order to produce the relevant shifts. 
More particularly, I hope to draw attention to the fact that people's conception of appropriate action and even of their "interest" is very Economics 1-90 (1993); Amartya Sen, Behavior and the Concept ofPreference, in Choice, Welfare and Measurement 54 (1982); Jean Hampton, The Failure of Expected-Utility Theory as a Theory of Reason, 10 Econ. & Phil. 195 (1994); Amartya Sen, Internal Consistency of Choice, 61 Econometrica 495 (1993) [hereinafter Sen, Internal Consistency]. 
Social Meaning, 62 U. Chi. L. Rev. 943 (1995). Though I have referred to this paper at various points, my presentation here owes a general debt to Lessig's argument and in particular to his emphasis on the collective action problem presented by social meanings. See id. at 991-1016. 
COLUMBIA LAW REEW much a function of the particular social role in which they find themselves. This is true of (for example) judges, lawyers, doctors, parents, children, waiters, wives, husbands, colleagues, friends, and law school deans. Attention to the place of social role shows that for many purposes, the contrast between "rationality" and social norms 26 is unhelpful. What is rational for an agent is a function of, and mediated by, social roles and associated norms. 27 And when social norms appear not to be present, it is only because they are so taken for granted that they seem invisible. 
At the same time, norms and roles-operating as taxes on or subsidies to action-can create a division between the judgments and desires that are displayed publicly and the judgments and desires that would be displayed without current norms and roles. 28 People's private judgments and desires diverge greatly from public appearances. For this reason current social states can be far more fragile than is generally thought-small shocks to publicly endorsed norms and roles decrease the cost of displaying deviant norms and rapidly bring about large-scale changes in publicly displayed judgments and desires. Hence societies experience norm bandwagons and norm cascades. Norm bandwagons occur when the lowered cost of expressing new norms encourages an ever-increasing number of people to reject previously popular norms, to a "tipping point" where it is adherence to the old norms that produces social disapproval. 29 Norm cascades occur when societies experience rapid shifts toward new norms.3 0 Something of this kind happened with the attack on apartheid in South Africa, the fall of Communism, the election of Ronald Reagan, the use of the term "liberal" as one of opprobrium, the rise of the feminist movement, and the current assault on affirmative action. 
Cement of Society]. It might be possible to define rationality in a way that abstracts from social norms, seeJon Elster, Norms ofRevenge, 100 Ethics 862, 872-76 (1990) [hereinafter EIster, Norms of Revenge], but it would be hard to make robust predictions on the basis of any such definition. The problem lies in a norm-free specification of the "ends" that rational actors pursue. If we understand rationality in purely instrumental terms, we will be unable to make any predictions at all; if we understand it in purely economic terms, we will find much social irrationality and hence make bad predictions, and in any case the pursuit of wealth will inevitably have some relation to social norms. (Elster sees revenge behavior as inconsistent with rationality, but individuals who seek revenge get hedonic benefit from getting revenge. Hence Elster's conception of rationality is normatively invested in a way that seems plausible but needs defense, and that in any case is designed for normative rather than positive purposes.)

Pol. Econ. 992 (1992) (explaining how informational cascades can contribute to the rapid spread of new behaviors). 
To spell out the most general point emerging from the discussion: The notion of a "preference" can be deeply confusing, and in many of its uses, it impairs both positive and normative analysis of law. In its standard form, a preference is supposed to be something that lies behind choices and that is more abstract and general than choices are.3 1 But what lies behind choices is not a thing but an unruly amalgam of things3 2-aspirations, tastes, physical states, responses to existing roles and norms, values, judgments, emotions, drives, beliefs, whims. The interaction of these forces will produce outcomes of a particular sort in accordance with the particular context. Hence we might say that preferences are constructed, rather than elicited, by social situations3, 3 in the sense that they are very much a function of the setting and the prevailing norms. 
This point bears on the role of government, which cannot avoid affecting social norms. A market economy will, for example, have predictable effects on norms, 3 4 and historically it has been justified on just this ground, as a way of softening social divisions by allowing people to interact with one another on a mutually beneficial basis.3 5 A good deal of governmental action is self-consciously designed to change norms, meanings, or roles, and in that way to increase the individual benefits or decrease the individual costs associated with certain acts. Thus government might try to inculcate or to remove shame, fear of which can be a powerful deterrent to behavior. The inculcation of shame operates as a kind of tax; the removal of shame might be seen as the elimination of a tax or even as a kind of subsidy. 
There is a thin line between education and provision of information on the one hand and attempted norm-change on the other. In fact we will see that in the process of norm management, government has a Treatise on the Family (enI. ed. 1991). For Becker's most recent statement-which is, I believe, in a somewhat different spirit-see Becker, supra note 21. 
in The Essence of Becker 633, 633 (Ram6n Febrero & Pedro S. Schwartz eds., 1995) ("An important step in extending the traditional theory of individual rational choice.., is to incorporate into the theory a much richer class of attitudes, preferences, and calculations."). 
(arguing that preferences are shaped by situation-specific cognitive processes). I mean to use the idea of construction somewhat more broadly than does Slovic.

Ross, Reputations Versus Labels: The Power of Situational Effects in the Prisoner's Dilemma Game (1993) (unpublished manuscript); see also Lee Ross & Andrew Ward, Naive Realism: Implications for Social Conflicts and Misunderstandings in Values and Knowledge (Terrance Brown et al. eds., forthcoming 1996). 
number of tools. In a democratic society, it ought to be willing to use them. 
This Article comes in seven parts. Part II discusses the basic concepts: social norms, social roles, and social meanings. Part III explores the relationship between preferences and choices; it explains the limited usefulness of the idea of "preferences." Part IV places special emphasis on the role of pride and shame in human behavior. Part V offers some general comments on the role of government in altering norms. Part VI explores more particular bases for governmental or legal action. It shows how government might overcome collective action problems, diminish risk, and enhance autonomy through managing norms. Part VII briefly describes when and why government action may be illegitimate or illadvised. 
In this section I discuss three ideas that will play an important part throughout this Article: social norms, social roles, and social meanings. Social norms are the most central of these, since they provide the foundation for both social roles and social meanings. I also connect these ideas to problems of collective action, movements for legal and social change, and some issues about the goals and functions of law. 
A. Social Norms 
many different ways.3 6 For present purposes the differences among the possible definitions are not very important, and we can rely on conventional understandings. If a definition is thought necessary, we might, very roughly, understand "norms" to be social attitudes of approval and disapproval, specifying what ought to be done and what ought not to be done. Some norms set good manners, for example, about how to hold one's fork; others reflect morally abhorrent views, as in the taboo on interracial relations; others reflect hard-won moral commitments, as in the norm against racial epithets. In fact there are social norms about nearly every aspect of human behavior. There are norms about littering, dating, smoking, singing, when to stand, when to sit, when to show anger, when, how, and with whom to express affection, when to talk, when to listen, when to discuss personal matters, when to use contractions, when (and with respect to what) to purchase insurance. 
possible and many useful distinctions might be drawn. See, e.g., Elster, Norms of Revenge, supra note 26, at 863-66; Philip Pettit, Vius Normativa: Rational Choice Perspectives, 100 Ethics 725, 728-32 (1990); see also H.LA. Hart, The Concept ofLaw 82-91 (2d ed. 1994) (discussing rules of obligation, a subclass of norms); David K. Lewis, Convention 99-100 (1969) (dealing with the relation between conventions and norms). "It isn't done" is a frequent reaction to certain disapproved conduct37-even though the relevant "it" is indeed done. The governing attitudes span an exceptionally wide range. They may or may not begin or maintain themselves as a result of reflective judgments about, for example, fairness and utility.38 They may be based on simple, intuitive judgments about what is healthy behavior; these judgments may eventually turn into moral commitments unmoored from health judgments. Social norms may or may not promote liberty and well-being; they may or may not be easily malleable or go very deep into people's understandings. Sometimes norms are codified in law.3 9 This is true, for example, with norms governing littering, respecting private property, and banning discrimination on the basis of race or sex. 
Whether or not law is also at work, social norms are enforced through social sanctions that are, to say the least, pervasive. "Political correctness" is no isolated phenomenon. It is ubiquitous. 40 It occurs whenever reputational incentives impose high costs on deviant behavior. The relevant sanctions create a range of unpleasant (but sometimes pleasant) emotional states in people who have violated norms. If someone behaves in a way inconsistent with social norms, public disapproval may produce embarrassment or perhaps shame and a desire to hide. Sometimes the unpleasant feelings brought about by violations of social norms are intense, and the social consequences of these feelings, and (perhaps even more) of anticipating them, can be substantial.4' 
discussion, see Elster, The Cement of Society, supra note 26; Allan Gibbard, Wise Choices, Apt Feelings: A Theory of Normative Judgment (1990); Cristina Bicchieri, Norms of Cooperation, 100 Ethics 838 (1990). Nor do I discuss the relationship between social norms and moral judgments about, for example, fairness. Social norms are sometimes supported by such judgments, but sometimes not. Social norms are sometimes a product of such judgments, but sometimes not. On the relation between behavior and judgments about fairness-more precisely, in my view, social norms rooted in judgments of fairnesssee Daniel Kahneman et al., Fairness and the Assumptions of Economics, in Richard H. Thaler, Quasi Rational Economics 220 (1991).

certain views as weak followers of convention, rather than people who are following moral convictions of their own. If one believes that one's own views are "politically correct," one is likely to feel a bit embarrassed by them; if one thinks that one is avoiding "political correctness," one is likely to be proud ofone's independence and fortitude. Consider the suggestion that "[a] lot of young women don't want to be called feminists because, hey, listen to Rush Limbaugh, and you've heard it all. It's equated with being lesbian, fat, ugly."

Much socially desirable behavior is attributable to social norms. For example, lack of education produces a good deal of shame in certain communities; so too with the decision to be promiscuous, or to use alcohol, cigarettes, or unlawful drugs. The result can be salutary incentives. But social norms can produce undesirable incentives as well. Thus, in some communities, norms encourage a lack of education, promiscuity, or abuse of alcohol or unlawful drugs. 
points we might conclude that choice among options is a function not only of (a) the intrinsic value of the option-a book, ajob, a drink-but also of (b) the reputational benefit or cost of the choice and of (c) the effects of the choice on one's self-conception. 42 The intrinsic value refers to whether, apart from reputational effects or effects on the agent's selfconception, the option is fun, illuminating, pleasant, interesting, and so forth. You may watch a television show on public broadcasting not only because it is fun or illuminating, but also because there are reputational advantages from doing so and advantages as well from the standpoint of enhancing your self-conception. Someone may buy a certain book (say, a book about Shakespeare) and not another book (say, a book by Stephen King) largely because she wants to think of herself as the sort of person who reads about Shakespeare. Someone may buy and wear an expensive piece of clothing not only or not mostly because he thinks it looks nice, but also or mostly because he wants other people to see him wearing that piece of clothing. Social norms are a key determinant in reputational benefit or cost. They can much affect (though they need not determine) self-conception as well. I 
Changes in social norms can influence choices if intrinsic value is held constant, by altering the effects of reputational incentives and consequences for self-conception. 43 If littering produces shame or disapproval, behavior will shift; if race discrimination produces reputational cost rather than benefit, fewer people will discriminate on the basis of race; if parenthood out of wedlock is stigmatized, there should be less parenthood out of wedlock.44 Indeed, obedience of law is built in large here. Kuran discusses reputational and intrinsic utility; he also refers to what he calls "expressive utility," by which he means the expressive value of the act. See id. at 30-35. Some people may, for example, want to deviate from existing norms because of the expressive value of deviation. But I think it is better to speak of effects on the agent's selfconception; this isa more general idea that includes, but isnot limited to, what Kuran calls expressive value. 

Community 112-37 (1990) (describing impact of social norms on patterns of childbirth and parenting). part on the perceived reputational consequences of law violation. 45 Of course those consequences might be favorable rather than unfavorable. 
The three-part division is a bit crude, since perceptions of intrinsic value will be often a function of social norms. Those perceptions do not exist in a vacuum. Perceived intrinsic value is emphatically a result of social forces-consider responses to opera, rock music, rap-and reputational pressures can interact in complex ways with beliefs about intrinsic value. People's self-conceptions are very divergent, and each of our selfconceptions has many dimensions; for example, many of us may want not to be conformists, but also want not to diverge too much from what other people do and think. I offer the three-part division as a place to start. 
understood very broadly as the power to do whatever one would like to do.46 Certainly norms stop people from doing things that (if the norms were different) they would like to do, and people sometimes would like the norms to change. In particular, norms can drive a wedge between people's public actions or statements and their private judgments or desires. 47 Some people very much want norms to be something other than what they are, and they regret the fact (if they recognize it) that they have no power to change them. Thus a teenager might lament the existence of social norms in favor of (say) carrying a firearm or using drugs; but while the norms are in place, he might well carry a firearm and use drugs, and in a sense feel compelled to do so. 
It would, however, be quite ludicrous to deplore social norms, to see them only as constraints on freedom, or to wish for them to disappear. In fact norms make freedom possible. Social life is not feasible-not even imaginable-without them.48 In the absence of social norms, we would be unable to understand one another.4 9 Norms establish conventions about the meanings of actions. Social norms are thus facilitative as well as constraining.5 0 If everyone knows the norms concerning a raised voice or wearing bluejeans, then people can raise their voices or wear bluejeans without having to decide what these actions mean. 
correlation between fear of peer disapproval and compliance). 
things-like speed limit laws or high prices-reduce freedom, thus understood. I seek only to draw attention to the fact that norms can constrain behavior and choice even though some or many people would like them to be otherwise. 

social norms are different in different cultures, so that meanings have to be translated, and people may be unaware of that fact. Consider the example of whistling at sporting events: In America, whistling connotes approval; in Europe, it is a form of "booing." governance). [Vol. 96:903? 
There is a further and, for present purposes, an especially important point. Good social norms solve collective action problems by encouraging people to do useful things that they would not do without the relevant norms.5 1 Consider voting, littering, behaving courteously, keeping promises, cleaning up after one's dog, writing tenure letters, and doing one's share of administrative work. Without social norms, coercion or economic incentives-perhaps with large financial investments-would be required to solve collective action problems. Norms can be an especially cheap way of ensuring against the unfortunate consequences of prisoner's dilemmas. 
On the other hand, social norms may be ineffective. This is so partly because some people like to incur the disapproval that follows norm-violation, and hence some people like to "flout convention" by rejecting prevailing norms by, for example, smoking, playing loud music in public, or wearing unusual clothes. Of course people who violate generally held social norms might be behaving consistently with particular norms in a relevant subculture. This is true when people in a certain group wear clothing of a certain kind, or when people who smoke cigarettes receive peer group approval simply by virtue of the fact that they are violating more broadly held norms. (Hence those who reject generally held norms may be the most committed of conformists; they are following the norms of a subcommunity, as when teenagers choose a form of dress that violates generally held norms but imposes a rigid orthodoxy on the subgroup.) 
There are many possible reasons for rejecting prevailing norms. Some people depart from the prevailing norm because of their reflective judgments. Such people think, on reflection, that the norm is too silly or too unworthy to affect behavior, or that relevant roles diminish autonomy or well-being. Marrying someone of a different race may reflect thisjudg51. See Edna Ullmann-Margalit, The Emergence of Norms 18-133 (1977). For an important discussion of how norms produce social order, and solve collective action problems, in the absence of legal constraints, see Robert C. Ellickson, Order Without Law (1991). But norm changes need not produce Pareto improvements; there can be losers as well as winners even in the face of a solution to a collective action problem, as when, for example, some members of a small group reject a ban on littering. Moreover, there is a crucial question about which norms are taken as given, and which are put up for grabs, in the sort ofanalysis that celebrates certain norms as solving collective action problems. See infra Part VI.A. For an illuminating discussion of why norms might be inefficient, see Eric A. Posner, Law, Economics, and Inefficient Norms, 144 U. Pa. L. Rev. (forthcoming 1996). 
A growing literature discusses the place of norms in ordering behavior entirely outside of law. See, e.g., Lisa Bernstein, Opting Out of the Legal System: Extralegal Contractual Relations in the Diamond Industry, 21 J. Legal Stud. 115 (1992); Robert D. Cooter, Structural Adjudication and the New Law Merchant: A Model of Decentralized Law, 14 Int'l Rev. L. & Econ. 215 (1994). This literature raises interesting questions about the extralegal development of norms and the extent to which law should build on those norms. ment; sharing domestic labor on an equal basis almost certainly does. 52 In other cases, as discussed above, the departure simply expresses defiance, and the real desire is to flout convention, whatever the norm is.5 3 Many apparently odd practices involving dress and manners are rooted in this phenomenon; some people find defiance an intrinsic good, and what they are defying is more or less incidental.m In still other cases, the departure is the expression of an individual desire or taste, which the person would pursue whether or not it is inconsistent with social roles and accompanying norms. Consider the view that Coca-Cola actually is better than all other drinks, a view that might be reflected in unconventional drink selections in many imaginable places. 
The fact that some people like to reject social norms is highly relevant to law. For example, a serious problem with legal efforts to inculcate social norms is that the source of the effort may be disqualifying. Such efforts may be futile or even counterproductive. If Nancy Reagan tells teenagers to "justsay no" to drugs, many teenagers may think that it is very good to say "yes."5 5 It is said that propaganda efforts in the former Soviet Union failed simply because the source of the propaganda was not trusted; hence the government's effort to inculcate norms of its choosing fell on deaf ears. 56 These points bear on the regulation of social risks-a principal concern of this article-particularly in the areas of teenage smoking and potentially dangerous sexual activity. Efforts by private or public authorities to stigmatize certain acts may have the opposite effect. 
The fact that norms are contested within a heterogeneous society can lead to the creation of many diverse norm communities. People who are dissatisfied with prevailing norms can vote with their feet, using the power of "exit" to leave norm communities they dislike and to enter into groups built on more congenial norms. They may even create, or seek to enter, self-consciously deviant subcommunities. Many American high schools reflect this phenomenon, as students find groups that are defined in a relatively crisp way, and as groups intermingle only on occasion. The most conspicuous norm communities are private; but in a system with state and local governments and free mobility, there are public norm communities too, as people sort themselves by choosing localities with congenial norms. The norms of such communities may be reflected in supportive state or local laws in which, for example, homosexual relations are permitted, or traditional morality is enforced. And once sorting has begun, processes of "voice" can increase the intensity and uniformity of governing norms. Homogenous local communities may insist on their own norms. National rights are often a safeguard against the possibly injurious character of this process. 
To the extent that people can freely enter and exit norm communities, such communities offer important protection against oppressive norms. On the other hand, it can be very costly to exit from the norm community in which one finds oneself, and the fact that one has been raised in that community may make other options seem unthinkable,57 even though they might be much better.58 
within relevant communities, money itself is not fungible.5 9 The point deserves separate discussion, for it has particular importance for law and legal policy, and it has not received the attention it deserves. 
Consider, for example, the fact that money is often compartmentalized. 60 Some money is specially reserved for the support of children. Some money is for gifts. Some is for one's own special fun. Some money is for summer vacation. Some money is for a rainy day. Thus a study of practices in Orange County, California, says that residents keep a variety of domestic "cash stashes"-"generally one in the billfold of each adult, children's allowances and piggy banks, a 'petty cash' fund in a teapot-equivalent, a dish of change for parking meters or laundry"-or "banked stashes of money," including Christmas club savings and accounts designated for spe57. See Kuran, supra note 17, at 176-95 (describing "the unthinkable and the unthought"). 
to and even defined by reference to more generally held norms; it might be better if the community as a whole could do something about those norms. These points bear on the legitimate role of government

manuscript, on file with the Columbia Law Review). cial expenditures such as property or other taxes, vacations, or home and car insurance payments. 6 ' Social theorists have often feared that the use of money would "flatten" social life, by erasing qualitative distinctions among goods. Ironically, however, social life, pervaded as it is by social norms, has "unflattened" money by insisting on qualitative distinctions. 62 "There is no single, uniform, generalized money, but multiple monies: people earmark different currencies for many or perhaps all types of social interactions .... And people will in fact respond with anger, shock, or ridicule to the 'misuse' of monies for the wrong circumstances or social relations .... ,,63 
The existence of norms involvng money suggests that it may not be possible to infer global judgments from particular consumption choices that are dependent on context-specific norms. Of course a wide range of norms ban the use of dollars as a reason for action, and sometimes law fortifies such norms; consider prohibitions on prostitution, vote-trading, and surrogate parenthood. 64 Here, however, I am concerned with norms that "subsidize" or "tax" certain uses of money. The point is important because economists often claim that particular choices demonstrate or reveal general valuations. 65 But this may be a mistake, because particular choices are a function of social norms that may be limited to the particular context. In a different context, the governing norms may be quite different. Thus, for example, the refusal to insure certain goods may be a product of social norms that are limited to the particular context of insurance. If so, it may be wrong to draw from insurance choices general conclusions about (say) the appropriate domain of tort law.66 
often self-consciously concerned with social roles. Because the subject of roles raises distinctive issues, I now discuss some of the relationships among roles, norms, and law. 
Consider the following social roles: doctor, employee, waiter, law school dean, wife, friend, pet-owner, colleague, student. Each of these roles is accompanied by a remarkably complex network of appropriate norms. The network is not easily reduced to rules, but people know, it sees norms as taxes on or subsidies to choice, and hence as part of the array of considerations that people face in making decisions. 16 5 
Sometimes it seems desirable for individuals or societies to change choices. Government might attempt to change, or help people to change, choices by changing social norms, social meanings, and social roles. In fact changes in norms may be the cheapest and most effective way to make things better, whatever are our criteria for assessing that matter. The relation between behavior and norms has yet to receive sustained attention; when we attend to that relation, we see that government has a policy instrument of great potential value. In this section I deal with some general points. I turn to more specific grounds, and more specific objections, in Parts VI and VII. 
To be sure, private power to create norm communities may make government action less necessary or less desirable. Often the best step is to allow those communities to be formed and to see how they work out. But sometimes it is too costly for individuals to create or join those communities, and sometimes the generally held norm is too damaging to human well-being. These issues cannot be solved in the abstract; the judgment depends on the details. But it is clear that norms can create problems of various sorts and that collective action may be required in some cases. 
Common objections to "paternalism" or "meddling" are not easy to sustain in such contexts. Recall that people usually do not choose norms, meanings, and roles; all of these are (within limits) imposed. As I have said, it would be ludicrous to deplore norms, meanings, and roles. They make life possible and they much facilitate social engagement. They provide the context within which free interaction is possible. Nonetheless, some of them operate as severe limits on autonomy or well-being, and certainly they should not be treated as fixed or given regardless of their content or consequences. 
Private groups can test or even change norms. Indeed, the testing of current norms, meanings, and roles is a crucial function of groups that are intermediate between citizens and the state. Religious groups are in this sense norm entrepreneurs; the same is true for environmental and civil rights organizations. But sometimes private groups are unable to produce desirable change on their own. This is a point missed by the idea that the sole basis for government action is to avoid force, fraud, and "harm to others."166 Obstacles to autonomy and to good lives can also come from bad roles, norms, and meanings. 
Changes in norms and meanings can promote human well-being. Often all or most people would, on reflection, like to see a change in a particular norm; 167 and yet they cannot bring about the change on their own, because in his individual capacity, each person has limited power to alter meanings, norms, or roles. The case of mandatory helmets for hockey players is a familiar example. Hockey players may prefer not to wear helmets if the meaning of helmet-wearing is cowardice; but their preferred solution, available only through a league mandate, is a system in which all are required to wear helmets, and hence players wear helmets without signalling cowardice.' 68 Of course shifts in norms, meanings, and roles are pervasive. Consider, for example, changing norms with respect to smoking, littering, drug use, polluting, racial discrimination, sexual relations outside of marriage, the roles of women and men, and interracial relationships. 
In fact it is often hard to know what people would "like" or prefer, because their judgments and desires are entangled with norms, meanings, and roles, and because once one or more of these is changed, they may be better off, either objectively or subjectively. If government changes the social meaning of smoking (see the third tale169), has it acted illegitimately? What if most people, or most smokers, would, on reflection, want smoking to have a different meaning? Or suppose that government tries to change an aspect of a certain social role, like that of unwed fathers, high school teachers, homosexuals, or workers. Surely the consequences of the change matter; surely it matters if the change is supported by (most or all) unwed fathers, high school teachers, homosexuals, or workers, and if members of each group face a collective action problem. The justification for government action is firm if all or almost all people support it as a means of solving a collective action problem. 
Suppose that government wants to change norms, meanings, or roles. It has many different tools for doing so; some of these are mildly intrusive while others may foreclose choice. Government may restrict itself to education,understood as simple statements of fact designed to en166. See Epstein, supra note 16, at 37-49; Richard A. Posner, Sex and Reason 2-4 (1992). I think that both Epstein and Posner give inadequate attention to the libertylimiting effects of norms, roles, and meanings. The classic source of the "harm to others" idea, Mill, offers subtle arguments on the point. See John S. Mill, The Subjection of Women (1869); John S. Mill, On Liberty (1859) (developing a complex discussion of pressures to conform). 
constant. See infra Part VIA2. 
sure accurate beliefs. We have seen that norms, meanings, and roles can be a function of beliefs and that beliefs are mutable. 170 Perhaps prevailing beliefs are false and warrant correction. People may think that AIDS is a disease limited to homosexuals, that smoking does not hurt nonsmokers, or that there is no relation between cholesterol and heart disease or between diet and cancer. Changing norms with respect to smoking are almost certainly a result-at least in part-of information from the government about health risks. t7 1 
Of course government may try to ensure accurate beliefs in order to persuade people to do something new or different. It may seek to increase or decrease shame; or it may not be thinking much about norms. But so long as government restricts itself to the provision of accurate information, there should be no objection to governmental efforts to correct false beliefs, even if the correction affects norms, meanings, and roles. In fact the change along this dimension may be the most important consequence of education, which may, for example, remove certain kinds of shame on the part of people who want to buckle their seat belts or abstain from premarital sex. 
Government may also attempt to engage in persuasion,understood as a self-conscious effort to alter attitudes and choices rather than simply to offer information. 172 Consider the third tale; 173 assume that some such advertisement had been issued by state officials. Perhaps it would have been effective (though its social meaning would have been altogether different if issued by officials rather than by members of the private AfricanAmerican community). The "justsay no" policy for drugs falls in the category of attempted persuasion; so, too, with efforts to control AIDS by strongly encouraging the use of condoms or abstinence from sex. Here government does not restrict itself to provision of information, but instead uses rhetoric and vivid images to change norms, meanings, or roles, and in this way attempts to persuade people to choose a certain course. 174 
If government is interested in persuasion, it will understand that "reference states" matter a great deal, and it will use this understanding to lead people in the right direction. People are generally loss averse, in the sense that they are made more unhappy by a loss of a certain amount than they are made happy by an equivalent gain. 175 Hence reactions to information turn a good deal on how the information is framed. A claim that breast cancer examinations will increase the number of lives saved (over what it would otherwise be) is far less effective than a claim that the failure to examine one's breast will decrease the number of lives saved (over what it would otherwise be). 176 Similarly, energy conservation programs are far more effective if they point to the dollars lost through failure to conserve than if they point to the dollars saved through conservation. 177 The difference has a great deal to do with social norms and social meanings and in particular with shame. If government is interested in changing behavior, it will take advantage of the phenomenon of loss aversion. 
Some people think that although the provision of information can be justified, government should rarely or never attempt to persuade. 178 But if norms, roles, and meanings are beyond individual control, and sometimes bad, this thought is hard to sustain, at least if government is subject to democratic controls. 
Consider in this connection the problem of smoking and the lessons of the third tale.179 Among African-Americans between 18 and 24, the smoking rate has fallen from 37.1% in 1965, to 31.8% in 1979, to 20.4% in 1987, to 10.3% in 1992.180 Among whites in the same age group, the rate fell from 38.4% in 1965 to 27.8% in 1987-but it has remained more or less constant since that time.' 8 ' The change among African-American teenagers is universally described as a" 'public health success story,' "but one that government officials cannot explain.' 8 2 Though no one has a full account of this phenomenon, changing social norms appear to be instead of changing to a preferred alternative); see also Dubourg et al., supra note 141, at 128 (discussing overwhelming importance of the "reference state" in determining reactions to changes in risks).

If government could bring about a general change in social norms-through, for example, attempts at persuasion-it is hardly clear that there would be a good objection to its behavior. Consider related findings about the close relation between norms and alcohol abuse.'8 
Government also might use economic instruments to tax or subsidize choices. Of course education is assisted publicly, as are day care, museums, and public broadcasting (at least as of this writing). Alcoholic drinks, tobacco products, generation of waste, and some polluting activities are met with taxes (although some of these are subsidized too). We can understand some economic incentives as efforts in part to counteract social meanings, social norms, or social roles with financial benefits or penalties designed to produce a good "equilibrium." A social meaning that is perceived to be bad might be "matched" with a financial disincentive. Some such incentives may amount to efforts to change social norms or social meanings. If a good becomes more expensive, the social meaning of choosing it may change. Cigarette smoking, for example, may become less popular if most people cannot afford to smoke. Of course it is hard to predict the effects of changes in price on norms. 
Government also might impose time, place, and manner restrictions. It might ban smoking in public places. It might say that television shows containing violence may be shown only in certain time slots. It might require government itself to choose low-polluting motor vehicles. It might ban affirmative action in the public sector but allow it in the private sector. Strategies of this kind might affect the social meaning of the to some other harmful substance, such as illicit drugs. But it is notable that AfricanAmericans have lower lifetime rates of reported use of illicit drugs (especially cocaine) than whites. The 1990 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse finds that 40 to 50 percent fewer African-Americans than whites under age 35 report any lifetime use of cocaine. (About 20% more African-Americans than whites over age 35 report lifetime cocaine experience.) For use in the last year, African-Americans between 12 and 17 report the lowest rates of use of cocane-1.7% compared to 2.3% for whites. African-Americans in the 12 to 17 age group consistently posted lower prevalence rates than whites for lifetime, past year, and past month use. (Surveys in 1985, 1988 and 1990.) All of these data suggest that young African-Americans use illicit drugs at a lower rate than do young white people. These data do not address directly the substitution of cocaine for cigarettes. But it appears that while African-Americans between 12 and 17 use cocaine at lower rates than whites (according to 1985, 1988, and 1990 surveys), rates for both groups have decreased from 1985 to 1990. The white rate has decreased from 4.2% to 2.3% and the African-American rate has gone from 2.4% to 1.7%. Thus it seems that the public health success story regarding African-American teenagers and cigarette smoking also extends to cocaine use. And there may be another public health success story to be told with respect to cocaine use among white teenagers. All data is from Denise B. Kandel, The Social Demography of Drug Use, 69 Milbank Q. 365, 395-99 (1991). I am grateful to Tracy Meares for help on this point. 

Working Sober Occupational Drinking Culture (forthcoming 1996). relevant activity very generally. But they do not foreclose choice entirely; they channel it instead. Of course in cases of this sort, government is directly affecting behavior. What I am suggesting is that it may be seeking as well to affect social norms and social meanings by affecting the wellsprings of shame and pride. The social meaning of smoking is, for example, affected by virtue of the existence of time, place, and manner restrictions, even in places lacking those restrictions. 
The most intrusive kind of government action is of course straightforward coercion. Thus government might prohibit the use of certain drugs; require everyone to recycle or buckle their seat belts; or make education mandatory for people under a certain age. 
A polity concerned to change norms could proceed through different levels and with different institutional arrangements. Should it encourage private behavior through creative public-private partnerships? Should it, for example, fund private groups that are engaged in discouraging teenage pregnancy, drug use, and promiscuity? There is also a question about whether national action or local action is better. Norm management could occur in towns; it could happen at the state level; it could be a self-conscious effort of the national government. 
The question about appropriate levels of government is hard to answer in the abstract. Much depends on the details. But two notations may be appropriate. First, public-private partnerships are often the most fruitful of all possible approaches. Purely governmental efforts at norm management may fail for lack of trust; imagine, for example, if the national government had engaged in the anti-smoking campaign that was apparently so successful among African-American teenagers. Often a government concerned with bad norms does best by working with charitable and religious organizations which can have a high level of competence, experience, and trust. 
Second, it is probably best to have a presumption in favor of the lowest possible level of government.'8 5 The lowest level is closest to the people, and in that sense most responsive to it, and most likely to be trusted by it. The risk of futility or positive harm is accordingly diminished. Of course there are familiar counterarguments, and sometimes national efforts at norm management are welljustified. But a nation that is concerned about existing norms should exploit the possibilities that exist in a system committed to federalism.

In this section I discuss several grounds for governmental efforts to change norms, meanings, and roles. The unifying theme is the expressive function oflaw-a term that I use to identify the function of law in expressing social values and in encouraging social norms to move in particular directions.18 6 
My discussion will not by any means exhaust law's expressive uses,' 8 7 and I do not discuss any of these grounds in much detail. I offer instead a brief sketch of some possibilities. An account of legitimate grounds for changes in norms will overlap a great deal with-and may even be reducible to-an account of the legitimate bases for governmental action. My purpose here is hardly to offer such an account, but instead to see how some fairly standard ideas might be brought to bear on the particular subjects under discussion. In none of these cases do I urge that social norms should be free from scrutiny on the merits by individual citizens. Government ought not to inculcate norms that cannot be supported and evaluated publicly, and on the basis of reasons. Like rules, norms will typically have a degree of crudeness and rigidity, and it is entirely appropriate for citizens to conclude that there are contexts in which even good norms make no sense if they are mandated.' 8 8 
Nor do I urge that the mere fact that behavior is a function of norms provides some warrant for governmental action. To defend governmental action, some claim has to be offered about how such action will make things better. A reference to norms helps undermine the view that government should restrict itself to the satisfaction of "preferences." We have seen that this term is highly ambiguous and that norms can often undermine human well-being. But to defend a change, the idea of wellbeing has to be specified, and it has to be shown that the change would improve matters under the relevant criteria. 
To introduce the analysis, we might make a few initial distinctions. change a norm, a meaning, or a role. In the case of hockey helmets, for

to stigmatize unwed parenthood. At first glance, it seems legitimate for public and private institutions to try to inculcate norms that make people feel ashamed if they produce children who will have horrible life prospects. For this reason, efforts to inculcate norms against unwed parenthood-in cases in which the children who result will have miserable lives-are fully supportable. But there are several questions that might be raised about this conclusion: (a) In some cases, unwed parents will not have done anything wrong, and hence they are entitled not to feel ashamed; (b) The fact that the children will have miserable lives may be a result of a background of social injustice; (c) Shame is heavy medicine, and some people might think that government should feel free to inculcate norms but not the particular norm of shame in this setting. These are merely questions about the project of shame inculcation in this context; they do not purport to be answers. example, there may be near-unanimous agreement that things would be better if the meaning of helmet-wearing were not cowardice. In the case of cleaning up after one's dog, almost everyone may agree that things would be better if there was a norm in favor of cleaning up. Of course any such agreement may depend on norms that should themselves be brought into question. 189 We might say that the agreement can be "impeached" by showing that people do not, on reflection, endorse the norms that produce agreement, or that there are problems with those norms. 
function not of intrinsic value, and not of effects on people's (well-considered) judgments about their self-conception, but instead a function of the reputational consequences of choice; and they will agree too that it would be better if the reputational consequences were different. All or almost all people might agree, for example, that use of drugs in a certain community stems from the reputational benefits of using drugs and the reputational costs of refusing to do so. They also might agree that things would be better if using drugs produced reputational harm rather than benefit; they might act accordingly via law (with education, attempted persuasion, economic incentives, or coercion). In this kind of case, there is also a possibility of "impeachment" of the agreement along lines suggested above. 
system. They may turn a morally irrelevant characteristic-race and gender are the most obvious examples-into a signalling device with respect to social role and associated norms. If a caste system is unjust, it is appropriate to alter norms, roles, and meanings that perpetuate it. 
autonomy, by discouraging them from being exposed to diverse conceptions of the good and from giving critical scrutiny to their own conceptions, in such a way as to make it impossible for them to be, in any sense, masters of the narratives of their own lives.190 
These are brief notations on some highly controversial subjects. Needless to say, I cannot attempt here to defend an account of the appropriate role of the state; my purpose is more modestly to connect the project of norm management with some familiar ideas about what the state legitimately does. Notably, there are cases in which it is unnecessary to choose among two or more of the general grounds for government action; people with varying theoretical commitments might believe that a particular action makes sense. Hence political participants might achieve

But political liberals might well favor an effort to ensure against norms that prevent people from being or acquiring the capacities to be free and equal citizens. See id. at 174-76. an incompletely theorized agreemet on a particular outcome-an agreement on what steps make best sense, unaccompanied by a shared understanding of why, exactly, they make the best sense. 1 91 Those interested in possible changes in norms would do well to take advantage of such agreements. 
A. Some Unusual Collective Action Problems 
economists, lawyers, and political scientists,' 9 2 social practices would be inefficient were it not for certain social norms; such norms solve collective action problems. They do the work of law.193 They may provide conventions on which everyone voluntarily settles; table manners are examples. Or they may solve prisoner's dilemmas through social sanctions imposed on deviants; this is true of the idea that people should clean up after their dogs. And the absence of such norms makes some existing practices highly inefficient. 
Let us begin here with the simple and conventional case of littering, captured in the second tale.' 94 Under ordinary assumptions, each person may well litter-if the costs of throwing things in the garbage are wholly internalized, whereas the benefits of doing so are spread across a wide range of people. In the standard account, "rational" individuals, acting in their "self-interest," will produce a great deal of litter, perhaps so much that legal regulation ultimately is required. This idea helps explain legal responses to environmental degradation, as in the cases of mandatory recycling, taxes on or fees for polluting activity, and command and control regulation. 
questions might be raised by the standard account. The relevant changes do not bring about Pareto improvements, which occur only when everyone gains or at least some gain and no one loses. But in the cases at hand, some people are losers; in fact many people may be losers. With a mandatory seat belt law, for example, there will be people who dislike wearing seat belts and resent the coercion, no matter the number of people who wear them. Their objection has nothing to do with the social meaning of wearing belts; it involves the intrinsic inconvenience of doing SO. 
We should, in this light, distinguish the very simplest cases-in which all or nearly all people favor a change in norms-from cases in which 1733, 1735-36 (1995); Cass R. Sunstein, Legal Reasoning and Political Conflict ch. 2 (1996) [hereinafter Sunstein, Legal Reasoning]. 
18-133. 
26, at 125-40; Ullmann-Margalit, supra note 51, at 89-93. 
there are bare majorities in favor of such a change. If everyone would favor a situation in which people pick up after their dogs, but this result cannot be brought about without government action, the case is easy: Government action should be initiated. But if 65% of people would favor the change, and 35% like the status quo, we have a harder case. Perhaps the change would be favored under the Kaldor-Hicks criterion; but that criterion is highly controversial. 19 5 To decide whether government action is appropriate, it is thus necessary to take a stand on a large question in political theory; the fact that norm-change is involved means that the setting is unusual, but the basic analysis is not.196 
Even more fundamentally, the words "rational" and "self-interest" obscure a great deal, since they take so much for granted. At first glance it appears that there is no sharp dichotomy between rationality and social norms or between self-interest and social norms; taking the words in their ordinary sense, what is rational and what is in an agent's self-interest are functions of social norms. 19 7 Return to our second story1 9 8 and suppose that there is a social norm that everyone should pick up litter. 19 9 If the norm is in place, people who act in their rational self-interest will not litter. In the second tale, were the non-litterers or members of the control group acting in their rational self-interest? What is rational, and what promotes self-interest, depends on many exogenous factors, including existing norms. 200 
There is a further point,20 1 and it raises serious difficulties for the traditional account of the relationship between norms and collective ac. 195. See Richard A. Posner, The Economics of Justice 91-92 (1981); cf. Ronald Dworkin, Is Wealth a Value?, in A Matter of Principle 237 (1985) (criticizing using "social wealth" maximization as a basis for social action). 
government is pursuing legitimate ends and also whether the action is likely to be effective. See infra Part VII. 
inconsistent with the view that we should adopt a tractable definition of rationality for positive purposes and see how that definition helps in predicting behavior. What might be adapted to this kind of approach is an understanding that the incentives created by norms will play a role in an individual's judgment about what is the rational thing to do. 
Persuasion: Essays on the History, Theory, and Rhetoric of Ownership 1, 2-3 (1994) (discussing role of norms in providing environmental protection). 
Selfinterest might be self-consciously defined in narrowly economic terms, in which case it is not formal but, on the contrary, has a point-the defeat of sometimes corrosive social norms such as honor, which can in some circumstances cause people to fight. Hence Holmes argues that the early liberal enthusiasm for self-interest was designed not to disparage altruism but instead to call attention to the fact that if people are pursuing economic goals in a self-interested way, they may not do the sorts of mischief associated with fanatics and dogmatists of various stripes. See id. at 53-62. 
tion problems. 20 2 The difficulty is that any collective action problem can be characterized as such only because of a wide range of norms, and not only because of the particular norm that is said to be producing the problem. The traditional account focuses on one norm, but the problem is a product of a wide range of them. 
Suppose, for example, that there is no norm against littering; that people think that there is too much litter; and that they would like to create a new, anti-littering norm. Would it be right to say that this is a case involving a collective action problem that would be served best with the aid of a new social norm, that is, a norm against littering? The statement would not be false, but it would be misleading and incomplete. What gives rise to the collective action problem is an array of individual judgments and desires that are themselves (in all likelihood) a function of social norms. There are, for example, norms against clutter, norms involving certain conceptions of aesthetics, norms about public spaces. If people "want" a new norm-the norm against littering-their desire probably stems from many other norms, such as norms favoring clean rather than dirty parks, norms in favor of shared rather than maldistributed burdens, norms in favor of solutions through norms rather than coercion or fines. 
When a situation is supposed to create a prisoner's dilemma that would be satisfied by some norm Z, the situation presupposes a range of norms A through Y which are being held constant and not being put in contention. Then the question becomes: Why is it that norm Z (say, the norm with respect to littering) is put into question, rather than some other norm (say, the norm favoring clean parks)? Why should a norm be established in favor of cleaning up after one's dog, instead of changing the norm producing unwillingness to be exposed to the relevant mess? This question has yet to be addressed in existing work on collective action and social norms. And the question has a powerful Coasian dimension.203 The traditional account takes a set of norms as given, without tsieceuilnagr tnhoartmthethyatthehmassebleveens mpiugthitnbtoe aqluteesretido,nr.2a0th4er than altering the par 
Several answers might be offered. On the Coasian view, we might ask which norms can be changed most cheaply. Just as one person in a legal controversy might be the cheapest cost avoider, so one norm in a collective action problem might be the cheapest target of norm management. pollution as a problem of externalities, Pigou did not see that the pollution problem is a function notjust of the polluter's most recent act, but also of something that is being taken for granted, that is the numerous acts and omissions of both polluters and pollutees. See id. at 34. In seeing a certain norm Z as creating or solving collective action problems, the traditional view does not see that norms A through Y are also important sources of the problems. Perhaps norm A, B or C might be altered more cheaply than norm Z could be. It is plausible, for example, to think that it is much more efficient to create a norm in favor of cleaning up than to create a norm making people approve of clutter and mess. On this view, we would not inquire into the merits or basis of existing norms, but ask more simply which norms can be altered at the lowest cost. I speculate that an implicitjudgment of this kind lies behind the traditional approach to this problem. 
Alternatively, and departing from economic criteria, we might put at issue those norms that are not part of the relevant agents's own deepest convictions and self-understandings. Typically the norms thought to solve collective action problems seem to be a form of "tinkering," encouraging conduct that preserves what people believe most deeply, have thought through, or most take for granted. Finally, we might not look to agents's convictions but venture instead an objective account of human needs and human interests. On this view, we should create a norm against littering, rather than a norm in favor of clutter and mess, because lives are objectively better with the first norm than with the second. On such an approach, a collective action problem exists because if reasonable agents could agree on the norm in question, things would be better rather than worse. It is not clear, however, that this way of seeing things can coexist with ordinary understandings of collective action problems, which are rooted in subjective desires. A possible conclusion of what I have said thus far is that in the context of norms, the ordinary understandings face a serious conceptual problem. 
that make it rational for people, acting in their self-interest, to avoid collective action problems. When such problems exist, it is because of the social norms that make rational self-interest take a certain form-in favor, for example, of refusing to clean up or otherwise failing to contribute to shared projects. 2 05 If we draw back from the puzzles just discussed, we can make a simple point for simple cases: A large task for society and' for law is to try to inculcate the relevant norms. Effective responses promote efficiency 20 6 and simultaneously enhance a form of freedom by producing outcomes that citizens reflectively judge best but cannot obtain on their own. 
Much legal regulation has this goal. Such regulation might even consist of direct coercion, designed to generate good norms or to pick up the slack in their absence. There are laws designed to ensure that everyone picks up after their dog; that people do not litter; that people do not smoke in certain places. These laws are rarely if ever enforced through criminal prosecutions. But they have an effect in shaping social norms and social meanings. They do this in large part because there is a general eliminating the collective action problem. See Terry L. Anderson &Donald R. Leal, Free Market Environmentalism 3 (1991). 
mind. norm in favor of obeying the law. The relevant laws help to inculcate both shame and pride; they help define the appropriate sources of these things. (Of course people have to be brought up to have a sense of shame, and to have a certain understanding of what sorts of things call for shame, notably including certain paradigm cases from which analogies appear. 20 7 ) They readjust the personal calculation, making what is rational, and what is in one's self-interest, different from what they were before. 
The key point is that such a change may be supported by the reflective judgments of all or most people. When it is, there should be no objection in principle.208 The point very much bears on the phenomenon of norm bandwagons. People may actually reject existing norms but fail to state their opposition publicly, and once public opposition becomes less costly, new norms may rapidly come into place. 
John Jones, the protagonist of the fifth tale,20 9 is in one way quite usual: There is an evident and pervasive difference between people's choices as consumers and their choices as citizens. This is because people are choosing quite different things.2 1 0 In their private capacity, people may watch silly situation comedies; but they may also support, as citizens, the use of government resources to assist public broadcasting. Some people seek stringent laws protecting the environment or endangered species even though they do not use the public parks or derive material benefits from protection of endangered species-and even though in their private behavior, they are unwilling to do much to protect environmental amenities. The mere existence of certain environmental goods seems to be highly valued by political participants, even if they are not willing to back up the valuation with dollars in private markets. Of course many people give to organizations that support environmental protection. But what people favor as political participants can be different from what they favor as consumers. It is in part for this reason that democratic outcomes are distinct from those that emerge from markets.2 1 ' 
In fact a good deal of empirical work shows that people's judgments about politics are not a product of their self-interest, narrowly under207. See Churchland, supra note 128, at 272-78 (describing role of paradigm cases in mental functioning); Charles E. Larmore, Patterns of Moral Complexity 1-5 (1987) (discussing moral examples). Creativity in politics and law usually consists of assimilating new cases to the paradigm ones. See Sunstein, Legal Reasoning, supra note 191, at ch. 3.

citizens may support laws for whose costs other people are responsible. stood. People without health care are not more likely to support laws creating a right to health care; people recently victimized by crime are not more likely to support aggressive policies against crime. Norms and values are instead the principal determinant of political judgment.2 12 
The disjunction between political and consumption choices presents a puzzle. Would it make sense to say that consumer behavior is a better or more realistic reflection of "actual" preferences than is political behavior?2 18 In light of the fact that choices depend on context, and do not exist in the abstract, the very notion of a "better reflection" of "actual" preferences is a confusing one; there is no such thing as an "actual" (in the sense of unitary or acontextual) preference in these settings. The difference might be explained by the fact that political behavior reflects judgments made for a collectivity.2 14 For this reason it reflects a variety of social norms that are distinctive to the context of politics. 
Because of the governing norms, citizens may seek to implement individual and collective aspirations in political behavior but not in private consumption. 215 As citizens, people may seek the aid of the law to bring about a social state that they consider to be higher than what emerges from market ordering. People may, in their capacity as political actors, attempt to promote altruistic or other-regarding goals, which diverge from the self-interested preferences sometimes characteristic of markets. Political decisions might also vindicate metapreferences or second-order preferences. People have wishes about their wishes, and sometimes they try to vindicate those second-order wishes, including considered judgments about what is best, through law. And norms with respect to public discussion may impose "taxes" on public statements of various sorts-perhaps requiring them to be "laundered,"21 6 perhaps inducing conformity by punishing certain dissident views that might be reflected in other spheres. 
In all of these ways, the norms at work in democratic arenas can produce different choices from those produced by markets. It would be wrong to say that the market choices are more "real" or "true." The question of which choices should govern for purposes of law and policy depends on a range of contextual issues that cannot be resolved by refer212. See Dennis Chong, Values, Norms, and Interests in the Explanation of Social Conflict, 144 U. Pa. L. Rev. (forthcoming 1996); David 0. Sears & Carolyn L. Funk, SelfInterest in Americans' Political Opinions, in Beyond Self-Interest 147, 150-64, 168-70 (JaneJ. Mansbridge ed., 1990).

See id. at 75-76. ence to notions of "choice" and "preference" alone. Of course some collective judgments might be wrong, productive of inefficiency, invasive of rights, or confused. I take up this point below. 
Thus far I have tried to avoid the most controversial questions and to build from common understandings. Let us venture now into more complicated territory, connected with the ideas of well-being and autonomy. 
Outside of the domain of autonomy, we might think that there are obstacles to well-being in norms that encourage people to take high risks simply because the failure to do so signals-in light of those normscowardice or worse. Suppose that people engage in certain behavior not because of its intrinsic value but because of the reputational cost of failing to do so. We are dealing, then, with classes of cases in which the danger accompanying choice means that intrinsic utility is not high but risk-taking behavior persists because of social norms. Suppose too that people dislike the norms that generate that reputational cost, or that on reflection, people would dislike those norms. If so, norms that encourage people to carry guns, use dangerous drugs, drive well over the speed limit, engage in unsafe sex, and so forth may properly be an object of governmental attack, because of their potentially pernicious effects on people's lives. Information and persuasion are probably the best tools for government to use. But in some cases economic incentives or coercion may be justified. 
Of course a liberal society might also want to ensure that all of its citizens are autonomous. 21 7 For the moment let us understand that notion in a way that leaves open many questions but that will be helpful for our limited purposes here. A citizen can be understood as autonomous insofar as she is able to choose among a set of reasonably good options and to be reflective and deliberative about her choice.218 A society can be understood as self-governing, and as politically autonomous, to the extent that its citizens face a range of reasonably good options and exercise capacities of reflection and deliberation about their choice. 
It should be clear that social norms, meanings, and roles may undermine individual autonomy. Above all this is because norms can compromise autonomy itself, by stigmatizing it. People may believe, on reflection, that the act of being well-educated should not be a source of shame; but in some communities, a good deal of education may be inconsistent with prevailing social norms.21 9 Or exposure to diverse options, and re217. A form of liberal perfectionism is defended in Raz, supra note 22, at 369-429. choice). 
Chen, A Matter of Survival: Women's Right to Employment in India and Bangladesh, in Women, Culture, and Development: A Study ofHuman Capabilities 37, 37-50 (Martha C. Nussbaum &Jonathan Glover eds., 1995). flection about which is best, may seem inconsistent with existing norms. In such cases autonomy cannot easily220 exist without collective assistance; people are able to produce the norms, meanings, and roles that they reflectively endorse only with governmental involvement. Something must be done collectively if the situation is to be changed. 
To promote autonomy, a society might seek to ensure that everyone has a minimal degree of education, a certain level of exposure to diverse conceptions of the good, and what might be considered the material bases of autonomy: food, shelter, and freedom from criminal violence. 22 1 In modest forms this project is fully compatible with political liberalism; perfectionist liberals might insist on a good deal in this vein in order to allow people to be (more or less) masters of the narratives of their own lives. 222 In either case, social norms can undermine the liberal project, and government might try to alter them in order to promote autonomy. People may have adopted prevailing norms rationally in view of limits in existing opportunities, as when norms discourage schooling for people whose prospects are poor;2 23 but such norms are nonetheless an obstacle to autonomy. 
A government that seeks to promote autonomy might well work against efforts by subcommunities to require conformity to a single defining creed. In fact conflicts between antidiscrimination principles and religious liberty have everything to do with perceived limits on governmental ability to change norms, meanings, and roles in subgroups that deny autonomy. These conflicts are generally resolved in favor of the latter, especially in the area of sex equality. But if we attend to the autonomy-denying effects of norms and meanings, it might well make sense to resolve the conflicts against subgroups, even religious ones. 
Social norms, social meanings, and social roles bear very much on problems of discrimination. For someone who is African-American, female, or handicapped, existing meanings are possible obstacles to autonomy or well-being. The social meaning of being female, for example, may bear on a range of choices at home and in the workforce. So, too, for the social meaning of particular choices by women, which may diverge sharply from similar choices from men: not to have children, to 
Commodities and Capabilities, supra note 130, at 81-83 (in India, the "perceptionof relative needs ofdifferent members of the family may be closely related to social influences"). Just as preferences can be adaptive to an unjust status quo, so can norms and meanings be a predictable outgrowth of limited autonomy or heteronomy. work as an airline pilot, to hate cooking, to dress in a certain way.224 We have seen that a status is a particular kind of role; statuses are imposed rather than chosen. Thus statuses are an occasional target of law. In particular, law might attempt to overcome a collective action problem faced by victims of discrimination in changing prevailing norms, meanings, and roles. 
In American law, problems of discrimination typically raise issues of caste. We might say that we have a system with caste-like features when a highly visible and morally irrelevant factor is turned, by social and legal practices, into a systematic source of societal disadvantage.2 25 An important and disastrous feature of this situation is the signallingeffect of the characteristic that is shared by lower caste members. That characteristic promotes a certain social role for caste members, since it is associated with a range of undesirable or otherwise stigmatizing traits. Often an attack on a caste system amounts to an attack on that social role and its associated social norms-especially as a result of behavioral norms shared, or thought to be shared, by members of the lower caste.2 26 For lower caste members, the problem is that the shared characteristic carries with it a meaning-stupidity, passivity, venality-that cannot be controlled by individual agents. 
Laws forbidding discrimination might well have, as one of their purposes and effects, a change in the signalling effect of the relevant characteristic. They might be designed to encourage people to be self-conscious about registering the preexisting signal. 
Suppose, for example, that it was thought important to alter social norms about gender relations. The social role of "being a woman" is associated with a wide range of social norms and social meanings. There are many examples from the present and recent past. Thus it may be that women do the majority of domestic labor. In these circumstances, a man who does most of the domestic labor might seem odd, or in some way woman-ish, and a woman who asks for something like equality in domestic labor might seem odd, selfish, or in some way man-ish. 227 Or a woman in her fifties might be seen as fundamentally different from a man in his fifties, because of social norms associated with gender. Or a single woman might be stigmatized, or inquired about, in ways fundamentally different from what happens to a similarly situated man. Or a woman who of biological characteristics, see Case, supra note 71, at 9-36.

of use of domestic money by women). complains about apparently mild forms of sexual harassment might seem to be a radical, "atroublemaker, or someone without a sense of humor. 
For lower caste members, a wide range of "choices" might emerge from the underlying social norms. These choices might reflect adaptation by lower caste members to existing injustice; they might be a product of the social opprobrium attached to violation of social norms by lower caste members.228 The choices might even be called "preferences";229 certainly desires can be affected. But many women believe on reflection that the social meaning of being a woman is bad for them and that it should be changed. These women face a collective action problem that may be solved best via law.23 0 In any case a caste system tends to deny autonomy to lower caste members. Thus we have a particular reason for legal intervention: to overcome the obstacles to autonomy produced by a system of caste, obstacles that cannot be overcome by individual agents. 
This is simply a stylized discussion of the problems faced by people who live within a caste system, and-who might seek to enlist the law to make things better. 
Many laws have an expressive function. They "make a statement" about how much, and how, a good or bad should be valued. They are an effort to constitute and to affect social meanings, social norms, and social roles. Most simply, they are designed to change existing norms and to influence behavior in that fashion. 
Of course human goods are valued in different ways; people have a wide variety of evaluative stances toward relationships and goods.2 3 1 Laws with expressive functions are often designed to promote a certain way of valuing certain goods. Many such laws are intended to say that specified goods should be valued in a way that deters thinking of them as mere objectsfor use. Laws forbidding the purchase and sale of certain goods can be so understood. A ban on the sale of children is designed (among other things) to say that children should be valued in a way that forbids the acceptance of cash as a reason for taking them out of parental care. A ban on vote-selling can be viewed similarly. We might understand such a law as an effort to make a certain statement about the pricelessness-not caste members in India).

who abandons the caste system, the potential member of an anticaste colony is likely to withhold his participation until it appears likely to succeed. With other potential members reasoning likewise, the colony will remain unformed."). 
the infinite value-of the right to vote. In the environmental area, debates over market valuation are partly debates over this question. 23 2 Some people think that market valuation should be viewed with suspicion; it threatens to affect social norms and social meanings in undesirable ways. 
Laws with expressive justifications are most plausibly defended on the ground that they will in fact affect social norms and move them in appropriate directions. 23 3 But at this stage there are empirical questions: Do laws really affect social norms and social meanings? Under what conditions? Much work remains to be done on these important questions. 
What I have suggested here should unsettle some common understandings about government "paternalism" and "meddling." If private choices are a function of roles, norms, and meanings over which private people have no sovereignty, many imaginable initiatives are consistent with individual autonomy, rightly conceived. But this conclusion ought not to suggest that government should be licensed to do whatever it wishes. There should be firm limits on government's efforts to engage in norm management. 
Of course government action should often be rejected on simple pragmatic grounds-because, for example, it is likely to be futile or counterproductive. 23 4 The "just say no" campaign with respect to drug use probably falls in this category. Perhaps efforts to stigmatize teenage smoking will backfire and make smoking seem bold or glamorous. Perhaps government has mistakenly concluded that there is a collective acton problem calling for governmental response. Perhaps most people are happy that littering is not stigmatized. 
It is also true that government interference with norms, roles, or meanings might compound a collective action problem, aid well-organized private groups promoting unjust goals, or aggravate a caste-like situation. Imagine an effort to promote the use of cigarettes, alcohol, or drugs, or to discouragethe buckling of seat belts, or to increase the opprobrium associated with the role of being a homosexual. Nothing I have said sug232. See Steven Kelman, What Price Incentives? 52-83 (1981). 
In making these claims, I do not endorse the use of law to "make statements" independently of consequences. Though I cannot defend the point here, official use of law merely to "make statements" risks fanaticism and pointlessness. See Sunstein, supra note 64. Indeed, emphasis on consequences-and on the empirical questions raised by arguments over consequences-has the salutary function of reducing the volume and the heat raised by policy disputes. It does so by shifting debate from basic values to issues that are, at least in principle, subject to empirical testing. I believe that this is an important social function of approaches to law and policy that are based on consequences; it is also part of the appeal of utilitarianism. 
perfectionist policies). gests that government is not properly criticized when it engages in activities of this sort. But any such criticism should be on the merits, not on the ground that government may not interfere with private preferences or choices. 
There is a final and especially important point. A liberal society limits the permissible bases for governmental action. 23 5 Ordinarily people describe these limits as "rights." Rights operate as constraints on norm management as on everything else that government does. A full account of these limits would be far too ambitious for an article of this sort; but a few notes will be helpful. 
Some government action designed to change norms, meanings, and roles might be based on religious grounds; these should be banned as reasons for public action. At least in the American constitutional system, for example, it is unacceptable for government to attempt to legislate on the ground that the divinity of Jesus Christ requires a certain state of affairs. 
It would be equally unacceptable to base government action on grounds that deny the basic equality of human beings-as in efforts to encourage norms that treat members of racial minorities as second-class citizens. Many efforts to change norms would impair autonomy rather than promote it. If government attempted to promote norms ensuring that women occupy traditional roles, its attempt would be illegitimatenot because it is an attempt at norm management, but because the attempted management invades rights of sex equality. 
In any case some human interests are properly denominated rights, and efforts to change norms, meanings, and roles should not be allowed to invade rights.23 6 Many imaginable efforts ought to be rejected because of this risk. Consider, for example, a suggestion that the meaning of refusing to allow government officials into your home is now "personal courage and independence"-accompanied by the not implausible thought that things would be better if the meaning were "unpatriotic unwillingness to cooperate with the crime-fighting effort," culminating in a proposal that all people should be required to open their homes to the government. There is a collective action problem here. But if it is believed that people should have a right to keep government officials from their homes, this proposal should be rejected. 
Political liberals go further and urge rejection of any ground for action that is based on a "comprehensive view."23 7 Of course there are 207, at 42-68; Raz, supra note 22, at 400-29. 
remain neutral by not selecting among divergent "conceptions of the good life"); Rawls, supra note 190, at 58-66, 133-72 (describing political principles on which those with diverse "comprehensive views" can rely). many complexities in this claim.238 What is important for present purposes is that on any sound view of liberalism, there is no generalbasis, in principle, for objection to proposals of the sort I have suggested. Political liberals ought to acknowledge, for example, that social roles and social meanings may undermine the equality and liberty of citizens and that changes require collective action. The constraints imposed by political liberalism impose no bans on those changes. 
CONCLUSION 
Many claims about the appropriate limits of law are insufficiently appreciative of the pervasive effects of social norms, social meanings, and social roles. In fact these effects have yet to receive much attention.239 But-to say the least-the impact of law on human behavior is an important matter for lawmakers to understand, and that impact has everything to do with social norms. An understanding of norms will therefore help illuminate effective regulatory policy. Many of the most dramatic gains in health and safety policy are a product of changes in norms, meanings, and roles. Many of the most severe problems in current societies are a product of unfortunate norms, meanings, and roles. 
Norms relate to some broader issues as well. Often it is said that the common law, and a liberal regime dedicated to freedom, take "preferences" as they are and do not seek to change them. But the term "preferences" is highly ambiguous. If the term is meant to refer to "choices," it should be understood that choices are very much a function of context, including governing norms, meanings, and roles. Certainly the particular choices made by people in markets-in their capacity as consumers or laborers-do not suggest global or acontextual valuations of relevant goods. If the term "preferences" is meant to refer not to choices but to the motivational and mental states behind choices, it is important to recognize that those mental states include assessments of social norms, the expressive meaning of acts, and the expectations associated with a dazzling variety of social roles. Norms and roles affect both public action and public talk, in ways that can much disguise how people think privately. This point has large implications. In many settings, it would be best to dispense with the idea of "preferences," and to shift instead to more concrete ideas, including intrinsic value, reputational effects, and effects on self-conception. 

Mean?, 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. (forthcoming 1996) (discussing how norms affect the public assessment of criminal punishment); Lessig, supra note 24 (arguing that law should account for, and regulate, social meaning); and from a different direction, Ellickson, supra note 51 (discussing norm of neighborliness in land-use bargaining); see also Kuran, supra note 17 (describing role of "preference falsification" in reflecting and shaping social norms). 
We have also seen that norms can be far more fragile than they appear. Hence "norm entrepreneurs" can help solve collective action problems, and hence "norm bandwagons" and cascades are common. Sometimes law interacts with the efforts of norm entrepreneurs, facilitating or blunting their efforts, and sometimes law ratifies or acceleratesor halts-norm bandwagons and cascades. 
While social life would be impossible without norms, meanings, and roles, individual people have little control over these things. The result can be severe limits on human well-being and autonomy. Certainly there is a problem with existing norms when all or almost all people would seek a change. There may well be a problem when reputational incentives lead people to do what they would otherwise refuse to do, at least if the relevant norms deny people the preconditions for autonomy or otherwise undermine well-being. In fact lives are shortened and unjustified inequalities are perpetuated by the existence of many current norms. 
People need collective help if they want to change norms, meanings, or roles. Collective help may be futile or counterproductive; it may be illegitimately motivated. But these matters require an inquiry into the particular context. The issue should not be foreclosed by resort to confusing claims about the need to respect private choice.

Gradually and in fits and starts, the American regulatory state is becoming a cost-benefit state. By this I mean that government regulation is increasingly assessed by asking whether the benefits of regulation justify the costs of regulation. 
My goal in this essay is to argue, on both economic and democratic grounds, on behalf of this transformation. I attempt to bring those arguments to bear on concrete debates over the appropriate nature of the emerging cost-benefit state. I will also urge a point that is not easily contested: regulatory legislation has diverse legitimate purposes, not limited to economic efficiency alone. This point does not argue against cost-benefit analysis, but it has important implications for the uses and limits of that technique. I will also argue against efforts to drown the administrative state in paperwork through excessive procedural requirements. 
For many years, those attempting to assess the performance of the regulatory state have been interested in statistical measures. Gross Domestic Product helps capture economic performance; can something similar be used for regulatory initiatives? The use of cost-benefit analysis can be understood partly as an effort to overcome the interest-based and anecdote-driven nature of contemporary regulation in favor of an approach that examines, in a readily understandable way, the real-world consequences of regulatory initiatives. 
Within the national government, the cost-benefit principle received its most prominent initial recognition via Executive Order 12291,1 issued by President Reagan in 1981. At least at the * Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of Chicago, Law School and Department of Political Science. 
1 3 CFR 128 (1981). symbolic level, the movement in the direction of cost-benefit analysis was much accelerated in 1985 with the issuance of Executive Order 12498,2 requiring that cost-benefit analysis inform the annual regulatory plan to be issued by all executive agencies. These initiatives were quite controversial insofar as they threatened to delay regulatory requirements and perhaps to transfer authority from individual agencies to OMB. But Presidents Reagan and Bush, among many others, believed that they provided a crucial mechanism by which the White House might coordinate and centralize regulation, โand ensure against measures that would do more harm than good. 
Many people doubted whether President Clinton would endorse the idea that regulatory judgments should be made with close reference to cost-benefit balancing. But despite pressure from some environmental organizations, President Clintonโs Executive Order 12866,3 issued in 1993, firmly embraces costbenefit analysis as a central ingredient in regulatory choice. The new Order does make some departures from the Reagan-Bush initiatives; but with respect to cost-benefit analysis, the change consists principally in references to โequityโ and โdistributional impactsโ as relevant factors. These are modest changes. Thus the Executive Branch has endorsed cost-benefit balancing for over fifteen years, and it seems reasonable to suppose that insofar as the White House is overseeing the federal regulatory process, cost-benefit analysis will continue to play a central organizing role. 
The executive branch has not acted alone. In reviewing regulatory decisions, courts have also enforced a form of costbenefit balancing, at least where Congress has authorized them to do so.4 Judges have invalidated regulatory action that imposes high costs without significant benefits,5 and they have policed 2 3 CFR 323 (1985). 3 3 CFR 638 (1993). 
4 See, e.g., Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA, 947 F.2d 1201 (9th Cir. 1991); Competitive Enterprise Institute v. NHTSA, 984 F.2d 123 (1992). 
5 American Petroleum Institute, 448 US 148 (1980); Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA, 947 F.2d 1201 (9th Cir. 1991); AFL-CIO v. OSHA, 965 F.2d 962 (11th Cir. 1992). agency action to ensure at least a rough kind of proportionality between costs and benefits. Sometimes courts have been quite aggressive in requiring proportionality as part of their function in reviewing agency action to test whether it is โarbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.โ6 
These developments have not meant that the regulatory state is now routinely subject to scrutiny for conformity with costbenefit criteria (a vague notion, as we shall see). In fact it is not. Presidents and courts of course have sharply limited authority; they must act consistently with federal statutes, which often forbid cost-benefit balancing. Consider, for example, the Clear Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Delaney Clause, and the Safe Water Drinking Act, many of whose provisions ban agencies from balancing costs against benefits. It is partly for this reason that the American regulatory state contains many regulations imposing costs not justified by benefits.7 From existing evidence8 it is possible, moreover, to conclude that in spite of the recent executive orders, efforts at cost-benefit balancing within the executive branch have been sporadic and episodic, and that the highly publicized executive orders have served a largely symbolic and aspirational function. Hence much of the contemporary interest in regulatory reform is directed toward Congress. 
It is important to say that the national legislature has not uniformly rejected cost-benefit balancing. Some statutes enacted by Congress appear to contemplate a form of cost-benefit analysis.9 More recently, the Unfunded Mandates Act contains two potentially relevant โsleeperโ provisions, both receiving almost no public attention even from specialists, and both growing out of the Contract With America. First, significant regulatory actions must be accompanied by a statement that includes โa qualitative and quantitative assessment of the anticipated costs and benefits of the Federal mandate.โ10 Under the second provision, all agencies must โidentify and consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives and from those alternatives select the least costly, most cost-effective, or least burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives of the rule.โ11 There is an exception if these steps are inconsistent with law or if the agency explains why it has not chosen that least burdensome alternative; but this provision could have significant consequences. 
In 1995, Congress nearly enacted a new statute that would amend all regulatory statutes to contain a cost-benefit โsupermandate.โ If this statute had been enacted, laws now calling for various forms of absolutism, or indifference to cost, would call for cost-benefit balancing.12 The failure to enact a new reform statute in 1995 has spurred fresh interest in solutions to modern regulatory problems. 
Cost-benefit requirements are of course most easily justified on economic grounds, as a way of promoting economic efficiency and thus eliminating unnecessary and wasteful public and private expenditures. But cost-benefit requirements also have strong democratic justifications. Indeed, they can be understood as a way of diminishing interest-group pressures on regulation and also as a method for ensuring that the consequences of regulation are not shrouded in mystery but are instead made available for public inspection and review. Some of the strongest arguments for cost-benefit requirements are not so much economic as democratic in character. 
cost-benefit state should be qualified by reference to three points, and I urge that these points should be kept in mind during the process of regulatory reform. First, cost-benefit analysis ought not to be taken to impose undue procedural requirements on agencies. Government inaction has costs of its own; it may allow severe 10 2 USC 202(a)( 11 2 USC 202 (a)( 
12 See Cass R. Sunstein, Congress, Constitutional Moments, and the Cost-Benefit State, 48 Stan L Rev 247 (1995). problems to continue; and some forms of cost-benefit analysis actually fail cost-benefit analysis. They impose extensive informational demands on agencies. They create excessive delay. They obstruct desirable regulation. Thus efforts at regulatory reform should avoid the pervasive risk of excessive proceduralism. 
The second point stems from the fact that some of the most promising strategies for regulatory reform require a shift from command-and-control regulation to economic incentives. In these circumstances, cost-benefit analysis should not be taken as a modest, procedural step designed to engraft new informationgathering requirements on top of existing regulatory tools. On the contrary, it should be part and parcel of a more ambitious and thorough-going effort to move toward new and better tools, often replacing federal command and control with disclosure remedies and with economic incentives. The shift from command-andcontrol to more flexible methods of obtaining regulatory goals should, in short, be a central part of the cost-benefit state. 
Third, any transformation of the modern regulatory state should recognize that by itself, the bare idea of cost-benefit analysis lacks a theory of how, and how much, to value social goods. Balancing all relevant variables is of course sensible; but which variables are relevant, and how should they be valued? Economists have some instructive answers, and I will discuss some of those answers below. But in its most rigidly economistic forms, cost-benefit analysis raises serious problems, since it values all regulatory consequences under the rubric of private โwillingness to pay.โ The willingness to pay criterion has many uses, and sometimes it should indeed be the foundation for decision. But that criterion does not capture all of the values that underlay modern regulation, and sometimes it should be used only to provide information, and not as the foundation for decision. I attempt to explain below how this point bears on regulatory reform. 
Emerging national enthusiasm for cost-benefit balancing should be understood against the backdrop set by Franklin Delano Rooseveltโs New Deal, which was of course a substantial reformation of the original constitutional structure.13 The New Deal qualifies as a substantial reformation above all because it refashioned the three basic cornerstones of that structure: federalism; checks and balances; and individual rights. 
To compress a long story: In the 1930s the powers of the national government were expanded in an extraordinary way, to the point where the nation exercised something close to general authority to control whatever problems it sought to address. The framersโ original understanding of a sharply constrained central government was therefore repudiated by the nation. There were simple grounds for this repudiation. State autonomy seemed an obstacle to democratic self-government, not a crucial part of itโ especially in the midst of the Depression, when states were generally perceived as ineffectual entities buffeted about by private factions. (Of course we have come to see that the national government may suffer from the same problem.) As a result of the New Deal, state autonomy was very different in 1940 from what it had been in 1920. 
During the New Deal, the system of checks and balances also came under sharp criticism. To many observers, especially during the Depression, that system seemed dysfunctional for modern society.14 Good businesses do not operate through checks and balances; why should good governments paralyze themselves in this way? Responding to such questions, Congress delegated enormous, often open-ended policymaking power to the President and also created a large number of powerful executive and independent agencies. Crucially, Congress attempted to design these agencies so as to limit the consequences of the system of checks and balances by allowing a high degree of administrative autonomy. Thus the new agencies had a large degree of discretionary authority under open-ended statutory standards. They also combined traditionally separated powers of 13 See B. Ackerman, We the People vol. 1 (1993) (discussing New Deal as creation of third American constitutional regime). I borrow in this and the following section from Sunstein, Congress, Constitutional Moments, and the Cost-Benefit State, supra note. 
14 See James Landis, The Administrative Process (1935), for the classic statement. adjudication, execution, and legislation. Certainly they were not limited by requirements of cost-benefit analysis. 
These institutional shifts resulted from a central national judgment made during the Depression: that individual rights, properly conceived, included not merely the common law catalogue of private interests but also governmental protection against many of the harms and risks of a market economy. The common law was a regulatory system enjoying no special status. It should be evaluated pragmatically in terms of its consequences for the human beings subject to it. Here it often seemed to fail. 
An astonishing feature of the New Deal was its relative rapidity. Many of the changes came in the brief period from 1932 through 1936. Rapid change was possible partly because it is a relatively simple step for a legislature to create a range of new bureaucratic institutions, at least if the legislature does not specify their duties in advance. The New Deal entities in fact operated pursuant to little statutory guidance; Congress usually contented itself with open-ended delegations of authority. 
The New Deal reformation was the foundation for the basic orientation of the national government until the election of President Ronald Reagan, and possibly since then. One development has been of special importance: the โrights revolutionโ of the 1 9 6 0 s and 1 9 7 0 s. During that period, many New Deal tendencies were largely reinforced through the creation of a remarkable array of new agencies. These agencies were designed mostly to protect against threats to life, health, and safety from consumer products, workplaces, and above all the environment in general.15 Hence this period saw the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Consumer Protect Safety Commission, the Council on Environmental Quality, and more. 
It is notable that during both the New Deal and the rights revolution, no mechanism was created to evaluate regulatory performance. There was no system to assess whether agencies were making things better or worse. In the New Deal, any such system might have seemed peculiar in light of the widespread national enthusiasm for the President and for the possibilities of 15 See Cass R. Sunstein, After the Rights Revolution (1990). benign administration. Of course cost-benefit thinking was quite foreign to political actors, and hence cost-benefit analysisโwhich in any case had not been โinventedโ in anything like its current formโplayed little or no role in the public debate. 
An especially striking feature of the period since 1980 is that the New Deal reformation has been subject to sustained national criticism, often as a result of a form of โnational performance reviewโ in which cost-benefit analysis plays a prominent role. It is worthwhile to pause over the constitution-like character of recent challenges to the current regulatory arrangements. Often it is suggested that the national government has far exceeded the appropriate limits of its authority, and that a return to the original structure would make a great deal of sense. 
In this way there is a wholesale attack on the existing allocation of authority between the national government and the states. But โhorizontalโ issues of government structure are receiving similar attention. Many people have expressed concern about the extent of policymaking discretion given to regulatory agencies.16 In their view, Congress should reassert its constitutional prerogatives by narrowing administrative discretion. Hence it is urged that the New Dealโs enthusiasm for independent bureaucracy, and for a large lawmaking role by executive agencies, should be revisited, and that Congress should make the fundamental choices of policy. 
Finally, and perhaps most fundamentally, pre-New Deal principles of private right have enjoyed a rebirth with the suggestion that modern regulatory programs violate liberty, rightly conceived.17 Thus the movement for deregulation has called for far more sweeping changes than were urged in the Reagan period itself. Thus the takings clause has become a rallying cry for a new enthusiasm for the protection of private propertyโa rallying cry that has been brought by way of challenge to such wellestablished federal programs as the Endangered Species Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Actโs protection of wetlands. 16 David Schoenbrod, Power Without Responsibility (1994). 
17 See Richard Epstein, Simple Rules for a Complex World (1995). 
Some of the criticisms of regulatory performance have been far more pragmatic in character, and it is here that cost-benefit balancing, accompanied by risk analysis, has played a special role. As I have noted, the New Deal period was accompanied by no mechanism for monitoring regulatory performance. But it is now suggested that national government has failed adequately to perform the tasks assigned to it and that it has often made things worse. In this view, there is no suggestion that markets are ideal; but often markets work better than the regulatory programs designed as solutions. In sum, the question is whether the benefits justify the costs. 
In the last decade, something very close to a consensus has emerged on some of the most important problems in existing government regulation. If government were to act on this consensus, it would introduce important changes. The consensus has the following features. 
There can be no doubt that resources for risk reduction are badly allocated.18 As much as $500 billion may be spent each year on regulation (putting benefits to one side),19 and of this amount, more than $130 billion is spent on environmental protection.20 A recent study suggests that better allocations of existing health expenditures could save an additional 6 0 ,0 0 0 lives at no increased costโand that with better allocations, we could save the same number of lives we now save with $31 billion in annual savings.21 
There are also serious and apparently unjustified asymmetries in life-saving expenditures. For transportation, there is a median per life year saved of $56,000; for occupational regulation, the number is $3 4 6 ,0 0 0 ; for environmental regulation, it is $4,207,000.22 There are enormous variations within each group as well. Annual lives saved are highly variable.2 3 Of course calculations of costs and benefits are somewhat speculative, and these numbers are of uncertain reliability. But with better allocations and more deliberative judgments, much could be done to make things better by providing more protection at identical cost. 
It is well-known that cost per life saved tables show enormous and highly suggestive2 4 : disparities across programs. Some regulations cost $100,000 or less per life saved; a number cost less than $1 million; many cost between $1 million and $5 million; and many range between $5 million and over $1 billion per life saved. A single number would not make sense, for reasons that we will explore; but these differences suggest that priorities are not being set in a sensible fashion. 
The goal of achieving good priority-setting is undermined by the fact that agencies have quite different standards for deciding when risks are large enough to require any regulation at all.25 The International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends that environmental factors should not be allowed to cause an incremental cancer risk, for those exposed over a lifetime, of about 3 in 1 0 0 0 . American agencies do not follow this recommendation, and their own practices are highly variable. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission sees 1 in 1000 as acceptable; the EPAโs acceptable range varies from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 1,000,000. 22 Id. 23 W. Kip Viscusi, Fatal Tradeoffs, supra, at 264. 
24 No more than that. To know whether there is cost-effectiveness, it is necessary to know more than cost per life saved. It is necessary to know as well (at a minimum) cost per unit of benefit; and benefits might include morbidity as well as mortality gains, improvements in recreation, mortality and morbidity gains for plants and animals, and improvements in aesthetics. 
25 See Sadowitz and Graham, A Survey of Permitted Residual Cancer Risks, 6 RISK 17 (1995). The FDA has tried to use a standard of 1 in 1 million, but under the Delaney Clause, courts have required a standard of essentially 0.26 OSHAโs understanding of the โsignificant riskโ requirement found in its governing statute means a risk of 1 in 1000; labor groups have sought an increase to 1 in 1 million. In the face of these variations, sensible priority-setting is unlikely. 
market-based incentives rather than rigid commands. 
Too often government has chosen to regulate through rigid commands that forbid more flexible and cost-effective means for achieving the same goal. In air and water pollution control, serious problems are caused by the โbest available technologyโ approach, which mandates control technologies for hundreds or even thousands of firms in an exceptionally diverse nation. Compare market-based systems, which do not mandate particular results but instead impose costs on those who contribute to social harms. Consider, for example, a gasoline tax or an emissions trading system, by which people are allocated licenses that they can trade at a market price. Through such strategies, billions of dollars might be saved.27 
Existing efforts at seeking better regulatory tools are hobbled by the statutory status quo, which sometimes forbids such tools, and which sometimes requires that they be engrafted on a bureaucratically complex system.28 Thus a 1989 study suggested that the EPAโs emissions trading program had saved between $ 5 2 5 million and $12 billion per year.2 9 Thus the Clinton Administration calculates that its market-oriented proposals for amending the Clean Water Act could save between $1 and $1 2 billion over alternative approaches. Thus studies show that incentive-based mechanisms for controlling air pollution could have accomplished the same amount at one-quarter the cost.30 
An especially valuable incentive-based approach consists of disclosure of information. Government might disclose risk-related information on its own, as it has in the case of cigarette smoking, or it might require companies to provide such information to workers and consumers. If, for example, companies offer information about risk, consumer and worker behavior will probably be affected. The national government has offered many initiatives in this direction. In particular, the Toxic Release Inventory of the Superfund Amendments appears to have been highly successful, spurring voluntary reductions at relatively low cost, and without requiring governmental mandates.31 A great deal of work remains to be done in conceiving and designing appropriate informational approaches to risk. 
harmful unintended consequences. 
Many regulatory initiatives have unintended harmful consequences, and under existing institutions, there is no systematic way to ensure that those consequences receive attention. Hence regulation tends to be based on partial perspectives emerging from close attention to mere pieces of complex problems. Selective attention is a hallmark of almost all current institutional arrangements. 
A particular problem arises from โhealth-healthโ tradeoffs, which arise when regulation of one health risk increases another health risk.32 It is important to ensure that risk regulation does not actually increase risks on balance. Suppose, for example, that elimination of asbestosโa carcinogenic substanceโmakes cars less safe, because asbestos is the best substance to use in making brake linings. Or suppose that the ban on asbestos encourages companies to use even more dangerous substitutes. It is pervasively true that controls on one risk may increase another risk. Unfortunately, risk regulation is not designed with this problem in mind. 
There is also an incipient literature suggesting that regulatory expenditures can actually cost lives, since regulatory expenditures can produce greater unemployment and hence poverty, and since poor people do not live as long as people who are not poor. A 1990 study attempted to develop a model to quantify the common sense view that โricher is safer.โ33 According to Keeney, a single fatality might result from an expenditure of from $3 million to $7.5 million. In a concurring opinion in a 1 9 9 1 case involving occupational safety and health regulation, Judge Williams invoked this evidence to suggest that OSHAโs refusal to engage in cost-benefit analysis might not be beneficial for workers.34 Judge Williams reasoned that if a fatality results from an expenditure of $7.5 million, some regulations might produce more fatalities than they prevent. Many regulations of course cost more than $7.5 million per life saved (see Table 1). In Judge Williamsโ view, an agency that fails to measure costs against benefits might be failing to measure mortality gains against losses. 
The claimed relationship between wealth reductions and mortality is controversial.35 But a number of studies find such a relationship. Consider the summary in Table 1.36 
These findings should be taken with many grains of salt; existing evidence is in its infancy. In particular, there is reason to believe that expenditures that reduce the income of poor people have far more serious mortality effects than expenditures that reduce the income of rich people.37 In any case it would certainly be good for government to know about unintended adverse consequences and to try to counteract them to the extent feasible. There is now no systematic mechanism by which government regulators can be made attentive to harmful unintended consequences. 
better incentives to compile and provide accurate information. 
Often government lacks information about the harms that regulation is designed to counteract. Often it must act, or fail to act, in a context of a considerable scientific uncertainty. It follows that 
37 See Chapman & Hariharan, Do Poor People Have a Stronger Relationship between Income and Mortality Than the Rich?, 12 J Risk & Uncertainty 51 (1996). any exercise of quantification can be illusory, or at least give the impression of far more knowledge than people actually have. 
In these circumstances government should put a high premium on acquiring as much accurate information as possible. Much of the relevant information can be found in the private sector, which is in the best position to know about the costs of controlling risks and about actual emissions levels. The current regulatory structure does not create good incentives for compiling accurate information on these counts; indeed, it creates incentives to distort the facts. Hence industry faces incentives to report that the costs will be far higher than they will actually be.38 It certainly does not encounter proper incentives to compile more information than is now available. Of course there is an omnipresent risk that governmental risk analysis will be skewed by well-organized private interests. 
38 See, e.g., Cotton Dust: An OSHA Success Story?, in W. Kip Viscusi, Fatal Tradeoffs (discussing the extreme overstatement of compliance costs by industry). 
their appropriate place. 
It seems clear that government should respond to reasonable judgments about risk; but whose judgments should be counted as reasonable? Countless studies have shown that there are systematic differences between expert and citizen judgments about risk.39 This is one of the most robust findings in an extensive literature. Consider Table 2. 
What is the reason for these differences? Some of them are attributable to citizensโ ignorance of the facts. The ignorance has many sources, including sensationalistic media reports and heuristics that produce systematic biases.40 Thus people tend to think that an event is more likely when it is โavailable,โ that is, when its occurrence can come readily to mind. It may be for this reason that people think that deaths from accidents occur much more often than deaths from disease, when in fact the numbers are about the same. The availability heuristic suggests that what people think will be partly an artifact of what the media emphasize. Notably, the media tend to emphasize unusual and provocative events rather than chronic risks.4 1 The result is substantial distortions in policy, reflected in the โpollutant of the monthโ syndrome that characterizes regulatory responses.

When citizens misperceive the facts, government should not respond to them. Citizen judgments that are based on mistaken beliefs should be corrected through education. And when they are mistaken, government should try to act on the basis of reality rather than fiction. For public judgments to govern, it is important to ensure that they are undergirded by sound science, as opposed to sensationalistic anecdotes or scare tactics. There is nothing undemocratic about a governmental refusal to respond to a demand for regulation that is based on factual ignorance. On the contrary, a system of representative democracy has as one of its central justifications the โfilteringโ of ignorant judgments. 
But this is only part of the story. Some of the differences between citizens and experts have nothing to do with misunderstanding of the facts; they involve values instead. Experts focus principally on aggregate lives at stake. By contrast, ordinary citizens care about a range of other variables: whether risks are equitably distributed, faced by future generations, especially dreaded, well-understood, and voluntarily incurred.42 The psychological research can be summarized in the following way: 
Qualitative distinctions of this kind do not play a role in expert assessments. But citizen judgments on these points are entirely reasonable. They deserve respect, at least in a democracy. It is therefore important to ensure that any regulatory reform takes account of public judgments about which risks are most severeโso long as those judgments are both reflective and informed. 
on means. 
A pervasive problem in federal regulation arises when regulatory policy becomes an arena for interest-group struggle. This happened most famously with efforts in 1977 to use the Clean Air Act to promote the interests of eastern coal43 and, in 1990, with interest-group lobbying on behalf of ethanol and other parochial interests.4 4 Interest-group maneuvering is an omnipresent issue in federal regulation. 
It is possible to limit interest-group powerโand at the same time to reduce costโthrough legislative attention to ends rather than to means of achieving those ends. When Congress focuses on ends, it makes it less likely that interest-group struggle over means will convert regulation into a struggle among groups with high stakes in particular means. And when Congress focuses on ends, it makes it more likely that the democratic process will be attending to the important questions. Thus โperformance standardsโ are generally better than โdesign standards.โ What matters is whether the level of emissions is low or high, not whether the relevant company has installed scrubbers. In general, Congress should let administrators decide on the appropriate means for reaching legislatively-decreed ends, and administrators should, to the extent feasible, be permitted to rely on market forces to choose those means. If an industry can comply with a sulfur dioxide emission standard with clean coal, or with energy conservation methods, government should be entirely satisfied. 
These, then, are the principal lessons of the last generation of experience with regulation. If we keep them in mind, we might think that it is well past time to enact what might be described metaphorically as an Administrative Substance Act, complementing the Administrative Procedure Act, which now governs agency behavior. The point of such an act would be to capture new learning with respect to regulatory successes and failures. 
In light of these considerations, a new and general requirement of (some form of) cost-benefit balancing seems a natural corrective. Indeed, such a requirement might well ensuring close attention to real-world consequences as these can be understood through the most sophisticated regulatory tools. For committed technocrats, the idea is to discipline the administrative state by assessing actual effects. Where the costs of regulation are low and the benefits high, nothing is wrong with regulation.54 The second strand is reactionary: an effort to eliminate regulation whether or not it can be justified. Here costbenefit requirements are combined with detailed procedural and information-gathering burdens, and also (ironically) with limits on appropriationsโlimits that will make it harder for agencies to comply with their new duties. Here the goal is not to improve but to obstruct regulation. Thus recent reform proposals have included blanket moratoriums on new regulations (a truly crude and lazy strategy for โreformโ) and costly โlook backโ provisions requiring agencies to do extended analyses of old regulations and to defend those analyses in court. 
In the 1 9 9 0 s, enthusiasm for cost-benefit balancing has stemmed from both technocrats and reactionaries.55 Mutually beneficial alliances are certainly possible. Good technocrats knows that regulation often makes little sense, and good reactionaries know that cost-benefit analysis can slow down regulation. But for those interested in public-spirited regulatory reform, the task for the future is to ensure that technocratic goals predominate. Otherwise cost-benefit analysis will simply serve as an obstacle to regulation whether or not it is desirable. If this happens, costbenefit analysis, as a tool for decisionmakers, will ultimately breed public cynicism and distrust. This would be a disaster for those who seek to improve administrative performance. 
For current reformers, a central problem is that cost-benefit analysis can result in excessive proceduralismโin the form of delay and paperwork requirements unaccompanied by corresponding gain. It should be unnecessary to emphasize that cost-benefit requirements can impose costly procedural duties on agencies, and sometimes it is not clear that those duties produce benefits that justify the costs. Cost-benefit analysis will, in some forms, fail cost-benefit analysis. 
There are two more particular problems here. First: If agencies are required to compile and compare the costs and benefits of every possible variation on a proposal under review, they will spend all their time calculating costs and benefits, and there will be a large incentive to stick with the status quo whatever its content. Existing procedural requirements have sometimes had just this effect. If cost-benefit analysis is supposed to be an engine for reform, status quo bias would be ironic unintended consequence.56 Second: If agencies are required to defend all their rules, including existing rules, in complex administrative processes and eventually in court, they may spend all their resources in the defense of rules and hence in the employment of lawyers. Private cooptation of regulatory resources is a serious risk in proposals that subject agency decisions to excessive judicial control. 
Take the first problem first. We can get some purchase on the problem by observing that in recent judicial decisions under statutes that call for balancing, there has been a tendency to require agencies to calculate the costs and benefits of a wide range of alternative proposals.57 Naturally agencies resist this step, sometimes with the plausible argument that the gain of additional information is not worth the costs of acquiring it (including the costs of maintaining the status quo in the reviewing period). To be sure, the agency might be acting arbitrarily if it makes this decision; perhaps it has failed to investigate an alternative that is much better and that can be investigated cheaply. But courts are in a poor position to know whether this is so, and in general their own institutional ignorance ought to lead them to accept an agencyโs argument to this effect unless the argument can be shown to be unreasonable. 
A broad lesson emerges from this conclusion. Agencies may well be reluctant to devote their resources to exploring the costs 56 See the discussion of status quo bias in J. Mashaw and D. Harfst, The Struggle For Auto Safety (1990). 
57 Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA, 947 F.2d 1201 (9th Cir. 1991). See also AFL-CIO, supra note. and benefits of, say, ten alternatives to the proposal under discussion, on the theory that the costs of the exploration would not justify the benefits. From this point we can conclude that any legislative requirement of cost-benefit balancing should give agencies some room to allocate resources as they wishโincluding the investigatory resources that are involved in cost-benefit analysis itself. 
Now turn to the second problem. It is easy to understand the impetus toward proposals to require agencies to review existing rules. Many such rules no longer make sense; changed circumstances have made them obsolete or even counterproductive.58 Thus a presidential dictate to agencies to ensure against obsolescence would be highly desirable. It would be even better for agencies to adopt rules that are likely to make sense over time, as in consensus standards that draw on private practices or, even better, performance standards that do not make it necessary for agencies to change so rapidly over time. Good technocrats are well-disposed toward ideas of this sort. 
But a special problem will be created if Congress requires agencies to โlook backโ and review the costs and benefits of existing rules and to defend their analyses in court. Hence the โlook backโ idea creates real risks; it may allow private parties to coopt public resources by requiring endless reviews of old rules. There is no assurance that any private right to require new assessments of such rules will make much sense. It is easy to imagine a system in private groups are allowed to challenge analyses not so as to ensure better policy analysis, but so as to fend off and delay sensible regulatory initiatives. Of course this happens all the time. In the last generation, expensive procedural requirements have produced a kind of โossificationโ of rulemaking, in which agencies are deterred from proceeding at all, and ultimately pushed toward less effective alternatives. 
Alert to these problems, Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton did not allow their executive orders to be reviewable by courts. Hence the requirements of these executive orders play no role in court, and cost-benefit balancing has been a matter for agencies alone (except to the extent that governing statutes mandate cost-benefit balancing). For the future it probably makes sense to allow court review to ensure that agency judgments about costs and benefits are not arbitrary. It also seems reasonable for presidents to impose on agencies a duty to ensure against obsolete regulations. But it probably does not make sense to surround the process with โlook backโ requirements designed to enable courts to require agencies to do cost-benefit analyses of past rules. Of course this is an issue that cannot be settled through first principles; it has large empirical dimensions. A degree of experimentation would be desirable before Congress attempts a statutory solution. 
Congress is now considering proposals to amend many existing statutes to call for cost-benefit analysis. As we have seen, some such shift is quite promising. A number of statutes forbid balancing and call for absolutism,59 and such approaches are not easy to justify. Moreover, it is important to offer some criteria by which to monitor regulatory performance, and cost-benefit analysis is probably the best available technique for embarking on a form of โnational performance reviewโ in the regulatory context. 
Standing by itself, however, a shift in the direction of costbenefit analysis would be only a modest improvement over the status quo. Unless it is understood in a particular wayโas a part of and a stimulus to a far larger change in directionโa decision to engraft a cost-benefit requirement onto current law would represent an insufficiently fundamental departure from the system of command and control regulation. In fact a skeptic might say that by itself, a requirement of cost-benefit analysis allows legislators to take credit for โgetting the regulators under controlโ without forcing them to make hard choices, which would remain left to agencies and the President. This credit-claiming device can hardly substitute for fundamental reform. 
16 USC 1531-1544, the Delaney Clause, 21 USC 348(C)( 
Imagineโto take a rough analogyโif the Soviet Union had decided (in, say, 1986) to replace an โabsolutistโ five-year plan for producing wheat with another five-year plan, one that better recognized the need for balancing competing variables. This step might well have been an improvement; but a five-year plan based on governmental balancing is no less a five-year plan than one based on governmental absolutism. Governmental dictation of outcomes rooted in cost-benefit analysis is better than governmental dictation based on absolutism, but neither is ideal. 
In fact it would be easy to imagine a generation of dreary cycles with respect to regulatory reform. In those cycles, conservatives might require more balancing, more procedures, and fewer deadlines for administrators; liberals then argue against cost-benefit analysis and for solely health-based or solely technology-based standards, fewer procedures, citizen suits for regulatory beneficiaries, and stricter deadlines; conservatives, a few years later, seek greater procedural requirements and more attention to costs; liberals respond with the familiar litany; and so on until, say, 2 0 5 0 . Something of this kind is not a bad description of regulatory debates since 1980. But its continuation would represent an enormous failure of imagination and creativity. It would fix American policy in outmoded debates of the early 1970s, before the outpouring of learning that makes the โmoreโ or โlessโ debate seem to unhelpful. 
A cost-benefit state ought not to content itself with governmental specification of outcomes after governmental costbenefit judgments. It ought instead t o e n c o u r a g e nongovernmental actors to generate information and to produce outcomes on the basis of incentives produced by democratic j u d g m e n t s . For example, a great advantage of economic incentives and disclosure remedies is that they reduce the informational burden on government and shift that burden to people who know relevant costs and benefits. Instead of requiring a certain technology for carsโa question that government is illequipped to answerโgovernment might impose a fee or a tax on high-polluting vehicles. The latter strategy imposes a far less severe information-gathering burden on government, which no longer need choose among technologies. That choice would be made by the (legally constrained) market. 
As I have suggested, cost-benefit analysis, properly understood, should help spur use of better regulatory tools. It should be understood as part of a general movement away from command-and-control regulation. I will return to this point below. 
Advocates of cost-benefit analysis have urged Congress to enact a โsubstantive supermandateโ requiring all agencies to calculate costs and benefits and even to make cost-benefit analysis the โdecisional criterion.โ Enough has been said thus far to suggest why such proposals are attractive. But how, exactly, are costs and benefits to be valued? Should market failure, as defined by economists, be the basis for understanding all of government regulation? These points raise large questions about the foundations of the modern regulatory state. In this section I suggest reasons for caution about the traditional economic understanding of regulation, but nonetheless endorse a shift in the direction of a substantive supermandate. 
If a substantive supermandate is to be superimposed on the regulatory state, it makes sense to try to understand what costbenefit balancing actually entails. Much of the national debate in recent years has involved the value of cost-benefit analysisโwith proponents seeing cost-benefit analysis as a method for disciplinary administrative power by calling for salutary balancing, and adversaries fearing that cost-benefit analysis is a coldhearted way of sacrificing human health and life for the sake of mere dollars. But this is at best a caricature. By itself, the notion of cost-benefit analysis is very close to empty; everything depends on how costs and benefits are characterized and on how underlying issues of valuation are resolved. 
In fact there are two sorts of criticisms that might be made of a proposed framework (or supermandate) for evaluating governmental performance. One sort of criticism is that the framework is wrongโthat it ignores certain important variables, or that it is founded on an indefensible theory of value. Another sort of criticism is that it is incompletely specifiedโthat its meaning depends on further subsidiary judgments that have yet to be offered. Cost-benefit analysis is properly subject to the first kind of criticism to the extent that it purports to align all social values along the single metric of aggregated private willingness to pay, and to evaluate all social and economic regulation by reference to that criterion. Inventive economists have devised many intriguing methods for discerning the โshadow pricesโ of goods not normally traded on markets; such methods have their uses, but their value and limitation result from their foundations in the idea of private willingness to pay. Regulation may be rooted in redistributive rather than allocative goals, and for fully legitimate reasons; consider the anti-discrimination laws as examples. To the extent that cost-benefit analysis is rooted in the technical economistsโ understanding, it has a great deal to offer, but it cannot capture all of the appropriate goals of regulation.60 
As a political creedโas it operates within Congress and the executive branchโthe principal problem with cost-benefit analysis is that it is incompletely specified. Its meaning depends on how costs and benefits are characterized and on how issues of valuation are resolved. Are equitable concerns a part of costbenefit analysis? Suppose, for example, that a certain environmental risk is concentrated among African-Americans. Can a good cost-benefit analysis take this into account? (We should hope so, whatever private willingness to pay may suggest.) Or suppose that some of the benefits of regulation are aesthetic. How will these benefits be valued? Of course there is an extensive literature on valuation of human life and environmental goods.61 By itself cost-benefit analysis does not take a stand on the associated controversies; but regulators must take some such stand. My suggestion here is that it is always appropriate to identify costs and benefits so as to inform analysis, and even to require that benefits justify costs, but that regulators should not claim that benefits and costs must be grounded in traditional economic criteria involving private willingness to pay. 
The modern state includes a diverse array of regulatory statutes, with diverse legitimate purposes, including but not at all limited to economic efficiency. Consider the following: Many important regulatory statutes are of course plausibly understood in terms of economic efficiency; they can be seen as efforts to counteract market failures. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act are examples. Such statutes may be designed to overcome an absence of sufficient information; harms to third parties; or collective action problems of various sorts. 
Some statutes are designed to eliminate illegitimate discrimination. Though some people think that such statutes can be defended on efficiency grounds,6 2 their animating impulse has little to do with economic efficiency. They should be understood as an effort to eliminate second-class citizenship for members of certain social groups. Of course this does not mean that cost is no object. Such statutes should have cost-effectiveness as a goal, and effects on productivity are not irrelevant. 
Some statutes are designed to protect cultural aspirations.63 Examples include measures safeguarding the national parks, encouraging high-quality programming, and protecting endangered species. 
Some statutes are designed to transform preferences, perhaps by altering existing social norms that press choices in a particular direction. When choices are a product of reputational incentives and hence social norms, and when those choices shorten lives, government might attempt to r e s p o n d . 6 4 Regulation involving smoking, recycling, educational programming, and sexual harassment can be understood in these terms. 
Some statutes are designed to redistribute resources to the poor or to others understood as having a good claim to public help. To be sure, regulation is a poor tool for this purpose, and purportedly public-spirited redistribution may really be benefiting well-organized interest groups with little claim to public assistance. But redistribution plays a large role in modern administration. The Social Security Act is an obvious example of redistributive law; the Agricultural Adjustment Act can be understood in this way, with appropriate qualifications for its interest-group dimensions. 
It would undoubtedly be possible to mention other possibilities. The point is that the highly diverse grounds for federal regulation raise questions about cost-benefit analysis as the sole basis for regulationโand even about identifying costs and benefits as such in a value-free way. 
If it is intended as an amendment to the regulatory state, a cost-benefit supermandate could be understood in many different ways. In its most ambitious form, it would amount to an endorsement of the principle of economic efficiency as the exclusive basisโthe โdecisional criterionโโfor interpretation and application of all statutes. This would be a fundamental change both because it would understand cost-benefit analysis in a particular wayโas a term for the criterion of economic efficiencyโand because it would amend statutes that, when enacted, seemed motivated by something other than the efficiency criterion. If this were the understanding of the supermandate, all of the statutes to which the supermandate applies would henceforth be understood in efficiency terms. To say the least, this would be a dramatic shift in national policies and practices. 
Another, less ambitious possibility is that the cost-benefit criteria would be understood in efficiency terms, but only for those statutes that were originally designed to promote economic efficiency. Under this approach, a cost-benefit supermandate would not alter the basic understandings that underlie existing statutes. It would instead have a more modest but nonetheless important goal: imposing a particular understanding of rationality on statutes formerly understood and implemented in a less precise, more ad hoc, and more intuitive way. 
A third and least ambitious possibility is that cost-benefit criteria would be understood in a less technical and more common-sensical way, as an invitation to balancing a range of variables under statutes that had formerly been thought to be absolutist and hence to forbid balancing. On this view, a supermandate would not be so ambitious as to call for use of purely economic criteria. Its more modest goal would be to ask administrators to look at costs, or adverse effects, as well as at benefits. This has probably been the goal of the majority of those members of Congress who have been in favor of a substantive supermandate. And if the supermandate is understood in these terms, it makes a great deal of sense. As we will see, the principal objection to such a supermandate is that it is too open-ended; Congress can and should take steps to make it clearer, thoughโI emphasizeโwithout mandating the efficiency criterion outside of the context of โmarket failureโ statutes. 
In legislative proposals dealing with cost-benefit analysis, almost no guidance has been offered on the crucial issue of how to value relevant variables. For this reason the provisions look highly substantive but are in fact largely procedural. Without guidance to constrain valuation, a requirement of cost-benefit analysis is quite open-ended. 
To be sure, it would be possible to conclude that Congress should restrict itself to a call for cost-benefit analysis and leave the details to agencies. Perhaps Congress lacks the detailed understanding that would enable it to answer the more specific questions. Moreover, an open-ended mandate would certainly not be meaningless. It would send agencies a signal about the need for balancing a range of considerations, and any such procedural requirement will affect outcomes. Courts may invalidate outcomes that, by general understandings, seem out of line with existing practice or too absolutist.65 Certainly there is a difference between agency behavior under balancing statutes and agency behavior under statutes that forbid balancing.66 But those concerned about administrative discretion would urge some greater guidance from the national legislature. I offer two suggestions here. 
care not simply about aggregate amount of lives lived, but also about a range of factors involving the nature of the particular risk. For most people, among the most salient contextual features are: ( uncontrollable; ( permanent losses; ( how equitably distributed the danger is or how concentrated on identifiable, innocent, or traditionally disadvantaged victims; ( how well understood the risk in question is; ( would be faced by future generations; and ( is. Many of these factors are reflected in the willingness to pay criterion.67 
Any required cost-benefit analysis for diverse regulatory agencies should reflect these points. Any cost-benefit analysis should, moreover, be accompanied by a more disaggregated and more qualitative description of the consequences of government action, so that Congress and the public can obtain a fuller picture than the crude and misleadingly precise โbottom lineโ of the costbenefit analysis. This is not at all to deny that it is important to be precise and quantitative when agencies can be precise and quantitative. It is only to say that any โbottom lineโ about how to characterize and assess costs and benefits will involve judgments about values, not about science, and Congress and the public should see what those judgments are.

It is of course troublesome to assign dollar values for life, partly for the reasons I have sketched; but since tradeoffs of multiple kinds are inevitable, it may be best for Congress to set out some guidelines, floors, and ceilings governing expenditures, without pretending to say how much a life is โreally worth.โ In light of the diversity of regulated risks, no single number would make sense for valuing life. It may well make sense to set benchmark standards of, say, $10 million per life saved as the maximum amount and $3 million as the minimum. These benchmarks might be accompanied by explicit permission for agencies to select a lower or higher number if the agency can explain that special circumstances call for that higher number. On this view, the data emerging from studies of revealed preferences would be used not because it reflects โactualโ or acontextual valuations, but because for pragmatic purposes, it provides a good place to start, one that is better supported and more usable than any available alternative. 
There is crudeness, however, in the very notion of โdollars per life saved.โ A well-functioning regulatory state should not be interested in how many lives are saved. but in how many statistical years, or how many decently livable statistical years, are added by regulation.68 Hence Congress might set floors and ceilings not for lives saved but for life-years saved, with permission to depart on the basis of justifications that are publicly articulated and are reasonable on the merits. 
Without a figure per life or per โquality life yearโ saved, agencies effectively have discretion to weight costs and benefits however they wish; this is a good reason for Congress to offer some guidelines. At a minimum Congress should require agencies to be explicit about their valuations, so that what they do will be subject to legislative and public oversight and review. 
We have seen that there is a pervasive problem in risk regulation, one that is only now receiving public attention. The problem occurs when the diminution of one risk simultaneously increases another risk. It would be good for Congress to consider a new provision to this effect: 
regulations do not create countervailing risks that are greater than those of regulated risks. 
provisions of the enabling statute pursuant to which the agency is acting.โ 
A cost-benefit supermandate, properly interpreted, may well incorporate an understanding of this sort. But it would be best to make such a requirement explicit. 
Thus far I have offered some relatively modest suggestions. For the cost-benefit state, three more ambitious strategies would accomplish a great deal more. 
As Justice Breyer has suggested, a statute might well give the President some degree of the authority to divert public and private resources from small environmental problems to large ones, so as to ensure greater cost-effectiveness in government and better priority-setting.69 There are some dangers with this proposal; a small group of bureaucrats should not have the authority to decide on basic social priorities. But a greater degree of presidential priority-setting would make sense. 
Justice Breyerโs approach should be qualified by keeping in mind the fact that people are legitimately concerned with the various contextual factors discussed aboveโthe voluntariness of the risk, its potentially catastrophic character, whether it is especially dreaded, whether it is equitably distributed, and so forth. Ideas of this sort have received some modest attention in Congress; but the proposals have not been very ambitious. 
69 This is basically the approach suggested in S. Breyer, Breaking the Vicious Circle (1993). 
greater (but cheaper) reductions. 
Often the problem with federal regulation is that the government lacks knowledge of the least expensive means of producing the preferred regulatory end. If the private sector were permitted to select the means, it could do so far more cheaply. The point has been recognized in Europe and Japan, under the general rubric of โenvironmental contracting.โ7 0 In the Netherlands, for example, government has experimented with comprehensive, multi-media environmental targets for pollution reduction, accompanied by agreements from industry groups to achieve overall targets. In return for these agreements, government agrees to eliminate otherwise applicable pollutant-bypollutant regulations, and to reduce any changes in requirements during the length of the contract period. 
In the United States, the EPA has taken modest steps in the same direction. Thus the EPA has moved toward more cooperative solutions that use social pressures and moral suasion to encourage the use of innovative, low-cost pollution reduction techniques. The Green Lights Program, informing business about energy-efficient light fixtures, is an example, as is a recent program designed to encourage voluntary reductions in seventeen highly toxic chemical emissions.71 Consider also OSHAโs Star program, allowing companies with a demonstrably good safety record to rely on self-policing rather than government oversight. EPA is attempting to develop an Environmental Leadership program to parallel the Star program. 
So too, EPA and Amoco concluded that a plantwide approach would do better in decreasing chemical releases than does the existing command and control system; unfortunately, nothing happened, but the conclusion should affect regulatory reform efforts. Under the 1990 Clean Air Act, companies can, in essence, โcontract outโ of technology-based controls for five years 70 See Peter Mennell and Richard B. Stewart, Environmental Law and Policy 420-22 (1995). See Jan M. van Dunne, Environmental Contracts and Covenants (1993). 
71 See Wilkins and Hunt, Agency Discretion and Advances in Regulatory Theory, 63 George Washington L Rev 479, 492-98 (1995) if they achieve a 90% reduction in toxic pollutants before EPA promulgates relevant regulations.72 Under most federal statutes, however, EPA cannot approve private plans as substitutes for public mandates, even if the plans promise better results for less money. Congress should move in the direction of allowing private substitutes, so long as government monitoring is maintained. Of course it remains important to know whether the benefits from the private alternative are higher than the costs; perhaps the private alternative is cheaper but still not worthwhile on balance. What I am suggesting is that more creative, cooperative, and flexible programs, enlisting the informational advantages of the private sector, could be a large improvement over the status quo. 
We have seen throughout that command-and-control regulation can be highly dysfunctional. Sometimes relevant statutes forbid agencies from choosing incentive-based strategies even if agencies know that such strategies would work better. Congress might enact a particular provision to solve this problem. It might say, for example, โNotwithstanding any other provision of law, an agency shall be permitted to regulate with economic incentives, if it can show that these methods will produce the same benefits in a more cost-effective manner.โ73 Of course such a provision would involve risks. It could create further litigation, perhaps initiated by self-interested private groups seeking to stall desirable regulation. It could allow agencies unenthusiastic about regulatory mandates to proceed with less effective means of achieving compliance. But the problems with existing processesโ excessive costs, insufficient regulatory benefitsโare sufficient to make it worthwhile to move in this direction. 
The United States is embarking increasingly on the project of assessing government regulation by asking whether the benefits justify the costs. The regulatory state is slowly becoming 72 42 USC 112(h) 73 I borrow here from Statement of Jonathan Wiener, Before the Committee on Governmental Affairs, United States Senate, March 8, 1995. something like a cost-benefit state; this is an unmistakable feature of public life in many institutions of American government. Thus in the last decade and more, the executive branch has attempted to embrace a form of cost-benefit analysis for specific purposesโ to promote better priority-setting, to move toward market-oriented tools, to exempt de minimis risks, to attend to informed public judgments, to foster voluntary and least-cost compliance, and to focus on ultimate results rather than methods and processes. Similar steps can be found in Congress and the federal courts; but they remain tentative and incipient. 
In light of the chaotic and uncoordinated character of modern regulation, the absence of good priority-setting, and the system of โlegislation by anecdote,โ movement in the direction of a costbenefit state is in many ways a salutary development. As we have seen, balancing is far better than absolutism. The point is especially important in light of the fact that with respect to protection of human health, absolutism may actually be counterproductive and hence far from what it seems. Indeed, absolutism may impair rather than improve health. But costbenefit balancing can lead to excessive proceduralism, especially insofar as it is required via litigation. Moreover, the idea of costbenefit analysis needs a great deal of specification, and it is hardly sufficient to engraft a supermandate of โbalancingโ on top of a structure of command and control regulation. Any such mandate should be part of a general movement toward more flexible regulatory tools. 
I have suggested that a general background requirement of cost-benefit balancingโa substantive supermandateโshould be enacted. I have also suggested that in describing costs and benefits, Congress should allow room for a diverse array of values, and not limit agencies to the criterion of private willingness to pay. Sometimes regulation attempts to alter preferences and norms; sometimes it has little to do with aggregated willingness to pay. An Administrative Substance Act, amending the regulatory state, should include the background requirement I have described and also require agencies to act in a cost-effective fashion. A cost-benefit state, understood in these terms, could make large improvements by offering initiatives that make sense under any reasonable theory of value.
