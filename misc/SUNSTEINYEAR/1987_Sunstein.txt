Changing Conceptions of Administration* 
The New Deal was a period of self-conscious reflection about the original constitutional structure. To the New Deal reformers, the traditional framework could not deal adequately with modern problems. In particular, the system of checks and balances seemed to be an obstacle to necessary change. Although the most radical suggestions for structural reform1 were repudiated, the institutional learning of the New Deal manifested itself in a dramatic innovation: the modern regulatory agency, an entity that is largely independent of the constitutionally specified branches of government and that combines traditionally separated functions. 
The current structure of the national government is in a period of rethinking and transition, raising basic questions about the institutional framework of both the original Constitution and the New Deal period. This article outlines the changes introduced into the constitutional structure during the New Deal period, describes some of the developments in the fifty-year period since the New Deal, and makes some suggestions for future reform. The task for the future is to achieve some of the original constitutional goals in a period in which limited government is no longer an unambiguous good. An increasing role in the regulatory process for the constitutionally specified branches of government is necessary in order to accomplish this task.

THE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE The distribution of national powers, usually described in * This article is a revised version of a presentation given by Professor Sunstein at the Federalist Society Symposium entitled "Federalism and Constitutional Checks and Balances: A Safeguard of Minority and Individual Rights," held November 15-16, 1986, at the Law Center, Northwestern School of Law.

MACDONALD, A NEW CONSTITUTION FOR A NEW AMERICA (1921). terms of checks and balances or separation of powers, was of course a central feature of the original constitutional structure. The framers' basic strategy was to allow each branch a role in the workings of the other.' This strategy was highly distinctive and is currently controversial.3 It will be useful to begin by describing the basic purposes of the original system. 
The distribution of national powers serves two primary functions. Although these functions are in some tension with one another, they capture important strands in the theory underlying the Constitution. First, the distribution promotes efficiency in government. One of the central defects in the Articles of Confederation was the weakness of the national government, which lacked a distinct executive branch. The Constitution enabled government to act expeditiously while at the same time ob-' taining some of the advantages associated with a division of labor. The concentration of executive power in a single person eliminated the problems of indecision, delay, or stalemate often associated with a plural or deliberative body. In these respects, the original system should not be understood as producing a paralyzing "friction,"'4 but instead as facilitating government action. 
Second, the distribution of national powers created a series of checks and balances producing what Montesquieu described as a natural "state of repose or inaction." 5 The ability of one branch to counter another would make it less likely that government might act to oppress the citizenry. This basic view can be divided into several component concerns which, in concert, tend to account for the intuition that the system of checks and balances is a safeguard against tyranny-a structural arrangement serving the same purposes as a bill of rights. 
The first concern is a fear of factionalism: the risk that a well-organized private group might usurp governmental processes to redistribute wealth or opportunities in its favor. This fear played a prominent role in the framing of the Constitution and helped account for the desire to distribute powers into various branches over which no faction would likely have

control.' A well-organized group might obtain power over one branch, but it would be unlikely that it would do so over all three. 
The second concern is a fear that rulers might promote their own independent interests at the expense of the public as a whole. This might be called the problem of self-interested representation.7 This possibility was prominent in the minds of the framers8 and forms the central part of the argument of The Federalist No. 51.9 
The third concern is founded in a belief in limited government. The framers believed that protections against government action constituted an important safeguard of liberty and property. Thus Madison described protection of "the divers[e] . . . faculties of men" as the "first object of Government," and suggested that protection of inequality in wealth was a necessary corollary of this duty."0 The Constitution arose in part out of a concern that factionalism manifested itself in redistributive measures, including debtor relief laws, paper money, and efforts to equalize wealth." There can be little doubt that protection of rights of private property was an important constitutional concern.' 2 By making government action more difficult, the system of checks and balances tended to promote that goal. 
The fourth and final concern underlying the distribution of national powers is a belief in deliberation and stability. The system of checks and balances tends to make rapid changes difficult to accomplish. In this respect the distribution of powers was consonant with Madison's own hostility to rapid change in government, captured in his antipathy to "turbulence,"' 3 but disso6.

In the framers' system, these components were closely allied. Factionalism consisted largely of efforts to redistribute resources in ways that intruded on the goal of limited government. The FederalistNo. 10 reflects this idea by stating that "a rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, . . . [are an] improper or wicked object."' The fear of self-interested representation pointed to similar evils. Finally, turbulence and instability were, in the framers' view, identified with a system in which the distribution of wealth was put up for collective determination. The system of checks and balances was designed in large part to counter all of these risks, and to do so simultaneously. 
II. THE NEw DEAL 
The New Deal involved a radical departure from the original constitutional framework. New Deal reformers believed that the original structure was both substantively and institutionally inadequate to deal with the serious social problems arising from the depression. 
The substantive critique emphasized the inadequacies in a system of laissez-faire." That system, in the view of the New Deal reformers, was hardly natural or prepolitical, but instead amounted to a regulatory system. 17 For a wide variety of reasons, it was a failure as such. Some observers suggested that market ordering was inefficient and that governmental aid was necessary in the interest of national productivity. 8 Others stressed distributional goals. In this view, the problem with the laissez-faire system rests in the extremes of wealth and poverty that it created. 19 
Elsewhere, the New Deal reformers spoke the language of entitlement, and suggested that new sorts of rights must be vindicated. Thus President Roosevelt described a "second Bill of Rights" to include various forms of security. This new approach amounted to an attack on the original constitutional understanding of the rule of property in protecting "the divers[e] . . . faculties of men."20 According to the New Deal reformers, such diversity could not be protected without active government involvement. 
The substantive position of the New Deal led naturally to its institutional position, which amounted to a formidable challenge to tripartite government. The New Deal period saw a range of efforts to bring about radical structural change, usually in the form of a combination of traditionally separated functions or an expansion of the power of the President.21 The most radical suggestions were rejected, but some of their basic purposes were satisfied by the creation of modern regulatory agencies-the most enduring institutional legacy of the New Deal period.22 
The distinguishing marks of the modern regulatory agency are its independence from the three constitutionally specified branches, its combination of functions, its technical expertise, and its self-starting character. In the formulation of James Landis, the regulatory agency was to act like a business corporation, assisting the regulated industries and disciplining their excesses.23 A corporation could hardly be subject to the checks of tripartite government; such checks would be inconsistent with its mission. So too, the regulatory agencies were to be authorized to make, execute, and interpret the law. 
The modern agency is a natural outgrowth of the substantive position of the New Deal. If dramatic intervention by the national government is necessary, an institution unburdened by checks and balances seems highly desirable. In one sense the modern agency is consistent with the Madisonian scheme. During the New Deal period, as at the time of the Constitution's (January 11, 1944).

framing, a measure of insulation from the citizenry was thought desirable in the interest of avoiding factionalism. In both cases factionalism was viewed as the power of well-organized private groups over governmental processes. 4 
But there were important differences as well. During the New Deal period, a premium was placed on the need for technical expertise. This concern played little role in the original constitutional structure. The New Deal reformers, by contrast, had great faith in the ability of technocrats to discern a kind of unitary public interest. 5 Another, and more important difference, was that New Deal reformers saw the insulation of government officials as a means of disrupting the status quo rather than of protecting it from change. The importance of this point cannot be overstated. The institutional learning of the New Deal thus served dramatically different purposes from those of the framing period. For this reason the framers found the system of checks and balances congenial, whereas the New Deal reformers regarded it as an unnecessary and sometimes debilitating obstacle to reform. 
All this indicates that the New Deal period is rightly taken as a dramatic shift from the original constitutional structure, one that suggests that something akin to a constitutional amendment had taken place. 6 In the last quarter-century, however, the learning of the New Deal has itself been questioned. The belief in an autonomous administration has come under challenge from a number of directions, many of which invoke, usually quite inadvertently, some of the purposes that led to the original distribution of national powers. 
Some have argued that proliferation of agencies with overlapping functions makes coordinated or coherent policy impossible. For instance, more than a dozen agencies are responsible for national energy policy. According to proponents of this view, structural reform is necessary because of the multiplicity of agency functions and because, notwithstanding their technical American Law, 97 HARv. L. REv. 1276, 1318-27 (1984). 
1013, 1051-57 (1984). 
1402-09 (1975). expertise, agencies seem to reach widely varying results on the same issues.28 
Others have suggested that belief in the value of technocratic administration has been undermined by the presence of factionalism in regulation.29 In other words, regulatory agencies have shown themselves susceptible to the influence of well-organized private groups with important stakes in the outcome. The result is a perversion of the New Deal ideal, with regulation becoming a system of lawmaking by private groups. Sometimes this phenomenon produces over-regulation; at other times it results in under-regulation. There are numerous theories about the extent and cause of agency "capture." 30 But the existence of the problem has imposed pressure to bring about changes in the regulatory process. 
An additional complaint suggests that administrators obtain interests of their own, and that their decisions are designed to promote those interests.3 1 This idea is sometimes manifested in the view that administrators seek to expand their own budgets, power, and statutory authority. The result is a large distortion of the regulatory process. 
If these critiques are correct, the abandonment of the system of checks and balances-celebrated as a virtue by the New Deal reformers-has been a vice precisely in its introduction of some of the defects that led to the original constitutional scheme. The result has been a period of dissatisfaction with the institutional learning of the New Deal. This dissatisfaction need not be accompanied by a rejection of the New Deal's substantive attack on limited government. Although efforts to police the administrative process have frequently been accompanied by enthusiasm for deregulation, they have sometimes been based on precisely the opposite belief-that the institutional wisdom of the New Deal is inconsistent with its substantive mission. In these cases, quite surprisingly, attacks on agency autonomy have been brought about by those seeking to increase regulatory intervention in the marketplace. To understand the effects of the

(1971). New Deal on the current administrative structure, we must examine the recent institutional innovations in more detail. 
III. THE NEW DEAL AGENCY IN THE LAST QUARTER CENTURY 
The various incursions on the institutional learning of the New Deal have come from four directions. First, federal courts have assumed an increasingly aggressive role in supervising administrative decisions in an attempt to ensure "legality." Second, the executive branch has increased presidential control of the bureaucracy, ultimately by authorizing the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to assume considerable power over the regulatory process. Third, Congress has imposed a range of constraints on regulatory agencies, including detailed specifications of policy, procedural requirements, and judicially enforceable deadlines. Fourth, constitutional principles have been invoked as a barrier against independent administration. In concert, these developments amount to a broad rejection of administrative autonomy. 
During the last quarter-century, judicial review of administrative agencies has often been aggressive. Judicial control of regulatory behavior has come in the form of the "hard-look" doctrine, initially developed by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, 2 and subsequently endorsed by the Supreme Court.3 3 The hard-look doctrine has both procedural and substantive elements. Procedurally, it requires regulatory agencies to generate detailed explanations for their decisions, to consider reasonable alternatives, and to explain departures from past practices."' Substantively, the hardlook doctrine imposes a requirement that the agency's decision be reasonable on the merits. 5 Courts have frequently been quite intrusive in using these requirements to limit agency discretion. 6 
The hard-look doctrine has been used both in the service of, and as a constraint on, the substantive goals associated with the New Deal. For example, in some cases courts have invalidated agency action as insufficiently supported by the facts, thus enabling regulated industries to fend off government intervention."7 On occasion this has amounted to a judicially-imposed requirement of some sort of cost-benefit analysis.38 Cases of this sort are reminiscent of those following the New Deal, in which an aggressive judiciary, using principles of both constitutional law and statutory construction, limited regulatory intervention into the marketplace. This judicial hostility to regulation increased the impetus for administrative management. 
In other cases, courts have invalidated agency action or even inaction as insufficiently protective of regulatory beneficiaries. 9 Judicial scrutiny of deregulation has been a prominent example.40 In this latter set of cases, the institutional learning of the New Deal has been repudiated precisely in the achievement of its substantive goals. From the standpoint of the New Deal itself, this development is ironic; but in light of the frequent allegations of agency "capture" by regulated interests, it should not be surprising. The purpose of judicial review is to ensure that regulatory statutes are not defeated in the implementation process. In the 1970s and 1980s, plausible showings of abdication by regulatory agencies have resulted in a range of decisions invalidating inaction and deregulation.41 
In the present context, the distinctive feature of the hardlook doctrine has been the reinvigoration of the judicial role in the face of the institutional wisdom of the New Deal, which was hostile to the judiciary. That hostility resulted from many problems associated with judicial control. Those problems included costs, unwieldy procedures, delays,42 and the absence of THE COURTS: THE CASE OF THE CLEANAm AcT(1983).

and PrivateRights, 95 HARv. L. REV. 1193, 1197-98 (1982). 
coordination, centralization, expertise, or political accountability.43 
Many of the arguments made by New Deal critics of judicial intervention have been recalled in modern criticism of the judicial role, although the recent criticisms have often come from those hostile to regulation. Critics suggest that the hard-look doctrine will produce delay and meaningless boilerplate,"4 that courts lack the technical sophistication to undertake review, 5 and that judicial policy preferences, undisciplined by the electorate, will pollute the reviewing process. 46 Perhaps as a result of jsuudcihcicarlitmiciosdmess,tyt.h47ere have been prominent recent signs of more 
Full-scale retreat from the courts would be unfortunate. Experience has shown that the relevant risks are insufficient to justify abandonment of the hard-look doctrine. At least in its current form, the doctrine does not call for judicial displacement of policy choices except in extreme cases. The hard-look doctrine has operated instead as a safeguard against agency decisions that are inconsistent with statute or that are based on irrelevant or unarticulated factors. Above all, the hard-look doctrine has operated as a deterrent to careless or improperly motivated decisions.48 
The appropriate degree of judicial review is hard to resolve in the abstract. The judgment must be based on a set of understandings about the relevant pressures on courts and agencies. The case for the hard-look doctrine thus depends on a belief that the pressures imposed on agencies frequently distort the implementation process and that new mechanisms of control are necessary to limit such distortions. A substantial basis exists for this belief.49 In these circumstances, judicial independence has been largely a virtue: insulation from factional pressures has enabled courts to correct agency decisions. 
Moreover, it is important to ensure that regulatory beneficiaries are given the same type of legal protection accorded to regulated industries. A system of law that protects the latter but not the former tends to place skewed initiatives on administrators, who will be fearful of judicial intervention if they do too much, but will be immunized from control if they do too little. Such a set of incentives would likely produce outcomes inconsistent with the legislative intent in creating the administrative scheme in the first instance. An ironic fact of modern administrative law is that for most of the modern period, the rise of the regulatory state, representing a repudiation of common law ordering, has been accompanied by judicial doctrines owing their origin and shape to common law categories.5 0 Some of these understandings persist in legal doctrine suggesting that regulatory beneficiaries should be restricted to political remedies.5 1 A large task for the future is to bring the learning of the New Deal to bear on such doctrine. The result would be to entitle beneficiaries to the same protection accorded others.52 
Even if the hard-look doctrine is accepted, and even if regulatory beneficiaries are placed on the same terms as regulated industries, judicial review is hardly a complete solution to the problem of implementation failure. Judicial review is intermittent; it is ad hoc; and it operates after the fact. It should not be surprising that other sorts of controls have been sought by the President and Congress. 
In the New Deal model of administration, a large measure of agency independence was desirable. Insulation from direct presidential control fit comfortably with the basic belief in the salutary effects of expertise and immersion in a particular industry. The institutional result was the modern "independent" agency, insulated from presidential control. Since the time of President Roosevelt, however, the absence of presidential con50. See J. VINING, LEGAL IDENTITY: THE COMING OF AGE OF PUBLIC LAW 67-69 (1978); Sunstein, supra note 33, at 177-78, 213. 
750-66 (1984). 
REv. 653 (1985). trol of the bureaucracy has been a significant issue. The basic concerns are identical to those that fueled the original creation of a unitary rather than plural executive. These concerns fall into three categories. 
First, the President is able to centralize and coordinate regulatory policy in a way that would be impossible if agency officials were free to set policy on their own. The claim for presidential control is thus independent of any particular view on the value of regulation. It stems from the need, all the more insistent since the New Deal, to ensure a measure of coordination in policymaking. The President is uniquely situated to ensure such coordination. 
Second, the President is electorally accountable. His decisions have considerable visibility and attract a distinct kind of publicity. To be sure, agency heads are also subject to public scrutiny, and they are after all appointed by the President. But the President is subject to more in the way of continuous public supervision, and his institutional position tends to make him particularly concerned about public reaction. Moreover, the President is the only official in government charged with the administration of a "mass of legislation,""3 and his broader responsibilities may make a supervisory role especially valuable. 
Third, the President is able to energize and direct regulatory policy. This point is especially important in the beginning of a new term or when there is a consensus that national policy should be moved in a particular direction. The fact that agency heads are presidentially appointed may be helpful in this regard, but it is an imperfect check in light of the fact that agency heads may be subject to parochial pressures, including those imposed by well organized groups and by agency staffs. Some sort of presidential oversight may help to control these pressures. 
Understandings of this sort serve to explain the efforts of Presidents Nixon, Ford, Carter and Reagan to increase presidential control over agencies. Two recent Executive Orders issued by President Reagan dramatically illustrate the point. Executive Order 12,29154 authorizes OMB to review proposed rules for adherence to the basic principles of the President's regulatory program. Executive Order 12,49811 requires agencies to submit for dissenting). 
0MB consideration an "annual regulatory program" describing proposed courses of action for the coming year. 
These Orders accomplish both substantive and institutional goals. The substantive goal is to limit regulatory action, in part through the discipline of cost-benefit analysis. 6 Undoubtedly, one of the purposes of the reviewing process is to promote the operation of the free market.57 The institutional goal is to promote electoral accountability and coordination by ensuring that regulatory policy is overseen by people close to the President. The point to be emphasized is that issues of regulation present conflicts of value, or politics, not solely problems of technical expertise. To this extent, the New Deal model of autonomous administration has been repudiated by these developments. The substantive and institutional goals are, of course, distinguishable. In a different administration, one might expect the institutional goals to be endorsed even if the President's position on regulation is far more hospitable. 
The recent Executive Orders have been highly controversial, especially among those sympathetic to social regulation and fearful that OMB oversight will lead to a withdrawal of important regulatory safeguards. 58 Such fears have found some confirmation in practice. 59 The concerns about executive review extend to institutional matters as well. Critics have pointed to OMB's asserted lack of technical competence," its capacity to delay regulation, and its alleged susceptibility to the influence of well organized private groups.' 
It may be useful to understand the reviewing process as imposing on regulation a discipline akin to that used in developing the budget. The budgetary process followed a similar historical development, and it has largely been a success, at least compared with a system in which each agency submitted its budget separately to Congress. There are, to be sure, some limits to the budget analogy.2 A coordinating role by an institution close to the President, however, should improve the regulatory process, at least if the relevant institution is aware of the limitations of its role. 
Restrictions on OMB follow from the basic case for executive control. OMB review should set out the basic framework for decision and should not displace authority placed in the relevant agency. The problems created by the absence of OMB specialization in the particular area tend to be most severe in ad hoc interventions. OMB should also implement controls limiting the risk of factionalism by, for example, controlling ex parte contacts. Alternatively, the reviewing power might be removed from OMB and placed in another entity-one located within or close to the White House but perhaps less likely to have an anti-regulatory bias. In particular, it might be useful to ensure that the entity entrusted with review acts as an initiator of regulation, not merely as an obstacle. In some areas overregulation is a serious concern; in other areas underregulation, in the form of inadequate or unlawful failure to implement regulatory statutes, is the basic problem. No current institution is well-suited to deal with this problem. Both judicial and congressional control tend to be ad hoc and intermittent. 
Two points emerge from this discussion. First, the rise of presidential supervision is a significant inroad on the New Deal concept of administration, suggesting the importance of political accountability and political choice in the regulatory process. Second, a general oversight role is highly desirable, so long as the relevant officials are aware of the limitations of their role. There is no sufficient reason to prefer the ad hoc system that preceded the current period of organized presidential oversight. 
Under the New Deal model of administration, Congress' role was largely one of identifying a problem and asking the agency to deal with it. Some of the relevant statutes, for example, asked the agency to act in "the public interest" or to prohibit "unreasonable" practices6. This pattern has, however, changed over the last twenty years. Many modern regulatory statutes contain relatively clear guidelines for administrators to follow. For example, modern environmental statutes specify appropriate levels of pollution, set out deadlines, and allow courts to issue orders to bring about regulatory compliance.64 The notion that Congress generally contents itself with broad platitudes has become anachronistic. 15 
It is not difficult to identify the impetus behind measures of this sort. Congress has been concerned that regulatory statutes might be defeated in the implementation process and has attempted to limit that risk. In the environmental area the effort to be precise stems from a fear that an insufficiently motivated agency will fail to bring about full enforcement of the law. The experience under Executive Orders 12,291 and 12,498 suggests that statutory specificity has been important in bringing about regulatory initiatives.6 
This trend has its own risks as well. Congress may be inadequately informed; Congress is not immune to factionalism; and an agency's need for flexibility may argue in favor of a certain generality in delegations of power. Indeed, some have suggested that because of defects in the legislative process, it is desirable to delegate political decisions to bureaucrats. 7 Additionally, some forms of congressional control are impaired by a lack of legislative competence. In particular, efforts to identify statutory means, rather than statutory ends, may increase the power of well-organized groups or lead to irrationality6. 8 
Notwithstanding these risks, the general direction marked out by the recent statutes is desirable. The familiar truism that basic value judgments should be made by Congress has much to be said in its favor. A firmer congressional role promotes accountability; it also decreases the likelihood that statutes will be defeated in the implementation process. The exact amount of desirable agency discretion of course cannot be decided in the abstract: it will depend on the context. The New Deal model, however, reflected no such contextual inquiry; it reflected in64. See, e.g., The Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 7401-7642 (1982). statutory constraints). 
PoliticalDecisions, 1 J. LAW, ECON. & ORG. 81 (1985). 
stead a generalized belief in the ability of insulated administrators to make regulatory choices. The rise of a greater congressional role has been a healthy reaction to this belief. 
As the preceding discussion illustrates, all three institutions of government have shown renewed interest in supervising the bureaucracy. But do these various initiatives fit well together? In some cases the answer is easy. Judicial review and congressional specificity are natural allies. The primary function of the judiciary is to ensure conformity to law. If Congress has been precise, that task is far easier to perform. 
There is, moreover, no tension between presidential and congressional control, though the one may reduce the need for the other. The President must follow the constraints established in governing statutes. When those constraints are clear, presidential oversight is less necessary to achieve political accountability. But in light of the inevitable fact that value judgments must be made in the implementation process, some kind of broad supervisory role is likely to be helpful. 
The most obvious tension is between judicial and executive control. The hard-look doctrine emphasizes the role of technocratic reason and legality in the regulatory process. By contrast, presidential oversight is justified largely by a belief in the political character of regulation and the need to ensure that value judgments are made by those subject to political control. Indeed, the Executive Order process is a partial surrogate for judicial control because it provides oversight of and detailed justification for regulatory intervention. On what premises is it possible to approve of both judicial and executive oversight? 
The answer is found by examining the risks associated with both forms of control and the purposes of the original system of checks and balances. Even if the hard-look doctrine is accepted, it is at best an imperfect remedy for agency failure. Moreover, it introduces dangers of its own. In particular, judicial control is weakened by the lack of a general perspective on regulation and the absence of political accountability. Executive supervision is a salutary corrective. At the same time, recent executive orders have created a risk of having decisions made not only on the basis of statutorily irrelevant factors and illegitimate influences, but also with a general disregard for the appropriate claims of expertise and legality.69 In these circumstances, an aggressive judicial role is likely to be a salutary check. The two forms of control should therefore be regarded as complementary. 
It would be a mistake to overstate the effects of institutional suggestions of this sort, for administrative behavior is affected by other considerations as well, including the constellation of interests before the agency, the role of the media, public opinion, and the caliber and good-will of agency officials. More dramatic changes might be called for as well.70 Nevertheless, there is reason to believe that the complementary roles of the three branches, undertaking aggressive oversight of the regulatory process, will correct some of the defects in the New Deal conception of administration. 
E. 
Most of the modern regulatory agencies are not, in a technical sense, "independent." The status of "independence" is reserved for agencies whose heads are immune from plenary presidential power of removal. The governing statute ordinarily says that commissioners may not be removed except for inefficiency in office, neglect of duty, or related misconduct. The independent agencies include the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. In some respects, the independent agency is the model of the New 
the Supreme Court held that Congress has the constitutional authority to immunize some agencies from plenary presidential removal power.7 2 Dicta in the case suggest that such agencies may be immunized from any sort of presidential control.7 3 
In their basic functions, however, the independent agencies are hard to distinguish from executive agencies. Lawmaking, adjudication, and enforcement are undertaken by both types of agencies. Moreover, the notion that such agencies are "independent" is a gross oversimplification. Such agencies are subject to a

"except in [their] selection"). large measure of control from both the President and Congress.741 The difference is that the bar to presidential removal power tends to give commissioners some measure of insulation from day-to-day presidential supervision. The difference is one of degree, not of kind. 
Recent constitutional attacks on the independent agency stem from a "formalist" understanding of constitutional interpretation. In the formalist view, the text of the Constitution and the intent of its drafters furnish clear answers to at least some constitutional questions. Formalism has received some prominent endorsements in recent cases. 5 In the present context, the relevant provisions can be found in Article II, which vests the executive power in "a President of the United States '7' and requires the President to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. 7' 7 
These provisions, read against the background of the Framers' decision to create a unitary presidency, form clear foundations for a constitutional assault on independent administration. The basic argument is that the Constitution allows no room for a set of administrators operating autonomously of the President. The President is the constitutionally specified agent of Congress in the execution of federal law. The Constitution does not allow for an unaccountable and separate fourth branch of government entrusted with undertaking tasks analogous to those carried out by presidential aides.78 
This argument should be read in the context of mounting disaffection with New Deal administration. The underlying notion is that issues of policy, or judgments of value, are at stake, and they cannot be resolved solely by application of technical expertise-the same argument that has led to mounting oversight by the three constitutionally specified branches. In these circumstances it becomes all the more important to ensure that regulatory choices are made by officials subject to the control of a politically accountable actor. The President is the logical can74. See Strauss, The Place of Agencies in Government: Separation of Powers and the Fourth Branch, 84 CoLuM. L. REv. 573, 587-96 (1984).

didate. In this way, considerations of basic structure are brought to bear in the constitutional attack. 
The formalist objection to independent administration may overlook some complications in the original constitutional framework. It is uncertain whether the original framework disabled Congress from immunizing some administrators from plenary presidential control. 9 Moreover, the argument has the vices normally associated with formalist constitutional approaches. s0 The framers' decision to create a unitary executive does not resolve the question; the idea that it does so overlooks the dramatic changes in the character of the presidency in the period since the New Deal. 
In the original constitutional structure, the President's powers were sharply limited.81 The growth of a massive executive branch, entrusted with both the making and executing of the law, has made it difficult merely to "apply" the framers' initial judgment. A recognition that Congress might immunize some agencies from plenary presidential control could increase compliance with basic structural commitments insofar as it works against the aggrandizement of power in any single branch. In this sense, "independent" administration might be consistent with the central purposes of the system of checks and balances. Such authorization might also be a necessary quid pro quo for the downfall of the nondelegation doctrine, which has allowed a large rise in presidential power. 
These arguments raise difficult governing questions. Perhaps the best solution would be to interpret the governing statutes as granting the President some measure of control over the independent agencies. These statutes authorize the President to remove commissioners for specified grounds, including neglect of duty, inefficiency in office, and so forth. These terms might be construed as allowing some presidential exercise of supervisory power over the independent agencies. Such an interpretation would be consistent with the Supreme Court's interpretation of 18 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 285, 290-97 (1950). 
REV. 204 (1980). 
PERSONAL PRESIDENT 28- similar language in Bowsher v. Synar8 2 Moreover, such an interpretation would reform the basic structural commitment to electoral accountability and unitary execution of the laws. The interpretation would, however, recognize that Congress may structure the executive branch so as to impose some limitation on the degree of presidential oversight. Such a result would be consistent with the basic directions of practice and law in the period following the New Deal. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
The original constitutional structure was designed both to obtain the advantages associated with a division of labor and to create a series of checks on government action. In this latter respect, the original system usefully accommodated the efforts to limit government, to restrict the power of self-interested factions, to protect private property, and to reduce the risk that rulers might obtain and act upon interests adverse to those of the ruled. 
The New Deal period dramatically rejected both the institutional and the substantive learning of the original structure. The New Deal period saw the rise of a new concept of rights. The new conception was no longer tied to the common law and to private property; active governmental involvement in restructuring legal entitlements seemed necessary. It was natural for the New Deal reformers to see a need for a new entity, unburdened by tripartite government, to engage in the necessary tasks. The result was the modern regulatory agency. An important part of this understanding was that neutral technocrats would be wellsituated to design regulatory policy. 
Although aspects of the substantive learning of the New Deal remain largely intact, its institutional agenda has come under sharp attack in the last quarter-century. The notion that impartial expertise might solve regulatory problems has come to seem naive. Political choices are implicated in regulation. Such ideas help to account for the dramatic increase in judicial, presidential, and congressional oversight of the bureaucracy. These various forms of oversight have made it anachronistic to speak of an autonomous set of administrators. 
There is reason to believe the recent developments are steps GAO). in the right direction. To adopt a wholly political or wholly technocratic conception of administration would be a mistake. Both value choices and immersion in the facts ought to play significant roles. Sometimes a particular understanding of the subject will incline administrators with widely varying substantive positions in the same direction. Where value judgments are required, the central need is to ensure that they are made by politically accountable actors and opened up to public scrutiny and review. Redesign of the oversight roles of the constitutionally specified branches of government must be undertaken with such understandings in mind. 
The task for the future is to achieve some of the purposes of the original constitutional structure-in particular, to guard against factionalism and self-interested representation-in a period in which the goal of limited government can hardly be seen as an unambiguous good. That task is a formidable one. But the recent institutional innovations may help begin the larger task of constitutional reconstruction in the wake of the New Deal. 
congressionalprogramsfaithfully and effectively has called into question the wisdom of the central institutionalinnovations of the New Deal: the expansion of the regulatory state and the shift in power from the states to the federal government. In this Article, Professor Sunstein challenges the New Deal morefundamentally, examining not only the institutionalchanges themselves, but also the shift in constitutional commitments that underlay those reforms. Professor Sunstein identifies three aspects of New Deal constitutionalism: the rejection of the original constitutionalcommitment to checks and balances in favor of independent and insulated regulatory administration, the recognition of substantive entitlements beyond those protected at common law, and the abandonment of principles of federalism that vested regulatory authority in both thefederal government and the states. Professor Sunstein argues that many of the presentfailures of regulatory administration - particularlythe problems of agency capture and factionalism - can be traced to the New Deal's failure to incorporate the original constitutional commitment to checks and balances into regulatory administration. The remedy, he suggests, is to reinvigorate the commitment to checks and balances through a system of coordinated review of agency action that includes a strong supervisory role for each of the three branches of government - the executive, the judiciary, and Congress. In addition, Professor Sunstein maintains that the protection of new entitlements during the New Deal was a natural andjustified outgrowth of the recognition by New Deal reformers that the common law itself favors some social interests over others. He suggests that this substantive aspect of the New Deal should be incorporated into modern public law, in which common law categoriespersist despite the insights of New Deal reformers. Finally, Professor Sunstein argues that the third aspect of New Deal constitutionalism - the emphasis on national rather than local control of regulatory issues - has been carried too far, depriving citizens of the opportunity to participatemeaningfully in the debate over the terms of their social life.

Rodriguez provided valuable suggestions and research assistance. crease in presidential power, and the creation of a massive bureaucracy concentrated in the executive branch, have augmented factional power and self-interested representation, often leading to regulation that fails to serve the interests of the public at large. In significant ways, the federal government both overregulates and underregulates. The failure of national institutions to intervene or to exercise restraint is not simply the product of the poor judgment of key government officials or the triumph of a particular political agenda. Much of the failure of public regulation over the past half-century reflects the inadequacy of important aspects of the constitutional vision embraced by the New Deal. Institutional reform is thus a major part of the agenda of modern public law. 
The regulatory system established during the New Deal' has failed to fulfill its original promise. In the New Deal period, reformers believed that administrative officials would serve as independent, selfstarting, technically expert, and apolitical agents of change. This basic understanding wedded the original constitutional belief in the need for an energetic national government 2 to the desire, associated with the Progressive movement, 3 to insulate public officials from par' The initial period of growth for the regulatory agency came before the New Deal, during the latter part of the 19th century and the first two decades of this century. See generally S. SKOWRONEK, BUILDING A NEW AMERICAN STATE: THE EXPANSION OF NATIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITIES, I877-1920 (z982) (surveying the early development of the modern administrative state). It is important to emphasize as well that the New Deal was far from monolithic. There were competing strands and several different periods of experimentation, with different emphases. For all its novelty, the New Deal was not an altogether sudden break; it should instead be understood as the culmination of a set of ideas with much earlier foundations. See generally id.; W. WILSON, CONGRESSIONAL GOVERNMENT: A STUDY IN AMERICAN POLITICS 22-23 (I98i) [hereinafter W. WILSON, CONGRESSIONAL GOVERNMENT] (describing "the new leadership of the Executive"); W. WILSON, CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT IN THE UNITED STATES 57-81 (1921) [hereinafter W. WILSON, CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT]; id. at 6o (chronicling the rise of the President "as the unifying force in our complex system, the leader both of his party and of the nation"); W. WILSON, THE NEW FREEDOM: A CALL FOR THE EMANCIPATION OF THE GENEROUS ENERGIES OF THE PEOPLE 5-8 (196i) (detailing Wilson's campaign to regulate the trusts). The discussion in this Article is therefore stylized, emphasizing dominant features. For discussion of the period, see generally P. CONKIN, THE NEW DEAL (2d ed. 1975); K. DAVIS, FDR: THE NEW DEAL YEARS, 1933-1937 (1986); 0. GRAHAM, JR., TOWARD A PLANNED SOCIETY (1976); E. HAWLEY, THE NEW DEAL AND THE PROBLEM OF MONOPOLY (1966); R.

The concept of autonomous administration, now under sharp attack, was originally the source of enormous optimism about possible reformation of the system of checks and balances. The New Dealers believed that institutional changes were necessary to allow the federal government to deal with the multiple social and economic issues that arose in the wake of the Depression. 
The institutional program of the New Deal was one element of a three-part critique of the traditional constitutional framework. The first criticism, substantive in character, was the culmination of a long period of rethinking both of that framework and of the system of common law ordering. For the New Deal reformers, the common law was neither natural nor prepolitical. Instead, it embodied a particular social theory, serving some interests at the expense of others. 4 In particular, the New Dealers viewed the common law as a mechanism for insulating the existing distribution of wealth and entitlements from collective control. The common law catalog of rights included both too much and too little - excessive protection of established property interests and insufficient protection of the interests of the poor, the elderly, and the unemployed. Hence the New Deal reformers called for substantial changes that would recognize new interests as entitlements and redistribute resources.5 Most dramatically, President Franklin Roosevelt urged a "second Bill of Rights," available to all "regardless of station, race, or creed," and including: 
shops or farms or mines of the Nation; 
The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation; 
The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living; 
The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad; 
The right of every family to a decent home; 
The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health; 
The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment; 
The right to a good education. 6 4 See infra pp. 437-38. 1 See infra pp. 437-40.

The second element of the New Deal critique focused on the institutional system of tripartite government and checks and balances. The New Deal reformers believed that the original constitutional structure, like the common law, was closely associated with protection of the existing distribution of wealth and entitlements. In their view, the system of separated functions prevented the government from reacting flexibly and rapidly to stabilize the economy and to protect the disadvantaged from fluctuations in the unmanaged market. 7 In addition, the New Deal reformers believed that the distribution of powers among the three branches of government created political struggles that disabled officials in the executive branch from making regulatory policies free of partisan pressure. 
Although the most radical attacks on tripartite government failed, some of the impulses behind those attacks paved the way for both enhanced presidential authority and the rise of regulatory administration. 8 The newly created agencies, largely a creature of the New Deal, 9 combined traditionally separated functions and remained free of direct control from Congress, the federal judiciary, and sometimes origin of the term "New Deal" in this way: 
The word "Deal" implied that the government itself was going to use affirmative action to bring about its avowed objectives rather than stand by and hope that general economic laws alone would attain them. The word "New" implied that a new order of things designed to benefit the great mass of our farmers, workers and business men would replace the old order of special privilege in a Nation which was completely and thoroughly disgusted with the existing dispensation.

REV. 95 (1928) (discussing the function and place of the independent commission within government). 8 See infra pp. 440-41. 
9 Although administrative agencies have been a part of government since the founding of the republic, the modern regulatory agency is a recent phenomenon. The Interstate Commerce Commission was created in 1887, and the Federal Trade Commission in 1914, but it was not until the New Deal that the modern agency became a pervasive feature of American government. Eleven agencies were created between the framing of the Constitution and the close of the Civil War; six were created from i865 to the turn of the century; nine agencies date from 19oo to the end of World War I; nine more were created between 1918 and the Depression in 1929; and no fewer than 17 were created in the decade between 193o and 1940. See ATTORNEY GENERAL'S COMMITTEE ON ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE, FINAL REPORT 7-I1 (1941) [hereinafter ATTORNEY GENERAL'S COMMITTEE]. These New Deal agencies included the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Social Security Board, the National Labor Relations Board, the Commodity Exchange Commission, the Railroad Retirement Board, the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor, and the Selective Service Administration. See id. at io-ii. In addition, of course, new duties were conferred on established entities during this period. even the President.' 0 The institutional critique of the period, pointing to the need for entities not burdened by tripartite government, naturally accompanied the New Deal's substantive program." 
The third element in the New Deal critique, also institutional, produced a massive shift in the relationship between the federal government and the states. Interdependencies in the economy, a central revelation of the Depression, made it increasingly difficult for reformers to believe that states could solve social and economic problems on their own. Competition among the states sometimes produced paralysis; many problems called for a uniform national remedy. States often seemed to be arenas for factional strife and parochialism. 12 Moreover, the size of state government and the dominance of wellorganized private groups within the states made it difficult to credit the traditional belief that local self-determination could genuinely be achieved by state autonomy. In these circumstances, the call for a dramatic increase in the exercise of federal regulatory power seemed quite natural. 
In the New Deal period, the original constitutional framework was thus reformulated in three fundamental ways. The New Deal set out a different conception of legal rights, rejecting common law and status quo baselines for deciding what constituted governmental "action" and "inaction"; it proposed a dramatically different conception of the presidency and a novel set of administrative actors; and it rejected traditional notions of federalism. The term "New Deal constitutionalism" describes the resulting structure. 
Although the reformers of the 1930's were largely successful in changing both legal entitlements and institutional forms, American nublic law has not entirely come to terms with New Deal constitutionalism, and many current controversies reflect ambivalence about its legacy. Some of modern public law, for example, is built directly on common law or status quo baselines. For example, rights to a hearing, 13 to an article III tribunal, 14 and to judicial review of agency action' 5 -are powerfully influenced by common law categories; the 10 See infra pp. 444-45. The degree to which agencies were intended to be or have in fact been immune from presidential control is subject to dispute. See id.; infra note 352. 
It See J. LANDIS, supra note 7, at 30-40 (describing institutional limits on the ability of courts to regulate economic activity); Hale, Coercion and Distribution in a Supposedly Noncoercive State, 38 POL. SCI. Q. 470, 478-81 (1923) (discussing coercion in markets). 12 See infra note 391 and accompanying text. 13 See infra pp. 502-03. 14 See Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipeline Co., 458 U.S. 5o (1982). 1s See infra pp. 474-78 (discussing standing and reviewability). existence of a right protected at common law is highly relevant in all three areas. One of the greatest ironies of modern administrative law - an area whose origins lay in a substantial repudiation of the common law - is its continuing reliance on common law categories. 
The institutional issues are in a similar state of flux. Over the last three decades, autonomous administration has come under pressure from a variety of directions. In a number of statutes enacted since I96O, Congress has attempted to limit administrative discretion through timetables, deadlines, and clear instructions about implementation. In the i96O's and 1970's, the courts became increasingly aggressive in reviewing administrative activity. Since 1970, the President has sought to impose greater control. There has also been a resurgence of doubt about the constitutional status of agencies that are "independent" of presidential control. In all of these areas, traditional checks and balances have been reinvigorated in an effort to police the administrative process and to restore electoral accountability. Current failures of regulatory agencies have thus undermined the institutional learning of the New Deal during a period in which the New Deal skepticism about "limited government" remains for the most part intact, at least in the context of social regulation. 16 
Recent efforts to impose judicial and executive checks on the regulatory process have been especially controversial. In light of the ideological tension between the President and the judiciary during the Reagan Administration, it should perhaps be unsurprising that those who favor an active judicial role tend to oppose the exercise of presidential authority 17 and that those favorably disposed toward presi16 President Reagan, for example, has not fundamentally altered the regulatory state. During his first term, he spoke approvingly of the "social safety net," and his intrusions on spending and regulatory measures were not intended to eliminate minimum floors. See generally MAINTAINING THE SAFETY NET: INCOME REDISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS IN THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION (J. Weicher ed. 1984) (examining changes in income security and redistribution programs during Reagan's first term).

Rv. 879, 897-902 (1982) [hereinafter Morrison, PresidentialIntervention in Informal Rulemaking]. Courts have invalidated a number of deregulatory efforts. See, e.g., Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983) (invalidating an agency's rescission of passive restraint regulation); Action for Children's Television v. FCC, 821 F.2d 741, 745-77 (D.C.

REV. 177, dential authority are skeptical about the supervisory role of the federal courts. 18 But the disagreement between advocates of presidential control and advocates of judicial power is undergirded not only by divergent views about how much social and economic regulation is desirable, but also by disagreement over the respective roles of politics, law, and technical expertise in the regulatory process. 19 The advocates of a strong judicial role generally embrace a technocratic conception of regulation - also associated with the New Deal - in which immersion in the law and facts leads to uniquely correct solutions, or at least to a sharply restricted range of acceptable outcomes. 20 In a curious reversal of the New Deal understanding that technocratic rationality precludes judicial control, some observers maintain that the courts should play an important role in regulation - to ensure "legality" and to prevent factionalism - and that the role of the President is secondary. 2 1 
The advocates of presidential control are deeply skeptical of this conclusion. For them, regulatory issues are above all "political." Here, as elsewhere, the precise meaning of the term "political" is not always clear, but the central ideas are that regulation poses issues of values and not of facts, and that the relevant values should be implemented by those accountable to the public. In addition, presidential control is said to promote technocratic rationality. 2 2 It follows igo-gi. Courts have also reviewed administrative inaction and sometimes compelled administrative action. See, e.g., Doyle v. Brock, 821 F.2d 778, 783-87 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (invalidating a decision by the Secretary of Labor not to challenge a union election procedure); NAACP v. Secretary of Hous. & Urban Dev., 817 F.2d 149, 157-61 (ist Cir. 1987) (requiring HUD affirmatively to further the antidiscriminatory policies of the Fair Housing Act); Public Citizen Health Research Group v.

22See infra pp. 453-56. that the President should play a critical role in regulation, and that the courts should do very little. 
Controversies over clear congressional instructions to agencies often turn on similar disputes about the relationship between the political and technocratic features of regulation. Advocates of congressional specificity point to the risk of regulatory failure and the advantages of the legislative process in terms of visibility and accountability. 23 Critics contend that Congress is itself beset by factionalism 24 and that a measure of agency autonomy is necessary to ensure flexibility and specialization in the matter at hand. In all of these areas, the debate over the regulatory process has refocused attention on the nature of tripartite government in an era of positive regulation. 
Finally, efforts have been made to achieve some of the goals associated with the original federal structure. Proposals for increasing state autonomy, promoting local self-determination, and achieving economic democracy recall the roots of the Constitution in principles of civic republicanism. 25 At least for some, the goals of such proposals are to find a realm for active citizen participation in deciding the terms of social life, to promote flexibility and diversity, and to ensure that political outcomes result from civic virtue and deliberation rather than from self-interest and bargaining. 
The principal purpose of this Article is to describe the relationship between the original constitutional structure and the New Deal reformation and to outline some of the lessons of the last half-century for dilemmas in modern public law. The Article suggests that the New Deal's substantive critique was largely correct; indeed, in some ways it did not go far enough. 26 An important task for the future is therefore to generate a new set of entitlements to accompany the development of public law. On the other hand, the institutional framework of the New Deal was largely a mistake - an unnecessary and in some ways counterproductive means of achieving its own substantive program. Even if the institutional goal of insulating officials from constituents is grounded in established features of Amer23 See, e.g., T. LowI, THE END OF LIBERALISM: THE SECOND REPUBLIC OF THE UNITED STATES 298-301 (2d ed. 1979).

25 See Stewart, Federalism and Rights, i9 GA. L. REv. 917, 918 (x985) ("[D]ecentralized self-government promotes republican values by providing citizens greater opportunities to participate in public and political life and collectively to deliberate and define the character of their community."). See generally B. BARBER, STRONG DEMOCRACY (984) (advocating decentralization in the interest of participatory democracy). 
26 In the area of economic regulation, however, and in economic premises generally, New Deal understandings were misguided, resulting in regulatory schemes based on faulty assumptions. See generally S. BREYER, REGULATION AND ITS REFORM (1982) (discussing regulatory failures that often result from "mismatching" the diagnosis of the market problems and the administrative remedy applied). ican constitutionalism,2 7 this goal has not been served by the institutional innovations of the New Deal. Administrative agencies have failed to serve as vehicles for democratic aspirations, and the regulatory regimes they have designed have often been unsuccessful. 
In these circumstances, it is necessary both to counter the pathologies of the current institutions and to consider new initiatives. Such strategies must of course recognize the need for regulatory agencies that can provide both flexibility over time and specialization in the subject at hand. But in the wake of the abandonment of the New Deal vision of independent administration, the best alternative is to develop a system of aggressive legislative, judicial, and executive control - a system in which the three institutions bring about something close to the safeguards of the original constitutional framework without retreating to anachronistic understandings of "limited government." Such a system, accompanied by a reformulated network of rights and strengthened federalism, will promote those aspects of New Deal constitutionalism that have the strongest claim to contemporary support. 
I propose a number of reforms to accomplish these goals. These include (i) increased presidential supervision of the executive agencies, accompanied by various safeguards; (2) reformulation of executive control to include the power and responsibility to encourage the undertaking of regulatory initiatives - to some degree on the ombudsman model28 - as well as the authority to discourage unnecessary or counterproductive proposals; (3) continuation of a moderately aggressive role for the federal judiciary; (4) development of a greater role for Congress in agency administration, through specifications of regulatory ends, deadlines, and various sorts of oversight; (5) reduction of statutes that identify the means by which agencies are to accomplish statutory goals; (6) inclusion of independent agencies within the supervisory authority of the President; (7) revision of the system of rights to extend the New Deal abandonment of common law and status quo baselines; (8) reformulation of administrative law doctrines to place regulatory beneficiaries on the same plane as regulated entities; and (9) a departure from the national focus of the New Deal to a system that increases opportunities for local self-determination and democratic participation. 
This Article is organized as follows. Part II describes the relationship between limited government and the traditional distribution of national powers; it also explores the ways in which New Deal constitutionalism departed from the original framework, both in its institutional critique and in its opposition to limited government. Part III 27 See infra pp. 431-32. 28 See infra pp. 488-89. describes and evaluates changing attitudes of the President, the courts, and Congress toward the administrative process, suggesting that because of the various intrusions on agency autonomy, traditional conceptions of administration have become anachronistic. Part III also addresses the relationships among the various forms of control and discusses the constitutional attack on independent agencies, relating that attack to the declining faith in New Deal administration. Part I argues in favor of a revised system of checks and balances, adapted for a period of active governmental regulation of the economy. Part IV discusses the reformulation of rights during the New Deal period, substantive regulatory reform, and the question of local self-determination. 
The New Deal was a self-conscious revision of the original constitutional arrangement of checks and balances, and some of the problems of modern regulation are a product of the myopic reaction of the New Deal reformers to the system of separated and divided powers. New Deal constitutionalism must therefore be understood against the backdrop of the traditional framework. It is necessary at the outset to note that the notion of separation of powers is in important respects a mis characterization of the constitutional system, which should instead be understood in terms of checks and balances. 2 9 The three branches of course have overlapping functions; each is involved to some degree in the activities of the other.30 The term "separation" tends to disguise this fact. 
The distribution of national powers was powerfully influenced by the Madisonian revision of classical republican thought and in particular by the Madisoiian conception of representation. 3 1 In Madison's framework, the central danger for a political system lay in factionalism - the usurpation of governmental power by well-organized private 29 See F. McDONALD, Novus ORDO SECLORUM 258 (1985) ("The doctrine of the separation of powers had clearly been abandoned in the framing of the Constitution; as Madison explained in Federalist numbers 47-51, mixing powers was necessary to ensure a system of checks and balances."). 
30 Examples of overlapping control include the President's role in lawmaking, most prominently the presentment clause; the power of Congress to advise and consent to presidential appointments; the power of Congress to vest the appointment authority in the President alone, department heads, or courts; judicial review; and the mixed roles of Congress and the President in the area of foreign affairs. 
31 See D. EPSTEIN, THE POLITICAL THEORY OF THE FEDERALIST 93-99 (1984) (discussing Madison's view of the duty of representatives to promote the public good). groups with interests adverse to those of the public as a whole. 32 Madison believed that politics should not consist of a series of unprincipled trade-offs among self-interested factions. The process should instead have a significant component of deliberation and dialogue about the public good. As Madison saw it, however, experience had shown that the classical republican belief in small-scale democracy, calling for active citizen participation 33 in government, was unrealistic and counterproductive. 3 4 In view of the self-interested character of citizen behavior, efforts to promote decisions by the citizenry at large would produce factional warfare. 35 Widespread citizen participation therefore would not serve the traditional republican belief in deliberative government. 
Madison's solution dramatically revised traditional republican thought.3 6 For classical republicans, only a small republic with direct self-rule could produce and benefit from a virtuous citizenry.3 7 Madison turned this understanding on its head. In his view, it was a large republic, with comparatively insulated representatives, that would be uniquely able to produce a well-functioning deliberative democracy. A small republic would be torn by factional warfare; in a large one, by contrast, representatives would be able to escape the pressures of powerful groups and engage in the deliberative tasks of politics. It was therefore necessary to place decisions in the hands of representatives chosen from a large territory, "whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations. '38 In this respect, there is a Burkean strand in Madison's theory of representation. 3 9 Madison abandoned the classical republican belief in direct self-rule by the citizenry 40 without rejecting the underlying republican faith in deliberative democracy. Of course, the framers set out other safeguards as well, including federalism and a measure of political accountability, achieved through direct election of the House of Representatives and through electoral control of other institutions. 
The distribution of national powers served two principal purposes. 4 1 The first was efficiency, brought about by a sensible division of labor. Often the separation of powers is thought to confine authority, but in some respects it increases and liberates it. For example, a central defect of the Articles of Confederation was its failure to provide for a strong executive. The framers, responding to this failure, created an executive branch designed to promote energetic and consistent governance. 4 2 
The goal of governmental efficiency was also promoted by the coordination of executive action, which was to be achieved through the creation of a unitary executive branch. 43 The framers rejected a "plural executive" on the ground that the fragmentation of power would make expeditious action impossible, attenuate accountability, and prevent coordination and centralization of policy. 44 Hence executive power was vested in the President alone.4 5 The division of power between the executive and the judiciary also served to free the executive from responsibility for decisions that all or parts of the citizenry might disapprove. By conferring adjudicative functions on a separate institution, the framers ensured that the executive would not be held responsible for decisions unfavorable to particular factions. 4 6 
Even though the distribution of national powers can be understood as an efficient division of labor, the best-known justification for the distribution is the need to diminish the risk of tyranny. Even as Madison extolled the value of a large republic in promoting publicspirited representation, he recognized that "enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm." 47 The distribution of national powers was designed to check unenlightened or self-interested representatives. Above all, it diffused governmental power, reducing the likelihood that any branch would be able to use its power against all or parts of the citizenry. The system of checks and balances allowed each branch - armed with its own ambitions - to attempt to counter the other. 48 In these respects, checks and balances fit comfortably into a system in which dangers were thought to lie principally in governmental action rather than failure to act. 
In view of this history, it should not be surprising that the New Deal reformers associated the system of checks and balances with governmental inaction. This association prompted advocates of governmental intervention to seek a substantial reformation of the original distribution of national powers. The reformation has been only partly successful, however, and many of its failings recall the purposes underlying the original system of checks and balances. It is therefore 45 See Flaumenhaft, supra note 42, at 70-71, 74; id. at 70 (arguing that in the Hamiltonian system of energetic national government, "[o]nly replacing the vestiges of democratic participation by an efficacious administrative system could supply the energy to protect [Americans] against turmoil and invasion and the energy to manage their prosperity," and stating that "[t]he rejection of classical politics culminates in the politics of administration"). This understanding fits comfortably with Madison's theory of representation; it also presages the New Deal. See 'infra pp. 441-42.

47 THE: FEDERALIST No. io, at 58 (J. Madison) (C. Van Doren ed. 1945). 
48 This justification appears in THE FEDERALIST No. 47 (J. Madison) (C. Van Doren ed. 1945): "The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed,. or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny." Id. at 322. This basic theme can also be found in Justice Brandeis' celebrated suggestion that the "doctrine of the separation of powers was adopted by the Convention of 1787, not to promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power. The purpose was, not to avoid friction, but, by means of the inevitable friction incident to the distribution of the governmental powers among three departments, to save the people from autocracy." Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 293 (1926) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). necessary to explore the ways in which the distribution of national 1owers operates as a safeguard against tyranny. The framers emphasized several considerations; most are highly relevant to current institutional dilemmas. 
r. The Rule of Law. - The distinction between the legislature and the executive ensures that the power to execute the law is not in the hands of those who make it. Because legislators are unable to exempt themselves from law execution, they must, in enacting laws, take the perspective of ordinary citizens subject to the force of the law. Thus "[i]f a separate executive will enforce the law even against the lawmakers, the lawmakers will not have a 'distinct interest from the rest of the Community." 49 In this way, the distribution of national powers promotes generality in lawmaking - a fundamental constitutional value. 
stresses the desire to ensure that government officials will not act in their own interests, but in the interest of the public as a whole. The concern that rulers might have independent interests, and use them to oppress the public, played an important role in the framing of the Constitution.50 The term "self-interested representation" describes the phenomenon of representatives seeking to promote their own interests. 5' If authority were concentrated in one branch, that branch would be more likely and able to increase its own power at the expense of the governed. By allowing each branch to check the others, the distribution of national powers was intended to act as a partial solution to this problem, increasing democratic control over representatives and safeguarding both liberty and private property against governmental action. 52 
constitutional distribution of powers stresses the goal of limited government. The executive and judiciary must concur with the legislature in order for a law to be enforced. No law can be brought to bear against the citizenry without a broad consensus. Each branch has the power to prevent legal impositions. This system tends to make it difficult for government to act unless there is something close to general agreement that it ought to do so. This rationale echoes Montesquieu's observation that a system with three branches "should naturally form a state of repose or inaction."5 3 
49 D. EPSTEIN, supra note 31, at 130 (quoting J. LOCKE, Two TREATISES OF GOVERNMENT 410 (P. Laslett ed. 1965) (3d ed. 169S)). In this respect, the system of checks and balances has an implicit but powerful equal protection theme. 
so See THE FEDERALIST No. 5X (J. Madison). 
51 The economic term is "agency costs." See Jensen & Meckling, Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior,Agency Costs, and Ownership Structure, 3 J. FIN. ECON. 305 (1976). 52 See Levi, Some Aspects of Separationof Powers, 76 COLuM. L. REV. 371, 374 (1976). 53 C. MONTESQuIEu, THE SPIRIT OF THE LAWS 211 (D. Carrithers ed. 1977) (T. Nugent trans. 2d ed. 1748). 
For the framers, the legislature posed the primary threat of unjustified intrusion into the private sphere. The period immediately before the Constitutional Convention of i787 was characterized, in the view of many of the framers, by dangerous interventions by the legislature into the realm of liberty and private property.5 4 The distribution of national powers was therefore intended to ensure the protection of individual rights - most prominently rights of property - against the legislature.5 5 
There is in this respect an intimate connection between the distribution of national powers, the protection of private ordering, and the framers' emphasis on the need for "deliberation" before governmental action.5 6 Deliberation was designed in part as a check against popular passions for redistribution of wealth. 
national level also helped resolve a central problem of government: factionalism, which poses the risk that private groups might usurp public power in order to redistribute wealth or opportunities in their favor.5 7 Such private groups, whether minorities or (more likely) majorities, might use governmental authority to oppress others. The separation of powers and the system of checks and balances were intended to reduce that risk. A faction might come to dominate one branch, but it was unlikely to acquire power over all three. The distribution of national powers thus operated to protect minorities from the tyranny of powerful private groups. It is important to emphasize that the framers' concerns about factionalism, self-interested representation, and limited government were closely linked, and indeed ultimately merged in the general effort to use constitutionalism to limit the thrust of democracy.5 8 limit government; it also promotes stability by insulating the status quo from rapid change. In many cases, two or more branches must concur in order to alter current law; the system is structured to provide each branch with the means and the will to resist the others. The desire to promote stability was closely related to the framers' belief in private property and economic development in a commercial republic. 
Significantly, the system of checks and balances ensured that the terms of regulation often would be set by the common law courts, which had a vital place in the system. The importance of this point cannot be overstated. 5 9 Courts creating and implementing the common law could play a major role in social ordering, promoting private markets and resisting the various dangers associated with a government that combined the power to make, interpret, and execute the law. A politically insulated judiciary was permitted to assume this function because the common law was supposed to embody a system of natural or prepolitical rights; 60 in acting according to the dictates of "reason," courts were not subject to the risks posed by a combination of powers in the legislative or executive branch of the national government. As we will see, all of these understandings came under sharp attack during the New Deal period. 
At the same time, the federal nature of the system generated another series of constraints on government, 6 1 promoted flexibility, accountability, and diversity, and permitted a measure of self-determination through classically republican participation in government. The result was a complex system. Madisonian representation at the national level would allow for deliberation in government; the creation of a unitary executive and the division of labor would permit national action to meet national needs; the distribution of national powers would furnish checks diminishing the risks associated with factionalism, self-interested representation, and incursions into private property accord F. McDONALD, supra note 29, at 176-83 (discussing the view that the period before the framing was characterized by excessive democracy); I THE FOUNDERS' CONSTITUTION, supra note 44, at 544 (quoting a reference by Rep. Gerry to "the excess of democracy"). But see Diamond, supra note 36, at 68-72 (suggesting the democratic character of the original safeguards). 
59 See generally S. SKOWRONEK, supra note i, at 39-46, 285-92 (stressing that the original system was a "state of courts and parties"). 
60 See F. McDONALD, supra note 29, at 1-4o, 111-14 (tracing the relevance of common law to the framers' system). A recent commentator has illustrated this view in a manner characteristic of the nineteenth century. See R. EPSTEIN, TAKINGS: PRIVATE PROPERTY AND THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN (1985); Epstein, A Theory of Strict Liability, 2 J. LEGAL STUD. 151 (1973). The framers' understanding of the common law differed from the nineteenthcentury formulation; McDonald's historical account of the relevance of property and the common law is thus substantially different from that offered by Epstein. 
61 See THE FEDERALIST No. 51 (J. Madison) (describing the federal system as a method of distributing power and therefore a means of protecting against abuse). and liberty; and the federal system would create supplemental safeguards and allow a measure of citizen self-determination as well. 
i. Substantive and institutionalreform. - The modern regulatory agency emerged largely from deep dissatisfaction with both the common law system of private ordering and the original distribution of national powers. 62 The Progressives criticized the common law on a number of grounds. 6 3 A prominent part of their critique focused on the antidemocratic character of judicial lawmaking - a problem particularly severe in the constitutional context, but also troubling with regard to the common law. The problem was posed most sharply during the Lochner era, 64 when constitutional constraints owed their origin and shape to common law categories. 
An additional concern was the anachronistic, or at least incomplete, character of common law rights. The Depression and the failures of unregulated businesses made it harder to argue that governmental intervention beyond common law rules65 was antithetical to economic productivity. The collapse of the common law market system during the Depression made the utopian premises of laissez-faire thought seem fanciful. Indeed, economic recovery seemed to call for greater coordination and planning. A final concern was the perceived need for redistribution of wealth and entitlements, 66 which could not be brought about through the common law. Most fundamentally, many New Deal reformers regarded the common law itself as a regulatory scheme, not as prepolitical, and asserted that the common law had proved wholly inadequate in this regulatory role. 6 7 The very term "New Deal" is highly suggestive. It connotes a reshuffling of the cards, from which a different distribution of benefits and burdens would result. 
Reformers in the New Deal period thus called for the recognition of a new category of legal rights. Traditional rights of market ordering no longer captured the category of fundamental interests; they were both over- and under-inclusive. Rights to governmental assistance in the employment market, for example, were insufficiently protected by the common law, as were the interests of the poor, consumers of dangerous food and drugs, the elderly, traders on securities markets, and victims of unfair trade practices. At the same time, the common law system gave undue protection to rights of private property. In some settings the common law itself seemed a product of factional power in its protection of some interests and its unwillingness to recognize others. 68 
This basic theme, a central ingredient of New Deal constitutionalism, was prominent throughout Roosevelt's presidency. In his speech accepting the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 1936, for example, Roosevelt argued that although the constitutional framers were concerned only with political rights, new circumstances required the recognition of economic rights as well, because "freedom is no half-and-half affair."6 9 The most dramatic statement of this revised notion of entitlement came in President Roosevelt's State of the Union address of I944, which set forth the "Second Bill of Rights" quoted above. 70 These rights were to apply to all citizens, "regardless of station, race, or creed."'7 1 The substantive program of the New Deal thus constituted a rejection of the common law system in favor of a new conception of rights, albeit of uncertain dimensions. 7 2 The 1987] program dramatically altered the baselines from which governmental action or inaction and partisanship or neutrality would be measured. Although the new conception of rights revised the original understandings, it maintained a measure of continuity. President Roosevelt placed the new spirit of entitlement squarely within the framework of rights; his nomenclature both recalled the original Bill of Rights and added to it. 
The case for departure from common law ordering took various forms. Sometimes New Deal reformers emphasized the need for centralized planning under the authority of the national government. 73 On occasion they stressed the benefits of cartelization in promoting economic productivity. 74 There is, in this regard, a close connection between public interest justifications for regulation and explanations that see regulation as a product of interest-group deals; 75 such deals, in the form of cartelization, were designed to improve the operation of a depressed economy. Sometimes regulation was justified on more conventional economic grounds, such as "market failure" in the form of externalities ignored by the common law or a lack of information on the part of consumers and workers. 76 
substantive rights stressed the essentially undemocratic character of market ordering. In this view, collective control was necessary in order to achieve democracy. 77 Some regulation was thought to be lation in Historical and Comparative Perspective, in REGULATION IN PERSPECTIVE I55 (T. McCraw ed. 1981) and civil rights regulation between the years 1964 and 1977) 
73 For a detailed discussion, see 0. GRAHAM, JR., cited in note I above. The National Industrial Recovery Act, ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195 (1933), exemplifies the movement toward centralization. 
74 See The National Industrial Recovery Act, ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195 (i933). The NIRA, of course, was invalidated in part in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 542 (1935), as an unconstitutional delegation of public power to private groups. Cf. K. DAvIs, supra note z, at 260-75 (arguing that large business interests dominated the NIRA); E. HAWLEY, supra note i, at 270 (same). 
75See generally Becker, A Theory of Competition Among Pressure Groups for Political Influence, 98 Q.J.

ECON. & MGMT. SCI. 3 (1971) (arguing that regulation is designed and operated primarily for the benefit of industry). 
76 Regulations justified on such grounds include the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 301-392 (1982 & Supp. i11 1985), and the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 15x-i68 (1982 & Supp. II 1985).

For better or worse the American people have proclaimed themselves to be a democracy, and they have proclaimed that democracy means popular economic, social, and moral emancipation .... The economic and social changes of the past generation have brought out a serious and a glaring contradiction between the demands of a constructive demo 
HeinOnline -- 101 Harv. L. Rev. 439 1987-1988 should remain with the agency. A promising development in this regard is the recent effort to require agencies to generate timetables and deadlines within which to respond to petitions to engage in rulemaking. 3 13 
Under such a system, neither presidential nor judicial control would be accepted on its own; each would balance the other. In such a system, political choices would be made by those most accountable; the paralysis associated with intra-executive checks and balances would be avoided; collective choices would be permitted; and there would be a safeguard against decisions that do not accord with the law or that stem from factional power or self-interested representation. 
(b) The Continuing Value of Checks and Balances. - The discussion thus far suggests that the New Deal critique of the original distribution of national powers and its checks and balances was contingent on a status quo of laissez-faire and a judiciary hostile to regulation. That critique was badly overdrawn, even (or perhaps especially) if one believes, as the New Deal reformers did, that substantial regulatory intervention is highly desirable in some settings. Four basic factors underlie this conclusion. 
First, a concentration of powers in the presidency or in administrators insulated from congressional or judicial control does not necessarily lead to vigorous enforcement of regulatory programs. Such concentration may instead produce inaction or decisions inconsistent with the commitments underlying the creation of the regulatory scheme. If administrators are fully committed to regulatory goals, checks and balances may seem to be an obstacle to reform; but in a period of executive ambivalence, checks may be an important instrument of statutory implementation. 
Second, the distribution of national powers is far from a guarantor of regulatory inaction. The New Deal critique has its greatest force when a laissez-faire system prevails; it is possible that checks and balances may help to perpetuate that system. For this reason, the critique was more powerful in the 1930's than it is today. If the status quo favors regulatory intervention, however, checks and balances may increase the likelihood that regulation will remain in place. 
Third, a system of distributed powers may in fact help those who seek change, including relatively powerless groups. An important function of the division of powers is to assure that different branches pursue different agendas. The existence of three branches of government thus multiplies the points of access to government, allowing for 313 See Luneberg, Petitionsfor Rulemaking: FederalAgency Practice and Recommendations for Improvement, in ADMINISTRATIVE CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES, RECOMMENDATIONS AND REPORTS 493. The Administrative Law Section of the American Bar Association adopted a recommendation to this effect on October 1o, 1987 (available in Harvard Law School Library). expression of diverse political views. Such a system increases the likelihood that at least one branch will be responsive to the interests of politically weak groups and thus will become an advocate for reform. A single branch often has initiated forms of social change.3 14 For example, the New Deal itself was largely a product of the leadership of one branch of government - the presidency. In a system of centralized and undivided power, by contrast, the likelihood that powerful majorities will remain entrenched is enlarged; no alternative institution exists to pursue interests adverse to the majority. In this sense, a government of separated powers has considerable advantages over more unitary systems. 
Vigorous advocacy by one branch - an option under a system of distributed powers - may thus serve to create momentum for change. Such momentum can be especially strong if one branch has the power to produce reform largely on its own - if, in short, government does not merely check and balance itself but is truly divided. The current constitutional structure to a large degree meets this condition because all three branches are able to generate change independently. In these circumstances, the New Deal belief that the original distribution of national powers would inevitably produce inaction, or inevitably frustrate governmental intervention, is unfounded. 
Fourth, and finally, even if a system of checks and balances may sometimes decrease the rate and amount of change, rapid change is hardly always desirable. In any case, the risks of too little change may be worth incurring in order to decrease factionalism and increase deliberation in government. The concentration of power in regulatory agencies may increase responsiveness to swings in popular opinion, but such responsiveness is far from an inevitable good. A balanced system of oversight of the sort recommended here is thus preferable both to the New Deal conception of administrative autonomy and to partial systems of control as represented, for example, in recommendations for increased presidential control and decreased judicial review.3 15 
314 Judicial oversight of executive agencies, when the President has been skeptical of regulatory enforcement in many areas, is the most recent example. The judiciary has also initiated substantial changes in the criminal justice system. See, e.g., Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (I966); Batson v. Kentucky, io6 S. Ct. 1712 (1986) (holding that the equal protection clause forbids a prosecutor from challenging potential jurors solely on account of their race). Congress likewise has brought about significant reform in environmental protection. See Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 7401-7642 (1982); Ackerman, Elliot & Millian, Toward a Theory of Statutory Evolution: The Federalizationof EnvironmentalLaw, i J.L., ECON. & ORG. 313, 317-18, 33538 (1985) (describing the circumstances surrounding passage of the Clean Air Act). 
31s To be sure, some difficulties accompany the present system of checks and balances, quite outside the area of administrative law. In particular, the current regime makes it especially difficult for the President to implement his program, with the occasional exception of vigorous action at the beginning of the presidential term. More generally, the split between the executive 
At the same time, it is important to be realistic about the value of institutional changes of the kind proposed here. Indeed, a focus on institutional checks tends to perpetuate the possibly anachronistic preoccupation of administrative law with control of discretion. 3 16 Regulatory performance, for example, depends on a wide range of factors other than institutional arrangements. Appropriations, quality of personnel, distributions of social power, ideological commitment, public attitudes, and substantive regulatory controls all play critical roles. 3 17 The various changes suggested here by themselves will not cure excessive regulation and implementation failure. Improvement of the regulatory process must be accompanied by a variety of other reforms, 3 18 some of which are discussed below. Nonetheless, institutional changes should make a substantial difference. The increase in presidential, judicial, and congressional control is likely to serve the institutional purposes of the original constitutional structure without at the same time returning to anachronistic conceptions of limited government. 
The simultaneous rise of executive, judicial, and legislative control has been accompanied by growing doubts about the constitutional status of regulatory agencies. Administration has of course been an important part of the national government since the founding. 3 19 The recent constitutional doubts, reminiscent of pre-New Deal challenges to the regulatory process, do not challenge administration in general, but only particular aspects that are perceived as threats to basic constitutional principles. Some of those doubts manifest themselves in renewed efforts to use the nondelegation doctrine to limit agency discretion. 320 Others form the impetus to urge courts to interpret article III literally and thus to remove adjudicative functions from regulatory agencies. 3 2 1 The most important set of challenges question congressional power to create agencies independent of the President. 
In all these cases, the basic concern is that regulatory agencies combining traditionally separated functions and immunized from presidential control are subject to the risk of factionalism and self-interested representation. The question of congressional authority to create "independent" agencies is closely associated with the issues explored thus far; it too calls for an analysis of the relationship between the system of checks and balances on the one hand and New Deal constitutionalism on the other. 
The independent agency, defined as an agency whose members are not subject to the plenary removal power of the President, is the model of the New Deal institution. It received constitutional sanction largely on the ground that the Constitution could not be read to bar expert and insulated officials from designing regulatory policy at the request of Congress, even though these officials do not fall within any of the constitutionally specified branches. 322 This understanding has met sharp criticism in the last decade, 323 however, and it would not be surprising to see a fundamental attack on the concept of independent administration in the near future. Such an attack would be the constitutional analogue of the increasing distrust of New Deal administration, manifested in the growth of legislative, presidential, and judicial control. 
These attacks on various aspects of modern administration, however, are flawed. They rest on methods of constitutional interpretation that are inadequate, especially in the context of administrative law. Literal interpretation of the constitutional text and the intent of its drafters is unhelpful in light of vast changes in the national government since the founding era. These changes call for an approach that takes changed circumstances into account, but at the same time reintroduces into the regulatory process some of the safeguards of the original constitutional system.

Soc'v Y.B. io3, xo6-,io (questioning the distinction between executive agencies and independent agencies and contending that the holding in Humphrey's Executor should be limited to its factual and historical context). i. Formalism, Holmesianism, and Functionalism.- The last few years have seen a sharp rise of constitutional "formalism" in cases involving the separation of powers. Formalist decisions are premised on the beliefs that the text of the Constitution and the intent of its drafters are controlling and sometimes dispositive, that changed circumstances are irrelevant to constitutional outcomes, and that broader "policy" concerns should not play a role in legal decisions. Although this type of analysis was most prominent during the early growth of the modern regulatory state, 324 recent decisions also reflect some of these ideas. For example, in Buckley v. Valeo, 325 the Supreme Court struck down provisions of the Federal Election Act on the ground that members of the Federal Election Commission were not appointed by the President. Similarly, in INS v. Chadha,32 6 the Court invalidated the legislative veto on the grounds that it violated the presentation clause and evaded the constitutional requirement of bicameralism. And in Bowsher v. Synar,327 the Court invalidated the GrammRudman-Hollings Act on the ground that article II prohibits Congress from granting to itself the exclusive power to remove an officer charged with the execution of the law. All of these decisions treated the text of the Constitution and the intent of its drafters as if they supplied clear, self-evident answers to the problem at hand. Changed circumstances and even underlying considerations of constitutional structure were largely ignored. 
Constitutional formalism of this sort rests on weak foundations. The formalist approach is vulnerable to a wide range of objections relating to the appropriate characterization of the framers' intent, 328 the problem of interpretive intent, and the question how intent should be treated in unforeseen circumstances. 329 In the context of administrative law, the critical problem for formalism lies in the massive alterations in the executive branch since the New Deal. Formalist approaches assert, for example, that the notion of a "unitary executive" is sufficient to resolve many questions involving federal administrative agencies. But the federal government and the executive branch in particular have changed so dramatically since the founding that "framers' intent" cannot be mechanically applied as if it settles the matter. 
324 See, e.g., Hampton & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 404-11 (1928); Field v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649 (1892). For a modern example, see Currie, The Distribution of Powers After Bowsher, 1986 SuP. CT. REV. 19.

The modern presidency is so different from the entity contemplated by the framers that it is unrealistic simply to "apply" their choices to the present situation. At its inception, the American presidency was by modern standards weak, especially in domestic affairs. 330 Its regulatory role was minimal. Police powers were exercised principally by the states. Federal lawmaking was the province of Congress. General questions of regulation were decided by the state legislatures and common law courts. Since the New Deal, however, the executive branch has become a major national policymaker; it often takes the initiative in lawmaking, exercising powers originally thought to lie within the domain of Congress and the states. 33 1 
For this reason, the Supreme Court's reasoning in Chadha and Bowsher was far too mechanical. The constitutionality of the legislative veto cannot be resolved solely by reference to the constitutional text. 332 For similar reasons, efforts to reinvigorate a literal approach to article III in order to remove adjudication from the executive branch should be resisted. 333 A general revival of the nondelegation doctrine would also be a mistake in light of a range of considerations: good reasons support the delegation of discretion, 334 standards can be extrapolated from seemingly vague statutes, judicial administration of a nondelegation principle would be both difficult and intrusive, and surrogate safeguards are available. 33 5 Of course, extreme measures, like that in Schechter Poultry, should be invalidated. 
At the opposite pole from constitutional formalism is a position that one might associate with Justice Holmes: courts should presume that whatever Congress does in the area of separation of powers is constitutional, unless no plausible argument can be made in its favor.336 Under the "Holmesian" view, separation of powers questions are essentially nonjusticiable, because the relevant institutions are able to protect themselves. 3 37 Some observers have argued in favor of a Holmesian approach on the ground that changed circumstances make the original constitutional commitments less relevant or more obscure. 338 Others have adopted the position because of the alleged 330 See T. Lowi, supra note 83, at 22-41.

Bowsher indeterminacy of the constitutional text.3 39 In the 1930's, the Supreme Court used a Holmesian approach to decide several cases involving separation of powers issues and administrative agencies, 34 0 but it has not done so recently. 
The Holmesian approach, however, is little better than formalism. In its usual form, it amounts to a wholesale abandonment of the separation of powers, and its belief in a self-calibrating institutional equilibrium, based on the supposedly equal power of the opposing forces, is without historical or theoretical support. There is good reason to suppose that without adequate controls one branch will sometimes exercise too much power over the others. 34 1 One of the purposes of the Constitution was to prevent that outcome and to check imbalances when they occur.34 2 Acquiescence by one branch to a redistribution of national powers may not prevent - indeed it may increase - the danger that the new arrangement will jeopardize some of the purposes that underlie the constitutional structure. The Holmesian position, effectively immunizing political outcomes from constitutional checks, is therefore inadequate. 
The alternative to formalism and Holmesianism might be described as functionalism. 343 In general terms, functional approaches examine whether present practices undermine constitutional commitments that should be regarded as central. The text of the Constitution and the intent of its drafters are relevant, but they are not sufficiently helpful in hard cases to be determinative; it is the basic structural principles that play the critical role. 3 44 As suggested above, those principles include the unitary execution of the laws, avoidance of factionalism, protection against self-interested or unaccountable representation, and v. Synar, io6 S. Ct. 3181, 3205 (1986) (White, J., dissenting) (noting the importance of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act as a response to the budget crisis).

Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 53-54 (1932) (arguing that a congressional grant of limited adjudicative powers to a non-article III tribunal can be justified to the extent it relieves the judiciary of an excessive workload). 
341 See, e.g., United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952). 
342 Moreover, the fact that the legislative and executive branches are in agreement is an insufficient reason to foreclose a constitutional attack; the relevant provisions are designed not only to ensure the integrity of the branches but also to protect the citizenry. See Chadha,462 U.S. at 947-51, 957-59. 
343 See Strauss, Formal and FunctionalApproaches to Separation-of-PowersQuestions - A Foolish Inconsistency?, 72 CORNELL L. REV. 482, 488-89 (1987) (contrasting formalist and functionalist approaches to separation of powers issues). 
344 This method can be traced to McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (i81g). See generally C. BLACK, STRUCTURE AND RELATIONSHIP IN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW (1970) (arguing that the method of reasoning from structure and relation should play an important role in federal constitutional law). [Vol. 1O1:421 promotion of deliberation in government. 345 A functional approach maintains, for example, that the constitutionality of the legislative veto should not have been resolved solely by reference to the text. 3 46 Nonetheless, a functional approach would yield the same result as in Chadha. Practice had shown that the legislative veto aggravated the problem of factionalism 34 7 - the very problem it was designed to solve. In practice, the device provided well-organized private groups an additional opportunity to fend off regulation. In this way, it undermined the central constitutional effort to diminish the power of well-organized private groups over governmental processes. 
Although Bowsher is a harder case, it can be analyzed similarly. The congressional vesting of power in the Comptroller General removed the power of execution of the laws from the direct control of executive officials because, in practice, the Comptroller General operated independently of the President. 348 Execution of the laws was thus placed in the hands of someone who was, in practice, accountable to no one. An- alternative defense of Bowsher would point to the dangers of combining legislative and executive functions, because the Comptroller General is subject to congressional removal and has traditionally viewed himself as a congressional agent. 
Of course, there are problems with the functional approach as well. In particular, it allows for a large degree of discretion (and therefore uncertainty) both in characterizing the appropriate constitutional commitment and in deciding whether it has been violated. By contrast, the formalist and Holmesian approaches are highly predictable. The vices of functionalism in this regard can also be regarded as virtues, however, because they permit functionalism to avoid the defects in formal and Holmesian approaches. 
tutional formalism has been of special importance in recent attacks on "independent" agencies. Although the first independent agency, the Interstate Commerce Commission, was created in the late nineteenth century, the notion of agency independence did not become popular until several decades later, as a result of fears about an unduly powerful presidency and an accompanying belief in the salutary effects of impartial expertise. 34 9 In part, the rise of independent agencies can also be viewed as an indication of the power of private industries, which believed that commissions would treat them more favorably. 35 0 345See supra pp. 430-36.

A Comment on the Supreme Court'sLegislative Veto Decision, 1983 DUKE L.J. 789, 8oo-oi. 347 See Bruff & Gellhorn, supra note 121, at 1413-14, 1425-26, 1438-39. 348 See Strauss, supra note 343, at 5,9-21. 349See M. BERNSTEIN, supra note 3, at 128-29, 137-39; Miller, supra note 323, at 79-83. 350 See M. BERNSTEIN, supra note 3, at 5; id. at 146 (arguing that "maintenance of the The New Deal saw the creation of a number of independent agencies, although, as with the Interstate Commerce Commission, limitations on presidential removal power predated the New Deal. 35 ' The form has been much less popular in the last twenty years, partly because of a perception that independent agencies have been, in practice, subject to the influence of well-organized private groups. 3 52 
The notion of independent administration is congruent with the Madisonian conception of representation in its desire to insulate public officials from political pressures. 3 53 But the New Deal conception of administration coupled the belief in insulation with optimism about the power of immersion in the facts and of technical expertise to resolve regulatory problems. Moreover, the advocates of the New Deal saw insulation as a mechanism for disrupting rather than preserving the status quo - a reversal of the view of the constitutional framers. The independent agency was a natural outgrowth of the New Deal plan. 
Despite some continuity with Madisonian theory, the independent agency is in considerable tension with principles traceable to the origmyth of commission independence represents a conscious effort by regulated groups to confine regulatory authority to an agency that is somewhat more susceptible than an executive department to influence, persuasion, and eventually, capture and control"); see also D. TRUMAN, THE GOVERNMENTAL PROCESS 417-19 (2d ed. 1971) (asserting that regulated groups have preferred regulation by independent agencies to supervision by an executive commission). 351 See infra notes 358-61. 
352 An influential critique of agency independence written thirty years ago can be found in M. BERNSTEIN, cited in note 3 above. For a contrary view, see Jaffe, cited in note 126 above, at 1187, 1193, 1198--99. The decline of agency independence apparently reflects the belief that presidential supervision will operate as a buffer against factionalism. The EPA and OSHA are within the executive branch. Only a few of the modern safety and health statutes are administered by independent agencies. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 717i(a) (1982) (the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission); I5 U.S.C. § 2053(a) (1982) (the Consumer Product Safety Commission). Recent history thus suggests considerable congressional ambivalence about the independent agency. 
In practice, there is little difference between independent and executive agencies in terms of their functions. Many departments within the executive branch engage in activities that are indistinguishable from those of the independent agencies. Both types of entities undertake the basic tasks of adjudication, rulemaking, and prosecution. Moreover, independent agencies are by no means genuinely liberated from political control. Such agencies perceive themselves as subject to the control of Congress, whose committees exercise a powerful supervisory function. The President, furthermore, has a range of formal and informal mechanisms for controlling agencies nominally outside of his jurisdiction. See Strauss, supra note 43, at 589-91; see also M. BERNSTEIN, supra note 3, at 109-13 (describing such mechanisms). Indeed, a recent study suggests that the behavior of independent agencies varies systematically with presidential partisanship. See Moe, Regulatory Performance and PresidentialAdministration, 26 AM. J. POL. SCI. 197, 221 (1982). In some cases, however, Congress has decided that immunity from plenary presidential control is desirable. There can be no doubt that independence allows agencies some measure of insulation from presidential authority and increases the supervisory power of legislative committees, which need not contend with the insulating effect of presidential support. 353 See Sunstein, supra note 33, at 41-43; supra pp. 430-32. inal constitutional framework. The first section of article II vests executive power in "a President. '35 4 The "take Care" clause makes it the duty of the President, and no one else, to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed."355 These provisions reflect the framers' self-conscious decision to create a unitary executive who would be both accountable to the electorate and capable of energetic execution of the laws. 
This basic understanding of the executive branch found powerful vindication in Myers v. United States,35 6 in which the Supreme Court held that Congress could not involve itself in the decision whether to remove a postniaster. 35 7 In Humphrey's Executor v. United States,358 however, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the constitutionality of the independent agencies. Referring to the need for expertise and impartiality, the Court stated that the members of the FTC were to be independent in all things but their appointment, and that the FTC was not "in any proper sense ... an arm or an eye of the executive. ' 35 9 For the Court, the Commission "acts in part quasi-legislatively and in part quasi-judicially" and is "an agency of the legislative and judicial departments." 3 60 At least until recently, Humphrey's Executor has been interpreted ag establishing congressional discretion to create independent agencies as long as the relevant officials have adjudicative or rulemaking functions. 36 1 
Skepticism about the constitutional status of the independent agency has been renewed in the last decade, however,3 62 and there are signs that the legal meaning of independence will change in the near future. Such developments should not be surprising in light of 354 U.S. CONST. art. II, § i, cl. i. 355 Id. § 3. 356 272 U.S. 52 (1926). 
357 See id. at 163-64 ("Article II grants to the President.. . the power of appointment and removal of executive officers - a conclusion confirmed by his obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed."). 
3s8 295 U.S. 602 (I935). 359 Id. at 628. 360 Id.at 628, 630. 
361 The claim that Humphrey'sExecutor held that rulemaking is quasi-legislative is, however, a misunderstanding. At the time of Humphrey's Executor, it had not been established that the FTC had rulemaking power. By "quasi-legislative" functions, the Court was referring to investigatory and reportorial actions. See Scalia, supra note 323, at lo9. 
Strictly speaking, Humphrey's Executor is an exceedingly narrow holding. The Court held only that a discharged member of the FTC has a right to back pay. The case did not involve a suit for reinstatement, and thus the Court did not conclude that Congress may ensure job tenure - only that compensation is due to those whom the President discharges. Moreover, the case did not involve a discharge on the ground of a refusal to implement presidential policy. 
362 See generally Miller, supranote 323, at 83 (noting the questionable constitutional grounds on which independent agencies are based); Note, Incorporation of Independent Agencies into the Executive Branch, 94 YALE L.J. 1766 (1985) (arguing that Humphrey's Executor should be overruled and that independent agencies should be incorporated into the executive branch). the declining faith in the New Deal model of administration, which put a high premium on insulation. This skepticism has been boosted by the formalist approach of recent Supreme Court decisions - an approach that is in severe tension with the analysis in Humphrey's Executor, which in any event has little to be said in its behalf. The notion of quasi-legislative and quasi-adjudicative functions, pivotal to the decision, is unhelpful. 363 The simple point for the formalist critics is that the Constitution makes no room for a governmental entity existing "outside" the three enumerated branches, and constitutional silence suggests that no such entity may exist. Constitutional formalism provides at least as powerful an argument against the existence of independent agencies as it offers against the Gramm-RudmanHollings Act and the legislative veto. The President, not independent administrators, is the constitutionally specified agent of Congress in the execution of federal law. 
There are, however, several counterarguments to the formalist position. The text of the Constitution and its history 364 do not provide unambiguous support for the attack on independent administration; and the changing character of the modern presidency makes it unrealistic to rely on founders' intent or to pretend that it can be mechanically applied to current problems. In light of the massive changes in the nature of the presidency, the decision to create a unitary executive cannot be treated as if it resolved the matter. Indeed, the decision to permit the creation of "independent" agencies might be understood as a necessary quid pro quo for the downfall of the nondelegation doctrine. The independent agency device allows Congress to limit presidential power in lawmaking, which has assumed unprecedented dimensions since the New Deal. In this sense, it might be thought to bring the national government closer to the original system of checks and balances. 
Moreover, the term "independent" is in practice a misnomer. There are lines of control from both Congress and the President to the independent agencies. 365 Even if the Constitution might bar Congress from creating regulatory agencies entirely immune from presidential control, congressional creation of independent agencies need not be understood in such terms. 
Although the formalist attack against independent agencies was at least implicitly at issue in Bowsher, the Court attempted to evade the problem. The Court indicated that its decision had no bearing on the constitutionality of the concept of independent administration. 366 The 363 See Miller, supra note 323, at 93. 
364 See Grundstein, PresidentialPower, Administration and Administrative Law, 18 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 285, 289-326 (ig5o). 
365 See Strauss, supra note 43, at 587-96; supra note 352. 366 See Bowsher v. Synar, io6 S. Ct. 3181, 3188 n.4 (1986). Court's language in Bowsher, however, may have an impact on the issue, in ways that fit comfortably with a functional approach to the question. The Court held that the enumerated bases for removal of the Comptroller General by Congress - inefficiency, neglect of duty, abuse of office - were "very broad" and permitted discharge "for any number of actual or perceived transgressions of the legislative will." 36 7 Yet the statutes creating independent agencies use almost precisely the same language. If this language creates "very broad" removal authority, the so-called independent agencies are not in practice independent of presidential control. 368 
Whatever the ultimate meaning of agency independence, and whether or not it is found constitutional, it should not be surprising if the recent attacks on independence and the related decline in the New Deal conception of administration eventually lead to increased presidential control of all regulatory agencies. Such a development would be highly desirable. Understood functionally, total independence threatens central principles of electoral accountability. There is evidence that the lack of accountability of independent regulatory agencies has led to abuses. 3 69 The constitutional commitments to the avoidance of factionalism and to limitations on the disjunction between rulers and ruled tend to support presidential supervision. The various policies underlying the notion of a unitary presidency are also relevant.3 70 
In any event, there is no reason to believe that the independent agency form - if independence is understood literally - is needed to carry out the principal substantive purposes of New Deal administration.3 7 1 Moreover, such control increases the likelihood of achieving an irriportant institutional goal of the New Deal - to provide for agency officials who serve public law. At the same time, presidential supervision of independent agencies would be an additional step in the reintroduction of checks and balances into the current administrative process, supplementing the various measures described and advocated above. 
367 Id. at 3190. 
368 This conclusion is buttressed by clear-statement principles of statutory construction, which counsel courts to avoid interpretations of statutes that pose constitutional issues. See, e.g., Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, 127-30 (1958) (construing statute so as to avoid constitutional questions). Under this approach, statutes with ambiguous language should be read to allow considerable presidential supervisory power. 
369 See M. BERNSTEIN, supra note 3. 
370 See id. at 163, 286-87; NATIONAL ACADEMY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, supra note 145, at 15-20. 
371 Some independence, however, is necessary if the agency is to serve any role at all. For example, although the President may not make the ultimate decision, a point recognized in Myers itself, he may remove an officer after the decision is made. See supra p. 498. Moreover, agencies require some independence when acting in an adjudicatory mode. See Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 135 (1926). IV. REGULATION, RIGHTS, AND LOCAL SELF-DETERMINATION The discussion thus far has dealt primarily with the challenge of the New Deal to the system of checks and balances and with the reaction to those innovations in the last quarter-century. As discussed above, however, the New Deal significantly altered two other aspects of the constitutional structure: individual rights and federalism. The New Deal reformers rejected common law and status quo baselines for defining substantive entitlements, and believed that the presidency and regulatory agencies provided better opportunities than state and local government for democratic self-determination. A complete discussion of constitutionalism after the New Deal must thus address not only the questions of national institutions, but also those involving individual rights and federalism. Such a discussion must also deal with substantive, as opposed to institutional, reform of administrative law. 3 72 For present purposes, a few brief remarks should suffice. 
The New Deal reformers asserted that the catalog of rights protected by the common law was not natural or prepolitical, but a conscious social choice.3 7 3 This understanding dramatically shifted the baseline for distinguishing between governmental "action" and "inaction," or neutrality and impermissible partisanship - a point that modern public law has insufficiently recognized. In the pre-New Deal era, courts sometimes viewed deviations from the common law and the status quo as interference with the natural order, and as impermissible violations of principles of neutrality and nonpartisanship. This was the understanding that prevailed in the Lochner era, during which an aggressive Supreme Court identified the requirements of the due process clause with those of the common law.3 74 
When the Court rejected Lochner, it did so largely on the ground that the common law baseline from which the Court had been operating could no longer be justified. 3 75 The Court recognized that re372 See generally S. BREYER, supra note 26 (presenting a general analysis of regulatory reform); Stewart, supra note 318 (advocating the adoption of "reconstitutive" regulatory strategies as an alternative to both reliance on current regulatory systems and deregulation). 373 See supra p. 423. 
374 See New York Cent. R.R. v. White, 243 U.S. 188, 201 (,9,7) (suggesting that if government abrogates common law rights it must provide a "reasonably just substitute"). See generally Sunstein, supra note 135 (describing the influence of common law baselines). 
375 It should be unsurprising that the same Court that rejected the Lochner era understanding decided Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), in which the common law was similarly found to be constructed rather than natural or prepolitical. See West Coast Hotel v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379, 399 (,937) (finding that failure to have a minimum wage law is a "subsidy" to employers); Miller v. Schoene, 276 U.S. 272, 279 (1928) (stating that failure to regulate is "nonetheless a choice"). spect for the common law baseline and for the existing distribution of wealth and entitlements could itself be governmental "action" or the product of faction; the common law was itself a creation of the legal system.3 7 6 The lesson of the demise of Lochner was that common law or status quo baselines should no longer be used reflexively in public law. 
Notwithstanding this understanding, pre-New Deal conceptions of legal rights permeate modern public law. For example, doctrines of judicial review of administrative action depend importantly on the common law. The interests of regulatory beneficiaries are not always judicially cognizable, most significantly in the areas of standing and judicial review of agency inaction. 3 77 State action doctrine turns not on whether the state has "acted," but on whether it has departed from governmental functions that are seen as normal or natural, 378 largely from a -common law point of view. The partial abrogation of a trespass law is thus uncontroversially state action, and possibly unconstitutional, 379 whereas the enforcement of the law of trespass, and the repeal of a law prohibiting private racial discrimination, are treated as constitutionally legitimate and perhaps do not represent 376 Cf. F.D. Roosevelt, Speech Accepting the Nomination for the Presidency (July 2, 1932), I THE PUBLIC PAPERS OF FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, THE GENESIS OF THE NEw DEAL, 19281932, at 657 (1938) (suggesting that the laws of economics "are made by human beings" rather than "nature"); F.D. Roosevelt, Annual Message to Congress (Jan. 3, 1936), 5 THE PUBLIC PAPERS AND ADDRESSES OF FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, THE PEOPLE APPROVE, 1936, at 13 (1938) ("In these latter years we have witnessed the domination of government by financial and industrial groups .... [Under the New Deal there has been] an appeal from the clamor of many private and selfish interests ... to the ideal of the public interest. Government became the representative and the trustee of the public interest. Our aim ... was to build upon essentially democratic institutions, seeking.., the adjustment of burdens, the help of the needy, the protection of the weak, the liberation of the exploited, and the genuine protection of the people's property."); F.D. Roosevelt, Message to Congress, H.R. Doc. No. 397, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. (1934), reprinted in STATUTORY HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES: INCOME SECURITY 61 (R. Stevens ed. 1970) (defending social security as necessary protection in "this man-made world of ours" (emphasis added)); infra note 386 (citing sources discussing the contextual nature of social thought). 
This view of law as a social construct was an outgrowth of legal realism. See Hale, supra note ii,at 493-94. The Coase theorem, see Coase, The Problem of Social Cost, 3 J.L. & ECON. i (ig6o), was a natural product of New Deal understandings. It, too, upset ordinary understandings of action and inaction by revealing that judgments about causation, or about who injured whom, were conventional rather than natural. See B. ACKERMAN, supra note 135, at 46-7, (1985). The Coase theorem was thus the private law analogue to the constitutional overruling of Lochner. 
PP. 474-78. 
378 See Sunstein, supra note 135, at 214. 
379 See PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 83-84 (198o) (upholding a partial abrogation of state trespass law, but implying that a more extensive abrogation would constitute a taking); Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S. 164, 179-80 (1979) (holding that the right to exclude is an incident of ownership). state action at all. 380 Similarly, the right to a hearing depends in part on whether a common law interest or instead an interest thought to be "created by the government" is at stake. The law of procedural due process thus reflects a distinction, based on common law categories, between natural and positive rights38 1 - a distinction that was repudiated during the New Deal. 
The debate over "positive" and "negative" rights also depends on the choice of baselines. Whether a right is "positive" or "negative" turns out to depend largely on whether it calls for alterations in existing practices. The selection of such baselines has been particularly critical in cases involving the imposition of "affirmative" duties on government: The protection of the trespass laws is thus generally perceived as a negative guarantee, whereas protection of welfare rights is viewed as a positive one. 3 82 Distinctions of this sort turn not on a genuine inquiry into the negative or positive character of the rights, but on whether they require government to depart from common law categories. 
Cases involving discrimination on the basis of race and gender raise similar issues. Thus, for example, the constitutional attack on "affirmative action" - indeed the very term - depends on acceptance, as a baseline, of the existing distribution of benefits and burdens as between blacks and whites and women and men. If the existing distribution were seen as a product of public and private decisions, it would be harder to argue that indifference to race, as reflected in market outcomes, was the course of "neutrality" or "inaction." Similarly, gender-discrimination law is marked by a debate whether some differences are "real" rather than socially constructed. 3 83 An approach consistent with New Deal understandings would recognize that even "real" differences are given their meaning by legal and social practices. 384 Such an approach would recognize, for example, that the 380 See Crawford v. Board of Educ., 458 U.S. 527, 538-39 (1982) (suggesting that "mere repeal" of state antidiscrimination law is constitutional); Reitman v. Mulkey, 387 U.S. 369 (1967) (invalidating a state constitutional provision overturning antidiscrimination statutes, but indicating that repeal of those statutes is by itself permissible). 
381 See Cleveland v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985); Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564 (1972). 
382 See, e.g., Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (198o) (distinguishing limitations on the government's power to regulate abortion from an affirmative obligation to finance such operations). 
383 See Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 204 (1976) (stating that statistical demonstration of broad sociological propositions "isin tension with the normative philosophy underlying the equal protection clause"). See generally C. MACKINNON, FEMINISM UNMODIFIED 32-45 (1987) (suggesting an approach to gender discrimination that focuses on the ways in which differences are turned into disadvantages, rather than on the ways in which differences arise). 384 See C. MAcKINNON, supra note 383, at 32-40; Minow, The Supreme Cou'rt, z986 Term Foreword:Justice Engendered, io HARv. L. REv. 10, 34-36 (1987) (describing the connection between legal analysis and categorization). legal treatment of reproductive rights and of abortion raises questions not only of privacy, but also of sex discrimination. 385 
A major task for the future is to bring the basic understanding of the New Deal - the socially constructed character of legal rights to bear on current doctrine. 386 Such a step would produce significant shifts in the baselines from which decisions are made. 387 The eventual goal would be to produce a theory of legal rights that is sometimes critical of existing practice, that is not merely positivist, and that does not rely on the status quo or the common law as the foundation from which to evaluate legal outcomes. That task is a large one, and it is doubtful that the courts can perform it on their own. The legislative and executive branches must play an important role. The effort, discussed above, 3 88 to place the interests of regulatory beneficiaries on the same footing as those of regulated industries would be an important step in this direction, and it might serve as a model for future development. 
In the original constitutional system, federalism provided an avenue for local self-determination. Self-government by the citizenry could be achieved through state and local government. 3 89 At the same time, the states and the national government would control each other,3 90 generating a vertical check on government oppression. Competition among the states for residents would act as an additional safeguard, encouraging humane and efficient policies. 
In the New Deal period, however, the belief in localism seemed unrealistic or perverse. State government seemed to be a forum for parochial pressures rather than for republican self-government. 3 9 1 The states were far too large to allow for face-to-face democracy. The notion of vertical checks and balances among competing local and federal spheres seemed inconsistent with the need for active govern385 See C. MAcKINNON, supra note 383, at 32-45. 
386 Such a task connects legal theory to prominent themes in contemporary social thought, involving the inevitably situated character of observation. See generally G.

Competition among the states would generate a "race to the bottom" that would both harm the disadvantaged and prevent coordinated action. New Deal reformers willingly abandoned the belief in self-determination through local government and looked instead to national institutions, and in particular to regulatory agencies and to the presidency, to fulfill democratic aspirations. 3 92 
In the 1930's, there was good reason for this basic position. Economic conditions, in particular, made local measures appear hopelessly inadequate. In retrospect, however, the New Deal's wholesale abandonment of the original goals of federalism was myopic. The New Deal actors were far too cavalier in their treatment of the problem. National institutions are at best an imperfect arena for obtaining selfdetermination by the citizenry, and federal controls are often excessively rigid and inefficient. The presidency itself, although visible, is hardly a forum for republican self-government. More importantly, experience has shown that the New Deal faith that autonomous administration would serve democratic goals was unjustified. The modern administrative agency has attenuated the links between citizens and governmental processes. Although reinvigoration of checks and balances should increase the democratic character of federal administration, it is no longer credible to believe that federal agencies can serve as an outlet for democratic aspirations. In this respect, the original framework of dual sovereignty was far superior to the New Deal understanding. 
In the last quarter-century, there have been numerous efforts to provide mechanisms to ensure citizen participation in the public and private spheres. 393 The task for the future is to incorporate New Deal understandings about the potentially destructive consequences of interstate competition, 3 94 and more recent perceptions of the frequently negative effect of state autonomy on disadvantaged groups, 3 95 into a 392 See sources cited supra note 391.

That task is also a large one, but it is possible to identify some promising reforms. One strategy would be to reformulate national regulatory schemes, taking the form of prescriptive rules, through a sort of "reconstitutive law" that allows increased state, local, and private flexibility.396 Reconstitutive approaches do not attempt to mandate particular results; they are thus distinguished from, for example, national occupational or health standards and "command and control" regulation requiring companies or states to reduce pollution to a certain level by specified means at a specified time. Reconstitutive approaches attempt to promote regulatory purposes through such flexible methods as reallocating entitlements, altering procedures, or shifting jurisdictional boundaries. Such methods encourage but do not compel particular outcomes; instead, they create incentives or pressures that nonetheless allow for private and local flexibility in a restructured marketplace. 
Some reconstitutive approaches include protecting and encouraging collective bargaining in labor law instead of imposing uniform national standards, 3 97 providing for tradable emissions permits instead of mandating national pollution controls, 39 8 allowing diverse forms of broadcasting regulations in different communities, and relaxing conditions in federal grant programs. 39 9 In the area of welfare and social services, states might also be granted some powers currently reserved to the federal government. Such an effort might have as its purpose the encouragement of experimentation and diversity in job training for the unemployed. Another approach to promoting self-determination is the movement toward economic and workplace democracy, 400 which has the advantage of seeking participation and self-determination in areas in which citizens are already actively engaged. 40 1 In all of these

For a more cautious but nonetheless sanguine view, see E. GREENBERG, WORKPLACE DEMOCRACY: contexts, state and local officials might be given authority to establish procedures and to impose different sorts of controls. The national government could create ceilings and floors that permit local discretion. 
Strategies of this sort, however, should be undertaken only in certain areas. As the New Deal reformers were aware, competition among the states has a dark side. States often try to outbid each other in an effort to attract job- and revenue-producing industries by eliminating desirable regulation, 40 2 such as occupational health and safety measures. In addition, competitive pressures make minimal guarantees of income and social services extremely difficult to furnish at the state level. 40 3 In some contexts, moreover, a national moral commitment, often having constitutional foundations, calls for uniform federal standards - a point that is buttressed by the frequently negative effects of state and local autonomy on traditionally disadvantaged groups. 40 4 Discrimination on the basis of race and gender is a particularly inapt area for devolution of regulatory control to the states. The case for national requirements is thus strongest when interstate competition reduces regulation and income redistribution below the optimal level, when there are interstate spillovers or freerider effects, and when powerful moral commitments call for uniformity. 
The case for deregulation and devolution to state and local authorities often depends on the purpose of a regulatory scheme. Some regulatory schemes are designed to promote economic goals; 40 5 some are redistributive; 40 6 others are designed to protect rights. 407 Some regulatory programs are also intended to shape preferences, 40 8 to reflect the outcome of deliberative processes among the citizenry or representatives, or to promote noncommodity or public values. 40 9 Such measures include regulation of broadcasting, protection of the environment, 4 10 and prohibition of discrimination on the basis of race THE POLITICAL EFFECTS OF PARTICIPATION (1986), which analyzes the effects of workplace democracy in Pacific Northwest plywood cooperatives.

The basic goal of deregulation, devolution, and reconstitutive strategies is to promote economic productivity, diversity, and flexibility, while recognizing the need, on both economic and noneconomic grounds, for substantial national intervention into private markets. By relaxing national controls, these strategies would also promote selfdetermination at the local level. Such strategies should be seen above all as an effort to integrate the New Deal reformation of rights with the existence, in the original constitutional regime, of opportunities for local self-determination. Movements toward local control are thus the analogue, at the vertical level, to the revival of the system of checks and balances at the horizontal level. In concert, such reforms will promote the purposes of the original constitutional plan without relying on common law or status quo baselines or retreating to anachronistic understandings of private rights. 
V. CONCLUSION 
The distribution of national powers was designed to ensure a sensible division of labor, to promote deliberation in government, and to provide a series of checks against factional power and self-interested representation. The original constitutional framework was also associated with the system of common law ordering, because the scheme of checks and balances made national action more difficult, thus allowing states and the common law courts to set the basic terms of regulation. 
In its substantive dimension, New Deal constitutionalism self-consciously rejected the common law. It held that a new conception of legal rights was necessary to protect workers, the poor, the elderly, consumers, and others disadvantaged by the marketplace. Above all, New Deal constitutionalism recognized that baselines derived from the common law or the status quo no longer provided neutral or natural standpoints from which to make legal decisions. 
The institutional position of the New Deal followed naturally from this critique. In the view of the 193o's reformers, the original distribution of national powers obstructed necessary governmental action. The New Deal alternative was both to increase the power of the presidency and to create the modern administrative agency, comprised of technically sophisticated officials promoting the public interest. New Deal agencies were expected to energize government and to 411 See, e.g., Lawrence, supra note 81, at 350-51. escape the paralysis associated with the judiciary and the system of checks and balances. 
The New Deal period thus saw a simultaneous attack on the substantive and the institutional legacy of the original constitutional regime. New Deal constitutionalism maintained a measure of continuity with the Madisonian belief in deliberative government, but the reformers of the 1930's intended deliberation to result in reconstruction rather than preservation of the existing distribution of wealth and entitlements. 
The last three decades have seen a growing rejection of the New Deal conception of administration, although the substantive critique of the common law has remained largely intact. Because they lack internal checks and balances, administrative agencies pose special risks from the standpoint of the traditional distribution of national powers. Dangers of factionalism and self-interested representation have been the foremost concern of modern administrative law. Most proposals for regulatory reform, whether judicial, executive, or legislative, stem from that preoccupation. 
The demise of the New Deal institutional structure first manifested itself in the courts, as judge-made doctrines were developed to "flush out" impermissible bases for regulatory decisions. The consequence is the modern hard-look doctrine, which rests on a deliberative conception of administration. Properly understood, the doctrine protects beneficiaries of regulation on the same terms as regulated class members. American presidents, too, have increasingly exerted control over the bureaucracy, most recently by delegating supervisory power to OMB. In addition, Congress has enacted judicially enforceable deadlines, "goals" statutes, and precise regulatory guidelines to ensure that agencies do not subvert regulatory statutes in the implementation process. The three branches of government have thus intruded on agency autonomy in ways that have restored some of the features of the original constitutional framework. 
The recent exercises of power by each branch of government reject the New Deal conception of administration. All have been highly controversial. Judicial control is said to substitute uninformed, unaccountable judges for technically expert and politically responsible administrators. Presidential power has generated sharp attack by critics who favor a New Deal model of autonomous administration. Congressional specificity is said to give rise to risks associated with factionalism and lack of technical competence. 
Simultaneous presidential, legislative, and judicial control can, however, be tied tightly both to the underlying goal of deliberative government and to the purposes of the original distribution of national powers. These controls can ensure that agency decisions take account of governing statutes, technical facts, and "politics," properly understood. It is a mistake to adopt a wholly technocratic or wholly political conception of administration. The deliberative approach outlined here maintains continuity with both the original framework and the New Deal, and accommodates political choice and technical specialization. A system of oversight by the constitutionally specified branches does not produce blind adherence to the status quo. By proliferating points of access to government, it may, on the contrary, increase the opportunities for groups to seek and obtain reform. 
The task for the future is to achieve some of the purposes underlying the distribution of powers without abandoning the understanding that the common law system of regulation is insufficient. This task has three components. At the national level, the goal is to promote Madisonian representation while furnishing safeguards against factionalism and self-interested representation. At the local level, the task is to promote diversity, participation, and self-government in such a way as to accomplish traditional republican goals, which are inadequately served either by modern state government or by the presidency.4 12 In terms of legal rights, the goal is to develop a set of entitlements that does not take the common law or the status quo as the baseline for decision. In this context, New Deal insights have been insufficiently incorporated into modern public law, which continues to rely on questionable understandings of "neutrality" and "inaction." 
All of these tasks are formidable ones. In particular, the notion of Madisonian representation has to some degree broken down in practice, 413 and the system of checks and balances is closely associated with fear of governmental "action" and acceptance of governmental "inaction." Devolution to the states must be selective, and must guard against elimination of regulatory safeguards that national institutions are uniquely able to furnish. Development of a system of legal rights that rejects status quo baselines is enormously difficult. 
Reforms of the sorts suggested here must be part of a far broader strategy for reconstruction of the constitutional system in light of developments occurring during and after the New Deal. It may not be too optimistic however, to suggest that we have put in place some of the structures with which to begin the task of integrating the growth of bureaucracy and the rejection of the common law into a system that seeks to diminish the risks of factional tyranny and self-interested representation.

JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION IN A CONSERVATIVE ERA* 
Cass R. Sunstein Richard K. Willard Alan B. Morrison 
DWARD J. GRENIER: My name is Ed Grenier, Chairman of the Section of Administrative Law. I'm very happy to welcome you today to this program. I think you will find it very interesting and stimulating, so I will get out of the way as quickly as possible and let it roll. 
We are privileged to have with us today as moderator of this program Professor Ronald Levin of the Washington University School of Law. He not only conceived this program but also was the chief architect of this report that I hope most of you have, which is a Restatement of Scope-of-Review Doctrine.' I must say Ron exhibited the patience of Job in getting this document through our Section Council. I think we spent at least seven or eight meetings on it. Frankly, I don't think it would be finished yet except for our Chairman last year, Bill Murane, who is here in the audience. He finally said, "We are finishing it at this meeting," and, by God, we finished it at that meeting. But here it is, and I think you'll find it extremely interesting and stimulating. We hope it will be read and looked at and debated by scholars, practitioners and interested citizens. 
Now, I will let Ron introduce the speakers, but I would like to introduce Ron himself. As I said, Ron is a Professor of Law at the Washington University School of Law. He received his J.D. at the *Editor's Note: This is the transcript of a panel discussion presented at the Fall Meeting of the Section of Administrative Law on October 10, 1986, at the International Club in Washington, D.C. 
'Levin, Scope-of-Review DoctrineRestated:An AdministrativeLaw Section Report, 38 AD. L. REV. 239 (1986). University of Chicago, where he was Article and Book Review Editor of the Law Review. I am also pleased to report, and I take this as a personal privilege, that my partners and I had the privilege of practicing law with Ron for a few years at Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan until he decided to go off to academia. It was a loss that we very much regretted, but now at least we can deal with Ron in a different relationship. 
Among his other employment activities, he was law clerk to the Honorable John Godbold, a Circuit Judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Among his numerous publications is one which I think is worthy of note because it has such a wonderful title and suggests what a very imaginative fellow Ron is. The title is "Administrative Discretion, Judicial Review, and the Gloomy World of Judge Smith."2 I don't know if Ron will try to explain that title, but it sounds very intriguing. 
Ron is going to be moderator of this panel session, but actually his marching orders are to be an active and involved moderator, almost a quasi-panelist. I have instructed him to go beyond the bounds of what an absolutely neutral moderator might do. I hope our panelists are forewarned. 
With that, I'd like to give you Ron Levin, who will introduce the rest of the panel. 
RONALD M. LEVIN: Thank you, Ed. There is good reason to believe that our program today will be able to contribute fresh ideas to the debate over judicial review, because, with one exception, all of the members of the panel, including myself, are in their thirties. I don't suppose Alan Morrison is used to having people regard him as one of the "grand old men of administrative law," but in this company that is a possibility. 
I will just mention the panelists and then introduce them more formally as we go along. Sitting closest to me is Richard Willard, Assistant Attorney General of the United States; next to him, Cass Sunstein, Professor of Law at the University of Chicago; beyond him is the aforementioned Alan Morrison, Director of the Public Citizen Litigation Group; and farthest from me, Judge Kenneth Starr of the D.C. Circuit. 
I'll stop and say a couple of words about the restatement report, which most of you have just received, because this program was designed in part to highlight the restatement project. Broadly speaking, the doctrines on scope of review can be divided into three categories. There are doctrines that are so well established that everybody knows them. There are doctrines that are fairly well established, but that not so many people know. And then there are doctrines that are so totally unsettled that nobody could possibly claim to "know" them. 
Concerning the first category, those that are very well established, our restatement project by hypothesis doesn't have new information to contribute. What we hope it does do is to put these doctrines into a systematic framework. It was our idea that somebody who was new to administrative law could pick up the restatement or blackletter portion-the three pages in front-and get an overview of the topic of judicial review. He could then move on from there to more arcane subjects if he needed to do so. 
As for the second area, doctrines that are somewhat established but are not widely known, one thing that we hope our restatement and report can do is to serve as a source of research and scholarship. We have explored some topics that are not covered anywhere else in the literature. To that extent, it's a source of citations and of guidance. 
Then finally we have areas that nobody can have a definitive word about. All we can hope to have done on that score is to state a contemporary view that a good number of administrative lawyers looked at and felt they could live with. 
The topics for today's discussion obviously fall into the third category. There is ample room for debate about both of the topics we have chosen for this session, and the panelists have promised to provide debate as well as disagreement on them. These topics focus around two recent cases-Chevron v. NRDC' and Heckler v. Chaney,4 both of which represent some indications that the Supreme Court is proposing to move the role of reviewing courts towards a more deferential stance than has been prevalent in the past. 
For the sake of topicality here, I'd like to mention a brief sequence from the new television show "L.A. Law," which premiered last week. Some of you may doubt that the show is relevant to our concerns this afternoon-but it is, because it opens with the death of a lawyer in the firm named Norman Chaney. As Mr. Chaney's corpse is being carried out of his office, a secretary can be heard in the background answering the telephone and saying, in the blandest possible voice, "Mr. Chaney is not available at the moment." And so it is with the question we are looking at today: is aggressivejudicial review dead--or only temporarily unavailable? 'Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837 (1984). 
'470 U.S. 821 (1985). 
Our format will be something like this: since we are fortunate enough to have four panelists who are experts on both of the topics before us today, everyone will be able to get into the act on both topics. We'll have two speakers to talk about Chevron, and then comments by the others and myself. Then we'll take a break and come back and do the same treatment for Heckler v. Chaney. 
I'd like to go on at this point to our coverage of Chevron. Deference to administrative agencies on issues of statutory construction has been an especially controversial area- in the last few years. Roughly since the advent of the Bumpers Amendment,' it has been a hot topic on the administrative law agenda. And Chevron, in the year and a half that it's been out, has been emerging as the leading case on the subject. This in itself is rather unusual. Until recently there was no such thing as a leading case in this specific area. But during the last Supreme Court term, whenever the Court had occasion to refer to the issue of deference to agencies on statutory issues, it almost invariably cited Chevron. That may be only lip service, but it does suggest that Chevron is a good place to start in trying to understand that issue. 
Our first speaker to talk about the case is Judge Kenneth Starr, who is a graduate of Duke Law School. He is a former clerk in the Fifth Circuit and on the Supreme Court for Chief Justice Burger. He practiced law here in Washington with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and then left his partnership to become Counselor to the Attorney General of the United States. Then he became ajudge for the District of Columbia Circuit, and tomorrow is the third anniversary of his accession to the bench. 
I understand that Judge Starr, before he even attended law school, worked at the State Department, and one of his main duties was to be a tour guide for foreign dignitaries who wanted to see the cities of the United States. So he is well qualified to lead us on a tour of the unfamiliar and mysterious landscape of judicial review. 
JUDGE KENNETH W. STARR: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be with you on a perfectly beautiful afternoon, to engage in this rather sobering task of analyzing one aspect of the relationship between agencies and courts. I will try not to make too many points. I'm very mindful of the fact thatjudges tend not to be particularly coherent, at least when they speak somewhat extemporaneously, as opposed to writing opinions. You will recall the story about Justice Frankfurter's wife, who was asked why the Justice's speeches were not being better received. Mrs. Frankfurter reflected for a moment and said, "Well, you see, Felix has two problems. The first is he always strays from the point, but the second and more fundamental one is that he always finds his way back." I will try to limit both the number of points and the amount of straying, as I lead you on this magical tour through judicial review in the post-Chevron era. 
Let me state a couple of basics on which I hope there will be some consensus. Some aspects of this ever-intriguing relationship between the Article 1I branch and the Article III branch are gradually becoming clearer. What springs to my mind is the framework for analysis of arbitrary-and-capricious-type challenges. At least we know what the standards are supposed to be, although we realize, of course, that the standards give enormous room forjudgment calls. An easy example is the question of whether the agency has adequately explicated the basis for its substantive action. It raises that wonderful problem, as Judge Leventhal put it so well in 1970, of drawing the line between the "tolerably terse" and "intolerably mute."" We know, however, that that's the issue that we have to deal with. Was the agency tolerably terse, or was it intolerably mute? The standard, the framework is quite clear. 
Oddly enough, that seems not to be true in this fundamental area of which Professor Levin spoke, the interpretation of statutes. Historically, it seems to me, courts used various modes or approaches when they dealt with a statute which lay in the province of an administrative agency. One was the deference mode. The courts, in acts of humility, looked to see whether the agency had in fact construed the statute which it was charged with administering. If it had, and if the construction was consistent, and especially if it was roughly contemporaneous with the enactment of the statute, then the courts would accept that construction of the statute unless there were "compelling reasons" (the words of such cases as Red Lion 7) not to accept it. Those reasons, like compelling state interests in constitutional law, were relatively rare. 
Another traditional mode was the full-blown, rigorous, judicial interpretation approach, regardless of the agency's views of the statute. The judiciary did not need any help, for example, from the expert agency in divining the meaning of the word "wages," even though the word had been the subject of a construction by the Social Security Administration (then Board) in the Nierotko case.' We don't need to know what the agency's views are, the Supreme Court said. We are a court, we can wrestle with the word "wages." So, too, in certain legislative gap-filling functions, the courts were rather jealous in guarding their prerogatives. The views of an expert agency, the courts held, were utterly irrelevant to the question whether there was an implied private cause of action under a statute.' We didn't care what the agency said. We would make that judgment call ourselves. 
Yet another traditional approach was one that was purposive, if you will, in its inquiry. The court, in confronting a statute, particularly against an agency's reading of a statute, would examine whether that interpretation was promotive of what the court deemed to be Congress's purposes. If it was not, then another reasonable interpretation of the statute, which was promotive-or was more promotive-of the divined congressional purpose, would be accepted by the courts. 
This last approach was that which gave rise, as I see it, to Chevron,"'a case which all appellate judges these days bear firmly in mind in reading statutes. It was decided, of course, just two years ago, but it is very frequently invoked, notjust by the Supreme Court, but by inferior tribunals trying to do their best at interpreting statutes. Chevron was, as you know, the "bubble" case. The issue, very simply stated, was the meaning of the statutory term "stationary source" as found in the Clean Air Act. The battle was over whether a source was an individual piece of equipment, on the one hand, or the entire plant (encapsulated, as it were, in a bubble), on the other. 
Upon review, our court found that the term "stationary source" had nowhere been defined by the Congress and the legislative history was conflicting. "[A]t best contradictory" were the words of the court." So, since Congress was unclear, our court, using the traditional tools of interpreting statutes, felt at liberty to provide its own interpretation. After all, that's what courts do day in and day out-we read statutes. In this case, the D.C. Circuit concluded that the purposes of the statute should guide the decision. We found that, while the bubble concept was mandatory for certain Clean Air Act purposes, when designed merely to maintain existing air quality, the concept was inappropriate when applied to programs designed to enhance or improve air quality, as in Chevron itself. The regulation of the Administrator was thus deemed incompatible with these fundamental purposes of the Act. 
This approach seems rather sensible. It certainly seems to be trying to vindicate Congress's general intent. It was not a vague set of purposes that was being relied upon, or a mechanical invocation of the 'Piper v. Chris-Craft Indus., Inc., 430 U.S. 1, 41 n.27 (1977). 1-467 U.S. 837 (1984). "NRDC v. Gorsuch, 685 F.2d 718, 726 n.39 (D.C. Cir. 1982). notion that environmental legislation is remedial in nature and thus must be generously interpreted. Not at all. 
I think, upon reading what the lower court did in Chevron-I was not on the panel-that it engaged in a thorough, lawyer-like analysis of the entirety of the statute. And it was an effort analogous, it seems to me, to what federal courts have to do in diversity cases every day-divine what a state court might do if confronted with this particular issue. To make a reasoned judgment, with respect and with restraint, about what the statute would have said if the question had been put directly to the Congress. This approach, whatever its demerits, at least embodied a good faith attempt to vindicate legislative supremacy. It certainly was not, if I may use the term, an "activist" decision. It was not the imperial judiciary riding roughshod over the agencies, as we were authoritatively convicted of doing in Vermont Yankee." The court in a very painstaking opinion was seeking, I believe, to follow the law as Congress had laid it down. There was frank recognition of the fact that (legislative compromises and the dynamics of the legislative process aside) Congress will invariably fail adequately to anticipate and address each serious question likely to arise in a statute's administration. 
But the Supreme Court was unmoved by our efforts. It did recanvass the statute. It did recanvass the structure and the legislative history. And it didn't disagree with us on what I'm going to call Chevron Step One. But it said that we had guessed wrong, or rather that we shouldn't be guessing at all, about what Congress "would have done." We had been a bit rude, as it were. We had ignored a guest sitting at the dinner table. We had been talking to the lawyer representing this guest from the Justice Department, but we had not paid adequate attention to what our distinguished guest, the Administrator of EPA, had herself said on the subject. So in this unanimous opinion for a bobtailed Court, Justice Stevens began by chastising the court of appeals For a basic mistake. 
Now, this is odd. This is like Law 101. You would think our court would know how to go about the process of reading a statute. But our mistake was that we had misconceived the very nature of the judicial role in reviewing the bubble regulation. Once our court had determined that Congress did not actually have an intent regarding the applicability of the bubble program, the Supreme Court instructed us, our inquiry should have been whether the Administrator's view that it was appropriate, in the context of this particular program, was a "permissible" one (a term which, as you know, the Court proceeded to '2Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519 (1978). use interchangeably with the term "reasonable"). Thus was born-or "re-announced," for those who believe that Chevron signaled no change whatsoever in the way we go about our business-the "Chevron twostep." It is a straightforward, I believe clear, analytical framework. We now know how to do it. 
Step One is to find out Congress's intent. This isn't intent writ large, mind you, such as a cleaner environment or a safer working place. It is specific intent, if you will. The Court, in Justice Stevens' words, is to determine whether Congress has "directly spoken to the precise question at issue."'" Now that is obviously a narrow, exacting test, putting quite an onus on the courts and, of course, ultimately on the Congress to legislate with considerable specificity. I find that the crafting of language on which three people can agree is difficult enough, even when those people are reasonable people who sit down with a common goal in mind. Congress, of course, sits and legislates en banc with 535 members of the tribunal. Even when Congress sits in panels, its committees, those panels exceed our much more manageable number of three. So the sheer challenge of draftsmanship in a political environment is daunting enough, but to couple that with prescience as to how the statute will in fact play out, will come alive in the regulatory setting, is asking quite a bit. 
So we move to the second part of the Chevron two-step. In cases where Congress's specific intent is not clear, then the question before the court is to look at what our special guest sitting at the table, the Administrator, has said, and to make ajudgment as to whether that is reasonable. As I say, the Court in Chevron agreed with our analysis of what we now know to be Chevron Step One. Congress had not, through the statute and its legislative history and structure, spoken to the precise question at hand. The Administrator's bubble approach, while not the only approach, was nonetheless permissible and reasonable, the Court concluded. 
I think it's instructive to look at why the Court concluded that the Administrator's interpretation passed Step Two. The Administrator had, in fact, indicated that the non-bubble, individualized approach could actually retard programs. It would be counterproductive not to employ the bubble approach. Certain plausible management efficiency advantages were advanced, such as reducing confusion and inconsistency, those twin evils that infect seemingly every regulatory program. 
Chevron thus established the analytic framework for judicial review "Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842. and interpretation of statutes. Not everyone has caught on to this fact. We continue to see in filings in our court a lot of Red Lion and Udall v. Tallman'4-type language suggesting that we simply look to the agency's reading-as with the old saw, "when the legislative history is in doubt, go to the statute." They say, let's start with what the agency did. On the other hand, we see language suggesting that we need not pay any attention at all to the guest seated at our right. After all, it was no lesser light than John Marshall who said, and we see this a lot, "It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.' 5 However Olympian that sentiment may be, it seems not to capture entirely the spirit ofjudges' work in the modern administrative era. ChiefJustice Marshall had before him the Constitution and a set of statutes to construe. He was spared such delicious contemporary morsels as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended in 1978, 1980 and 1984. John Marshall was not required to face the Internal Revenue Code, much less CERCLA and RCRA. 
In the two terms since Chevron came down, if my count is right, Chevronhas been employed with regularity, and in all cases save one the agency won the case. In the Chemical Manufacturers case,' involving EPA's interpretation of a specific term, the issue was the meaning of the word "modified" as found in a particular provision of the Clean Water Act. The Court was sharply divided, losing the unanimity it had enjoyed in Chevron. FiveJustices concluded that the word "modify" was ambiguous under Step One and moved on to Step Two, upholding the agency on what I think were Chevron-type grounds of regulatory management efficiency. It makes sense to do it that way. Four Justices, while making very clear that they agreed with the Chevron analytic approach, wanted to stop at Phase One of the Chevron two-step. The word "modify," they thought, under these specific circumstances was quite clear and thus the Administrator could not lawfully grant the so-called FDF variances. 
In Riverside Bayview,"7 the agency won unanimously under it Step Two analysis. The Corps of Engineers was regulating activities on wetlands which a builder had development designs on. The specific question was whether the statutory term "navigable waters"-which Congress had helpfully defined as "the waters of the United States"14380 U.S. 1, 16-18 (1965). '5Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803). 6Chemical Mfrs. Ass'n v. NRDC, 470 U.S. 116 (1985). '"United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121 (1985). included wetlands. One might think, as did the developer and the inferior court in that case, that wetlands, which after all were lands, were not "navigable waters." But of course one would be wrong, as the Court pointed out in a very thorough and careful opinion. 
One should not despair, however. The Court really does not think that Congress is institutionally incapable of having specific intent, scienter, if you will, as opposed to a Rousseauian general will. For in the "non-bank bank" case, Dimension Financial8," the Court came down unanimously, as you know, against the agency. The Fed would not be permitted to assert jurisdiction over these newcomers to the financial services scene. The Court held the Fed to a rather strict reading of the statutory definition of "bank" as found in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. Custom and practice would not do, nor would so-called substitutes for commercial loans do. The statute was, in the retired Chief Justice's words, "clear and unambiguous," a conclusion that I note has been sharply attacked in some of the trade press.' 
One is thus brought to wonder if there can be, other than in banking regulation, a clear and unambiguous statute. Is the world really filled with "quiche" that is subject to regulation by Judge Winter's National Quiche Commission, even though the NQC is regulating what all of us, outside of administrative law at least, would think of as pizzas and frisbees? 0 After all, no lesser light than ChiefJustice Hughes found the term "foreign country" to be inherently ambiguous." And in a relativistic age where one still hears an occasional jeremiad against cultural imperialism, whatever that is, perhaps nothing does have clear meaning other than the word "bank." 
"Modify" is ambiguous. So is "waters of the United States" ambiguous, and so is "stationary source," and so from a half-century ago is "foreign country." So, too, although in a different way, the Court ten years ago found the word "unemployment" in Batterton v. Francis2" to be ambiguous. We certainly know from a case close to my heart, Young v. Community Nutrition Institute, 3 that it does not take much to make for ambiguity. Even statutes which the Court says have a "more natural reading" may, in fact, be infected with that modern universal disease of ambiguity. Ambiguity seems to have taken on epidemic proportions. 8Board of Govs. v. Dimension Fin. Corp., 474 U.S. 361 (1986). 
"gFein, Agency DiscretionUnwisely Limited in 'Dimension', LEGAL TIMES, Feb. 10, 1986, at 10. 
"Winter, The Quiche Brief, REGULATION, Sept./Oct. 1986, at 31. "Burnet v. Chicago Portrait Co., 285 U.S. 1, 5 (1932). 22432 U.S. 416 (1977). 2 106 S. Ct. 2360 (1986), revg 757 F.2d 354 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (Starr, J.). This century has not been kind to those of us who rather curiously and quaintly think that there is such a thing as plain meaning or normal meaning, even though it is at times trotted out and employed in the jurisprudence from the High Court. But as an optimist I refuse to succumb to the cynicism that might infect some portions of the academy (other than those inhabited by my former colleague from the fifth floor of the Justice Department, Professor Sunstein, from whom you're about to hear). 
The reason that I am not pessimistic is that Step One, I believe, is a real test with real teeth and in fact can reasonably be argued to vindicate an appropriate judicial role. My court, with a panel of Judges Silberman, Buckley and yours truly having the honor of writing, held not so many days ago that the ICC's interpretation of a particular statute ran afoul of Step One, in a case of some interest involving Norfolk Southern's acquisition of North American Van Lines and about which there seems to be some legislative interest. 4 And, as I say, in Dimension Financial the Supreme Court unanimously invalidated agency action under Step One and in Chemical Manufacturers four Justices voted to overturn EPA's reading under Step One. 
So I offer quickly, for what it's worth, one rather general observation from my reading of these cases: If the question seems to the Court to reduce to one of managerial judgment, if you will, or regulatory judgment, the Supreme Court may very well move on to Step Two. That seems to me to be a theme common to Chevron and Chemical Manufacturers.Both cases could reasonably be seen as issues of regulatory management. "It's complex," says the agency, "and we're trying to muddle through, and here is the basis for our effort at muddling through." It seems to me we're not going to see as much deference in cases going to the very heart, the core, of the agency's power, which was of course the case in Dimension Financial,or as would be the case in our hypothetical National Quiche Commission trying to regulate donuts. Compared to questions of managerial judgment, Congress at least speaks, if you will, when it shapes a grant of power. Perhaps what we're reading in the cases is a sense that Congress is at least trying to speak with as much specificity as it can when it grants power. 
But this is no grand theory by any means, for in such cases as Haigv. Agee15 and CIA v. Sims,"6 which Mr. Willard successfully argued in the Supreme Court, the Court emphasized the sheer breadth of the grant of power, as in a way presumptively validating the agency's view of its 2 1 nternational Bhd. of Teansters v. ICC, 801 F.2d 1423 (D.C. Cir. 1986). 25453 U.S. 280 (1981). 26471 U.S. 159 (1985). own power, even if that view did not find a clear "textually demonstrable basis," to paraphrase Baker v. Carr2.7 We need not move into what might be viewed as the sui generis field of foreign affairs and national security to find nonspecificity in a grant of power. We need only recall our wetlands case and our frustrated developer, where "navigable waters" was defined as "waters of the United States." In that case, Riverside Bayview, the Court conducted what can be fairly viewed as a thoroughgoing and rigorous and lawyerlike analysis. It demonstrated, although reasonable minds can differ, I suppose, that Congress had in at least one part of that statute expressly conferred jurisdiction on the Corps of Engineers with respect to wetlands. 
A second observation is that the courts have tended to look at the general intent of Congress in deciding how vigorously to scrutinize the agency's interpretation. If it seems apparent that Congress intended a very broad grant of power, then the courts may prove to be more deferential in examining the agency's definitional handiwork. If Congress says, in essence, "here is a problem, go solve it, but do so with limited resources," then Congress may very well have expressly delegated definitional or interpretative power. 
We saw this in Batterton v. Francis,where the Court took a rather hands-off approach in scrutinizing the term "unemployment." Now, "unemployment" seems more akin to the term "wages" in Nierotko than it does to a complex term like "stationary source," which was at issue in Chevron; thus, one might expect a fuller blown, less deferential approach in construing a key term. But the Court concluded that Congress's intent was to delegate very broad powers to the Secretary of HEW to craft a comprehensive welfare scheme. The Court in that case seemed to appreciate the seamless web nature of the administrative enterprise. One could not ignore the fact that Congress's intent was for the Secretary to go ahead and construct an entire system. As in systems analysis, all parts of the system interact, and judicial nitpicking at certain strategic points in the system might well have untoward and counterproductive consequences, if not windfall consequences, for certain beneficiaries of an entire regime-even though the courts' intervention might arrive cloaked in the guise of vindicating the broad, remedial, compassionate purposes that had animated Congress in the first instance to create an AFDC-type scheme. The courts, to put it crassly, might, by donning their Olympian Marburyv. Madison robes, be unwanted do-gooders gumming up the works out of the most laudable motives. 
All of this brings me finally to some observations about Step One of Chevron. Step One, needless to say, raises some rather difficult questions of interpretation for thejudiciary. The first is one I have alluded to already at somewhat untoward length: what force do words themselves have? If we are all too sophisticated these days to embrace the plain meaning rule-of which some of us are fond-where do we go without it? Could we repair to a normal meaning rule? Even Frankfurter, the modernist skeptic, believed that ordinary statutes are in fact addressed to ordinary men and women, and thus should bear the ordinary reading of everyday life. 8 
The second is the use of legislative history. The Supreme Court gives us mixed signals as to its appropriateness. It is appropriate at times; it seems not to be appropriate at other times. At times when it seems to be inappropriate, where the statute is clear and unambiguous, nonetheless the courts will check the legislative history to make sure that there is no ambiguity to be put into the statutory language itself from the legislative history. Our own court of late, in such cases as Abourezk"' and now-Justice Scalia's concurring opinion in Hirschey v. FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission," have cast some considerable doubt on the value of legislative history. There seems to be at least some sentiment that the old and pure English rule may be better, both in attorneys' fees and in the reading of statutes. 
The third is in doctrines like legislative acquiescence, employed in such decisions in this decade as Haigv. Agee and BobJones.' One might think it's as odd a way to make law as is legislative history. Is this indeed a legitimate source for discerning Congress's intent? It is one thing to pass a statute in the face of clear, consistent administrative interpretations that are known to Congress as a whole, as opposed to an oversight committee. It seems another for Congress simply to have been informed of an administrative interpretation, and taken no action of any sort. The Court, as in the wetlands case, will sometimes say it is chary of' attributing too much significance to situations of the latter sort; but nonetheless, as I say, we see that doctrines like legislative acquiescence live on. 
It would seem that the failure to enact a statute should have about the same probative value as a decision not to take enforcement action. Congress, like enforcement agencies (to foreshadow a bit of our discussion to come), has scarce resources. It might even be counting on the 2 Addison v. Holly Hill Fruit Prods., Inc., 322 U.S. 607, 618 (1944). 
2 Abourezk v. Reagan, 785 F.2d 1043, 1054 n. 11 (D.C. Cir.), cert.granted, 107 S.Ct. 666 (1986) (No. 86-656). 
30777 F.2d 1, 7-8 & n.I (D.C. Cir. 1985) (Scalia, J., concurring). 3'Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 600-02 (1983). courts, when the interpretation of the agency mandate gives rise to an actual case or controversy, to vindicate Congress's original intent, as it were. Plus, the whole notion or doctrine of acquiescence raises difficult questions of subsequent Congresses giving definition to what an earlier Congress, gone out of existence, had done. 
I will conclude by saying that I think we are in relatively uncharted territory, because very little law has been made, with respect to Chevron Step Two. When is an agency's interpretation reasonable when the statute is in fact infected with ambiguity? There's precious little law out of our Circuit. And, at least at this stage, as I count it, not a singlejustice has, in Chevron or since, cast a vote against the agency under Chevron Step Two. 
Thank you for your very kind patience. 
PROF. LEVIN: There are those who suspect that the reason I wanted Cass Sunstein to be on this panel today was that I wanted at least one panelist who would be younger than myself. That wasn't my reason, but if I had had some such plan in mind, he would have been an obvious choice. During the past five years, while he's been on the faculty of the University of Chicago Law School, he has written (by my count from his resume) 27 articles in the fields of administrative law and constitutional law. And, lest you think that quality is going out the window for the sake of quantity: when I invited Cass to be here with us today, I didn't realize he was coming to our Section of Administrative Law meeting anyway-to receive our Section's first Annual Award for Administrative Law Scholarship. It will be presented to him for a recent article of his in the StanfordLaw Review,3 2 a very interesting blend of administrative law, constitutional law, and constitutional history. 
Before joining the Chicago faculty, Cass graduated from Harvard Law School, clerked on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and the U.S. Supreme Court, and also worked in the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice. At present, though affiliated with Chicago, he's a visiting professor at Columbia Law School. 
CASs R. SUNSTEIN: Thank you very much, Ron, and all of you. 
Perhaps because of my different institutional position, I am less of an enthusiast for the Chevron decision than is Judge Starr. The problem, as I see it, is that the decision threatens, first, to confuse rather than clarify the law governing judicial deference to statutory interpretation by administrative agencies. Second, and more fundamentally, I think the case threatens to undermine rather than promote separation of powers principles that have been with us for a long time. "Sunstein, Interest Groups in American Public Law, 38 STAN. L. REV. 29 (1985). 
The discussion will come in three parts. I will begin by pointing to a definitional ambiguity in the Chevron decision, which is critical to its reach and importance. Second, I will discuss what's wrong with a "strong" reading of Chevron, a reading that I thinkJudge Starr does not approve of. Third, I'll make some criticisms of the understanding of Chevron that Judge Starr has set out, and try to suggest an alternative position about how courts should approach administrative interpretation of statutes. 
Chevron says, as Judge Starr points out, that there is a distinction between two possible situations. In the first, Congress "has directly addressed the precise question at issue."3 That isJudge Starr's Chevron Part One. Part Two is when Congress hasn't addressed the precise question at issue. When that happens, says the Chevron Court, the general rule ought to be one of deference. The definitional ambiguity in Chevron has to do with the reach of those two categories. Note that Category One is one as to which courts are not supposed to be terribly deferential. In examining those questions, the court can look independently. But if Congress hasn't "directly addressed the precise issue," then there is to be considerable deference to the agency interpretation. 
One could read Chevron in one of two ways. Let's call the first one a "strong" reading of Chevron. This one you can see in several recent Supreme Court decisions. The strong reading goes, basically: Chevron proclaims a rule of judicial deference to administrative interpretation of statutes. That reading fits comfortably with the language of Chevron. The reason? Well, as Judge Starr points out, statutes are very generally ambiguous. That's what generates lawsuits. If in the face of statutory ambiguity the rule is one of deference, then what Chevron means essentially is a posture of judicial deference. 
A second, "weak" reading of Chevron would emphasize that the case recognizes the existence of a large area in which Congress has "directly addressed precise questions." In that large area, courts should play an independent role. Judge Starr's reading of the Chevron decision is this weaker reading, which allows more in the way ofjudicial independence in reviewing statutes. That one bothers me less. But let me begin by talking about the strong reading of Chevron. Again, the strong reading is that courts should defer generally to administrative interpretations of statutes because generally there will be ambiguity. When there's ambiguity, Congress hasn't directly addressed the precise question at issue. Herewith some criticisms of Chevron as thus understood. 
The first criticism comes from Marbury v. Madison. Courts, not ad"3Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842. ministrative agencies, are supposed to say what the law is. This principle is a very familiar one. The idea is that those who are limited in their authority by law should not be thejudge of those limits. Administrative agencies are constrained by statute, that is, law, and the mere fact that the statute is ambiguous shouldn't give the agency, of all people, the authority to decide on the meaning of the limitation. The cute way in which it's sometimes put is that foxes shouldn't guard henhouses. If Chevron is taken to mean that agencies judge the scope of their own authority, then one has precisely that problem. 
The second criticism is that Chevron is too crude and undifferentiated in its strong version. The category of "agencies interpreting law" captures a wide territory. Most important, there's a difference between pure questions of law, questions that turn only on the meaning of statutes, and mixed questions of law and fact, as to which agency expertise is far more relevant. In deciding whether the Occupational Safety and Health statute is a feasibility statute or a cost-benefit statute3 4-that one calls purely for lawyers' competence. What does the statute mean? Administrative agencies' fact-finding competence is not relevant. If the question, on the other hand, is whether benzene poses a significant risk within the meaning of a statute,3 agency fact-finding expertise is relevant. Chevron collapses this critical distinction between pure questions of law on the one hand and mixed questions on the other. 
Criticism number three is that Chevron, understood in this strong version, is inconsistent with Congress's own hopes and expectations. One has to understand that the Administrative Procedure Act enacted, incidentally, by conservatives-was designed to limit administrative agency authority and, in the words of Justice Frankfurter, to express a "mood" calling for strongerjudicial control of administrative action. 7 The Administrative Procedure Act, the basic charter governing judicial review of agency action, can hardly be understood as a proclamation in favor of judicial deference to administrative agency interpretations of law. If there's any evidence of congressional views in the meantime, those views are very much in accord with the original spirit of the Administrative Procedure Act, that is, that administrative agency interpretations of law should not be deferred to. 
Criticism number four is that this emphasis on "directly deciding precise questions at issue" misconceives statutory construction. Statutory construction is not a search for direct decision of precise questions. It's much more complicated than that. Congress often doesn't foresee how its laws will be applied or what the particular circumstances will be. Statutes are designed, and here's the key point, to guide the exercise of discretion in unforeseen cases. One can, and courts do, extrapolate from statutes principles that constrain the exercise of administrative authority even in circumstances about which Congress has thought not at all. 
Here's criticism number five, and the final one, of this strong understanding of Chevron. One point that Chevron misses, and this is critical, is the uneasy constitutional position of the administrative agency. Administrative agencies pose all of the problems that have produced a judicial review section of the APA precisely because they are only indirectly accountable. They are not directly accountable to the President (though President Reagan, I think fortunately, has taken steps in that direction), nor are they accountable directly to the Congress. They are subject to institutional pressures and occupational hazards which make their decisionmaking flawed in ways that aren't implicated when the decisionmaker is the President or the Congress. All that is to suggest that the uneasy constitutional position of the administrative agency justifies an aggressive judicial role, above all in interpreting administrative agency understandings of law. This is an understanding which Congress shares. 
That set of criticisms persuades me at least that Chevron, understood in its strong version, as a plea for judicial deference in the face of ambiguity, is a mistake. One should hope and expect the Court to recede from it in the future. There is a little sign in this direction from Justice Stevens, the author of Chevron itself. In dissenting from a Supreme Court decision that overruled, wrongly in my view, a decision of the District of Columbia Circuit penned by a judge who shall go unmentioned, Justice Stevens said that the role of the reviewing court is not to manufacture ambiguity and then to defer." This was written by the author of Chevron. 
Okay. I have suggested that if Chevron is taken, and there are signs that it's being taken, as a plea for judicial deference to administrative interpretations of law, it's a big mistake. Judge Starr's reading is a weaker reading, and I want to make a few milder criticisms of that position. 
First, here's how I think the Court should deal with this problem. This isn't made up out of the blue; it captures widespread practices by "Young v. Community Nutrition Inst., 106 S.Ct. at 2368 (Stevens, j., dissenting). courts before Chevron, the best of the Supreme Court practices and D.C. Circuit practices before Chevron. It goes as follows: You have pure questions of law, and you have mixed questions. You have questions which call for legal skills strictly, and you have questions that call for administrative skills as well. The administrative skills are applicable when the relevant question turns notjust on the statute and its history but turns also on an assessment of the facts. Whether benzene causes a statutory "significant risk" is an example. The basic line which the best courts I think adopted before Chevron involved looking at that issue: Is it a pure question of law or is it a mixed question of law and fact? That's the line by which you decide how much deference to offer. 
I prefer that approach to the weak version of Chevron for a few reasons. Let me remind you what the weak version is. The weak version is that we have two categories, one in which Congress has directly decided precise questions, and one in which it has not. If Congress has directly decided precise questions, no deference is due, and we will take that possibility seriously. But not directly deciding precise questions is also possible, and in that context the administrative agency likely wins. 
The first problem with that interpretation is this: If it means that in the face of ambiguity, administrative agencies win so long as their view is plausible, it seems to me vulnerable to most of the objections I've set out already. If there is ambiguity, the agency ought not automatically to win. The question, insofar as it's a pure question of law, is forjudicial rather than administrative determination. Ambiguities in statutes should not be resolved favorably to administrative agencies in every case. 
The second objection is that the notion that the question is "whether Congress is directly deciding precise questions or not" seems to me an incorrect way to understand statutory interpretation. The issue instead is, what does the statute mean? Often statutes will have meanings that constrain administrative agency behavior even in cases in which Congress hasn't directly decided precise questions at issue. This criticism drops out if the notion of directly deciding precise questions can be translated into the question, what does the statute mean? If that's what Chevron is about, then I'm satisfied. But I think this opposition between Chevron One and Chevron Two, which Judge Starr rightly points to in the opinion, is highly artificial. 
My third criticism, and I think this is the most important one, goes as follows. What Chevron represents in this weak reading version, which I much prefer to the strong reading, is a familiar confusion. It confuses the scope of review with the merits. Here's why that is so. 
Administrative agencies will often win, even on a pure question of law, when Congress in the statute has not said anything relevant to the issue. What the Court should have said in Chevron, I think (and the case was rightly decided), was that Congress hasn't forbidden this administrative action. That's not a principle of deference, or a thumb on the scales in favor of the agency, that's straightforward statutory construction, under my framework of pure questions of law versus mixed questions. Agencies will often win on both pure questions of law and mixed questions for a very simple reason: often statutes do not constrain administrative behavior. To collapse the notion of deference and the agency's winning, as Chevron, I think, does, is to collapse scope of review and the merits. They are two separate issues. That's why to me it makes more sense to do what the Supreme Court did in a number of cases, including the Hearst case,3" which is to distinguish between the pure question of law and the mixed question of law and fact. 
Okay. Let me conclude. What Chevron threatens to do, with either a strong reading or a weak reading, is to undermine some separation of powers principles that have been around for a long time. The basic notion that courts rather than agencies interpret law is not unobjectionable. It's filled with possibilities for errors. The courts make occasional mistakes. Nonetheless, that principle is built into the constitutional structure and is basically sound. Courts rather than agencies should be the interpreters of law. Courts have institutional advantages. That principle is, to some degree at least, threatened by the Chevron decision. That's why for me the case is a reason for concern rather than approval. 
Thank you. 
PROF. LEVIN: We're now going to have some briefer comments on the presentations we've just heard from our other two speakers. The first of them is Richard Willard, who graduated from Harvard in 1973, clerked on the Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court, then worked at Baker & Botts in Houston before joining the Justice Department. He has been for the last five years at the top of the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, first as Deputy Assistant Attorney General, then Acting Assistant Attorney General, and now as the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Division-which, of course, is the division in which the government presents its positions on the very issues we are discussing today. 
I trust that we will get the government's view, at least in short compass, right now from Mr. Willard. 
"3NLRB v. Hearst Publications, Inc., 322 U.S. 111, 131 (1944). construction, which we have been calling Step One. After that, what happens is application or use of discretion, which, of course, is reviewed deferentially. It doesn't help to try to break the process of statutory interpretation up more finely than that. 
Given that there's only one statutory construction step, I have a further critique of the language of Chevron, at least as it is being understood in somejudicial quarters. The exact language that Chevron uses is that the inquiry is whether Congress has "directly addressed the precise question at issue."48 It is being interpreted to mean that the inquiry is whether Congress has addressed the narrowquestion at issue. In other words: has Congress talked about the bubble (or whatever the factual situation might be)? No? Then on to Step Two. 
But the Court's language is whether Congress has addressed the precisequestion at issue. Sometimes the precise question framed by the parties can be a fairly broad question, one that requires identifying the broad purposes or the analytical framework that the statute contemplates. Questions don't just come out of nowhere; they come because parties present them to the court. And if the parties tender a broad question of that kind, then that question is one that the court has the expertise and responsibility to decide. That is how I would read Chevron, and how I think it was intended to be read. And so cases like Benzene49 and Cotton Dust,"° I think, are still valid, because it is for the court to determine questions like whether "feasibility" means costbenefit or the maximum that the industry can stand, and whether a "significant risk" must be shown in order for OSHA to regulate. This is carried forward in some cases during the past term as well, and I think remains the law. 
My point can easily be illustrated a little further if we look at a slight variation on the Chevron facts. Suppose that EPA had adopted the same bubble policy, saying, "We're adopting this policy because it's very important to reduce burdens on industry," and saying absolutely nothing else. It would still be true, if that case were to come up for review, that Congress would not have addressed the narrow question at issue. And yet it seems equally clear to me that the Court would reverse, because the account given by the agency would have neglected one of the policies that the Court found Congress had intended for the agency to consider, namely whether the interest in environmental protection outweighed the interest in relaxing the burden on industry. 
As long as we understand Chevron the way it's written and not the way 18467 U.S. at 843. 1 Industrial Union Dep't, AFL-CIO v. American PetrolemlInst, 448 U.S. 607 (1980). 5'American Textile Mfrs. Inst. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490 (1981). it is sometimes depicted, and we simply ask the court to decide any question of legislative intent that is framed by the parties, I think it's a much less troublesome opinion and one that fits current law much better. 
Finally, and I won't drag this out too much longer, the question is how much deference the agency gets in that determination. 
My basic notion here, which I think has been mentioned by Alan Morrison as well, is that you can't answer this question by looking at only one opinion. Usually when the Supreme Court speaks, it settles the law in the particular area it's talking about, because its decision is the only precedent in that field. But in the area of deference to agency constructions, the Court hands down some two dozen opinions a year. I think you get a much better sense of where the Court is going by looking at the broad picture than by trying to take one opinion and assume it states the only truth. Now, at one pole, you have a Young v. Community Nutrition which does manifest an enormous apparent degree of deference. On the other hand, just during the past term we have the DimensionFinancialcase which has been mentioned before, the nonbank banking case. We have a case called Louisiana Public Service Commission v. FCC5' which reversed an agency on a pure construction issue. We have a tax case called Hughes Properties51 in which the Court overturned the IRS's interpretation of a regulation, although agencies' constructions of their regulations have often been thought to command even more deference than their constructions of statutes. 
I am suggesting that if you look at opinions at large, you don't see quite as much deference as you might expect by looking at either Community Nutrition or Chevron by itself. 
Now, I hear you ask: "How can I, with my busy practice, manage to look at all those cases and get some sense of the broad picture?" Well-you can't. But an effort was made to synthesize the cases in the orange volume before you.53 I will note for what it's worth that, although there was much protest about an early draft of this section of the report 4 from various agency counsel who saw it, the version that you now have before you met with resistance from none of the administrative lawyers who reviewed it. So there is at least some slight indication that the report reflects a consensus view on how much deference an agency can be expected to get. JUDGE STARR: I already have my copy, incidentally. It's very useful. 
I'd like to respond very briefly to a couple of points. There's one which Alan made with respect to the third danger signal, which is "when the purpose of the statute is being subverted." I do think that Chevron itself, fairly read, as well as its progeny, comfortably permits that in Step Two. It seems to me that one of the first things that the court does in fact note in its Step Two consideration is whether the action being taken is indeed antithetical to the thrust of what Congress was trying to achieve-its meta-intent, to use Professor Sunstein's word. 
The other thing is that mention has been made of one of my favorite cases, Young v. Community Nutrition. I will simply say that I think Young, dispassionately viewed, is again a case of managerial muddling through. The agency had a very difficult job on its hands. While the statute might more naturally be read in one direction, it does not seem as if the agency was dong anything other than trying to go about its job of administering and managing in a very difficult area. It would gum up the works if a very literal, fundamentalist reading of the statute, as the learned court of appeals would have adopted, in fact obtained. 
Looking at it in the spirit of Professor Levin's comments, let's examine what has transpired since Chevron. I do think that managerial muddling through is a principal theme. When there is the second danger signal that Alan sees, namely the aggrandizing of power, the Court does in fact seem to put on its high phase, if you will, and read the statute much more carefully. Perhaps it would be better, in the spirit of Marvin Frankel, 55 if we were all more candid about what we are doing. 
PROF. SUNSTEIN: Just very briefly, a historical point. On the plane I was readingJames Landis's The Administrative Process,"6 which really was a kind of theoretical foundation of the administrative state. This is a very liberal book, and it was all pro-agency and anti-court. It's important to keep in mind that there is only a contingent historical association between the current deference to administrative agencies and conservatism. And opposing deference to administrative agencies and being liberal is a contingent position. The institutionaljudgment ought to be decided, I think, on some ground other than the political one. 
I think that view is shared by all of us here. 
The second point-I think the managerial judgment point made by Judge Starr is a nice one, and I hope it represents the direction in which 55M. FRANKEL, The Adversary judge, in PARTISAN JUSTICE 39 (1980). "6J. LANDIS, THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS (1938). the lower courts and the Supreme Court are going. It may, in fact. The reason I like it so much is that the distinction of managerial judgment versus pure law runs up nicely with my distinction between the pure question of law, where Marbury v. Madison kicks in, and the issues where administrative institutional competence is highly relevant. That may be Chevron itself. To me it is Chevron itself. To me it's not Young; I continue to believe the lower court decision there was correct. 
A third and final point. Mr. Willard said, and this is really a disagreement between us, that there is no reason to believe courts are better than administrative agencies at deciding questions of law, and that Marbury v. Madison is misread when it's understood to stand for the position that there is distinctive judicial competence in lawmaking. That is a big disagreement. Federalist No. 78, Hamilton's defense of judicial review, makes the point that foxes shouldn't guard henhouses. It isn't simply a matter of saying that, in the context of cases, courts do what they do. The point is that limitations on the scope of legal authority should not be decided by those who are subject to the limitations. Of course it's true that courts make those decisions in the context of cases only. Yes. But it is not the case that administrative officials are, under the constitutional scheme we have, as competent as courts in saying what the law is. 
PROr. LEVIN: We are now ready to proceed to the second of our major topics for today's discussion, a discussion of Heckler v. Chaney.5 7 We have been discussing up to now the scope-of-review rules that apply in so-called normal cases. We now move to a somewhat more restricted context, one that's been very controversial recently, the rules for judicial review of agency decisions not to take action, and other manifestations of what we might call prosecutorial discretion. 
It is especially topical now because it's the type of problem that's naturally going to come up in situations where you have an administration that is relatively unenthusiastic about enforcing statutes that more liberal administrations and Congresses have created in the past. But this topicality doesn't predispose how we're going to come out on it. For the authoritative word on that, the Assistant Attorney General. 
MR. WILLARD: My remarks today are going to be a little bit tentative, unlike those of some of my more scholarly colleagues. I would like to suggest a few thoughts on the theme of formalism and functionalism in judicial review of agency action and inaction. 
In the Chaney case, with which I suppose most of you are familiar, the facts are fairly bizarre. We had a group of prisoners who were on death row and who sued the Food and Drug Administration on the theory that the drugs used for lethal injection were unapproved. They claimed that this was an unapproved use of an approved drug and violated the Act's prohibitions on misbranding. (In fact, at one point we had a case, not the Chaney case but another case I was involved with in Texas," where they asked the court to issue a TRO to the Marshal Service to go out and actually seize the misbranded lethal injection drugs from the state prison at Huntsville.) The Chaney plaintiffs also suggested that the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act's requirements for the approval of new drugs should be applied, and that the FDA would have to decide whether the lethal injection drugs were safe and effective for human execution before they could be introduced into interstate commerce. 
The theory of the case was really quite ridiculous. In fact, the Supreme Court's opinion characterized the grant of certiorari as to review the "implausible result" reached by the D.C. Circuit. The lower court required the FDA to exercise its enforcement power to assure that the states only use drugs that are "safe and effective" in human execution. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed, and even Justice Marshall, who didn't agree with the majority opinion, agreed that the D.C. Circuit was wrong. 
The Court went on to hold that ordinarily an agency's refusal to exercise enforcement discretion is unreviewable. There's a presumption, although the Court outlined many exceptions to this doctrine. It was laying down basically a rule of statutory construction, of interpretation of the APA, and of administrative statutes generally: if Congress clearly wanted to make this kind of decision subject tojudicial review, it could, but ordinarily the courts would assume they did not want to. 
What I think is interesting about this case, though, is not so much the precise doctrine it announced for deciding when agency action is or is not reviewable, as to which there is a fair amount of unanimity on the Court, but the style ofjudicial reasoning. It calls to mind what I regard as one of the most brilliant pieces of scholarly legal writing I have ever read. It's now-Justice Scalia's article for the Supreme Court Review on "Vermont Yankee: The APA, the D.C. Circuit, and the Supreme Court,"6 ° in which he illustrated the point I would like to make. That is, 58See O'Bryan v. McKaskle, 729 F.2d 991 (5th Cir. 1984). 5'Chaney, 470 U.S. at 827. 1978 Sup. CT. REV. 345. that the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court have continued to adopt diametrically opposite approaches dealing with administrative law questions. The Supreme Court repeatedly invokes formalism and refers to the APA as the charter of administrative law. It always starts with this sort of hornbook explication of the APA and what it means. The D.C. Circuit could care less. It is interested in doing justice and having practical and functional approaches to these complex policy problems. You would think that after a while the D.C. Circuit would get the hint. Justice Scalia's article is fairly biting in its criticism and illustrates with great clarity the extent to which the D.C. Circuit at that time would go to evade the clear teachings of their superior court. I think that trend has continued unabated, and Heckler is a good example of it. 
Finally, we have a fairly recent example I'd like to mention, involving again a reviewability issue: Ciba-Geigy Corp. v. U.S. EPA,' which involves a question about whether a letter from an agency official is subject to judicial review. A majority of the panel of the D.C. Circuit held that it was. 
I would just briefly like to look at the style ofjudicial reasoning. The court, first of all, says that this ripeness issue involves a pragmatic balancing. "The judiciary's ultimate determination of ripeness in a specific setting depends on a pragmatic balancing of ...two variables and the underlying interests which they represent. Under this 'practical common sense' approach, the ripeness inquiry does not turn on nice legal distinctions."''2 This is the approach the Supreme Court has repeatedly repudiated for administrative law, because the Supreme Court always goes back to the nice legal distinctions-the words of the APA, for example. But no, the D.C. Circuit takes a broader, more pragmatic and functional approach. 
Going further, the court in Ciba-Geigy concluded that the term "agency action" encompasses an agency's interpretation of law; it further concluded that this interpretation can be expressed in a letter; and therefore, in the circumstances of this case, the letter from the agency was final enough to be subject to judicial review. 
Another factor about the D.C. Circuit's approach to these cases, and particularly its approach to Supreme Court precedent, is its willingness to engage in fairly thin distinctions of Supreme Court teachings. Justice Scalia's article, I think, illustrates this quite well: The extent to which the D.C. Circuit will go to cite D.C. Circuit precedents on points "180 1 F.2d 430 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (Starr, J.). " Id. at 434. for which there is clear Supreme Court teaching, which is never cited, or which is distinguished in fairly flimsy ways. 
One of the arguments made by the dissent in Ciba-Geigy was that this approach is inconsistent with the Chaney decision, which said that prosecutorial decisions are generally not subject to review. Since the agency had not yet instituted some kind of an enforcement action, the sending of a letter expressing their view about what they were going to do was not sufficiently final, in terms of agency action, to be reviewable.6 But the court had no trouble dealing with this allegation, or the concerns of Heckler, because it said in a footnote that, "[b]ecause the complaint states a colorable allegation that [Congress has fallen under one of the exceptions to the Chaney doctrine], we are not at liberty to decline jurisdiction for fear of interfering with prosecutorial discretion."'" In other words, a colorable allegation that the Supreme Court's teaching doesn't apply is enough to make it not apply! 
The point I would like to make, though, is that this is not a political difference. In other words, as Alan and Cass have both said, and I firmly agree, the difference in approach to administrative law between the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court is not a liberal-or-conservative thing. Whether or not the result is pro- or anti-business depends on what administration is in power and what they are doing. The Supreme Court has with almost remarkable unanimity advocated the formalistic approach to administrative law, and that includes Justices like Stevens and Brennan, who would be thought of as being quite liberal on other issues. 
Similarly, the D.C. Circuit has demonstrated a tendency, including judges who might otherwise be thought of as being conservative, to adopt the functional or pragmatic or flexible approach to administrative law. During the Carter administration businesses were happy to run to the D.C. Circuit and seek judicial review to halt oppressive agency regulations,just as public interest groups are happy to go there now to try to halt deregulation under the same kind of judicial approach that will allow the courts to take a probing, thorough, searching review of the agency's action or inaction. 
You can probably tell from my remarks which approach I think is preferable. But regardless of which one is preferable, I also have a view as to which of the two courts ought to be the supreme authority in this field! 
The remaining points I would like to make are on the question of 31d. at 442 (Silberman, J.,dissenting). "Id. at 436 n.8 (majority opinion). whether or not agency inaction, which was the issue in Heckler and raised in many of these other cases, ought to be subject to the same kind of review as agency action. I think the answer is no, for three reasons: for policy reasons, for administrative law reasons, and for constitutional reasons. 
Looking at policy-I realize that Cass has not had a chance to speak yet, but I've read a couple of his recent law review articles which have talked about this," and so I will try to express his views, although he may be better at it than I will be. He argues that public policy favors an even-handed approach to review of action and inaction, because there is a risk that people who are beneficiaries of statutory schemes will be deprived of those benefits if an agency refuses to carry out the statutory mandate. To him this is, as a policy matter, something that isjust as important as where an agency is excessively zealous in carrying out a statutory mandate. He says the courts should be particularly attuned to dealing with this danger, because agencies can be subject to factional and corrupt special interest pressures that will cause them not to carry out the congressional mandate as faithfully as they should, whereas the courts are better at transcending those pressures. 
I think there are some problems with this view, though. I think that Congress is just as subject, if not more so, to special interest factionalism in legislating as the executive is in executing the law. Actually more so, because Congress is so diverse, especially the House of Representatives these days, with redistricting going the way it is, with very homogeneous districts. Special interests have very frequent access to the legislative process. 
In terms ofjust simply public policy, I'm not sure there is any reason why the administrative process should be subject to some kind of special scrutiny to ensure that the process is done fairly and evenhandedly, unless you are going to review the legislative process for the same reason. Anyone who has seen the so-called tran-ion rules in the tax reform bill knows that it's not unheard of for s-- ial interests to obtain booty through the legislative process. 
For that reason, it's not as though we have a Congress that is pure in its intent and an executive that's corrupt. We have a political process at all levels. If, as a public policy matter, we ought to put the executive interpretative process under a microscope, then why not the legislative process too, to find out what kind of special ex parte contacts, for example, occurred with congressional committees? The ex parte contacts rule which was created by the D.C. Circuit out of whole cloth 66 may "See Sunstein, supra note 40, at 655-57. "'Homne Box Office, Inc. v. FCC, 567 F.2d 9 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied,434 U.S. 829(1977). or may not be a good idea, but it seems to me it isjust as good an idea for legislative committees as it is for executive agencies, in terms of the purpose of preventing special interest greed. 
There is the same question about the courts. Cass has developed the view that the courts are good at redressing this imbalance because frequently the political process can't, because beneficiaries of the statute are diverse and may be poor and may not have adequate access to the political process, whereas special interests do.', 
I think the same problem inheres in litigation. Public policy matters also frequently burden people in a diffuse way while benefiting people in a very particularized way. Sometimes beneficiaries are better placed, not only to participate in the political process, but also to initiate litigation to challenge something they don't like. Let's take an entitlements program, spending money. The people who get the entitlements, whether they be farmers or businesses, poor people or whatever, have a very particularized reason to try to defend and expand the entitlements program. The taxpayers who pick up the bill are very diffuse and spread out and much less likely to want to participate in litigation. 
My point is not that the scales tip one way or another. It's just that beneficiaries of statutory schemes may or may not have diffuse interests. People who are burdened may or may not have diffuse interests. I'm not sure there is a reason that the scale should necessarily be tilted one way or another, or a reason to prefer judicial review as a means of dealing with these problems as opposed to the political process. 
Let mejust briefly turn to my remaining two points. The question of the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act-as Cass has pointed out, the purpose of the Administrative Procedure Act was to limit and control agency action, not inaction. I think therefore the APA is not neutral as between agency action and inaction. That's not to say inaction is never reviewable. Sometimes it is. But I do think that the APA was adopted for the purpose, quite clearly expressed in its legislative history, of disfavoring agency action-burdening agency action and not inaction. 
Finally, I would like to look at the Constitution. Here again the Constitution is not neutral as between governmental action and inaction. The purpose of the Constitution was to protect the people against government action, not to compel the government to act to benefit people. Our Constitution contains none of the Soviet-style constitutional rights, such as the right to an adequate amount of leisure time or 17Sunstein, supra note 40, at 669. an adequate standard of living. Our Constitution primarily imposes limits on government, and for that reason I don't think our system is neutral as between whether a government agency acts or does not act. I think that reflects also the separation of powers doctrine and impacts on judicial review of agency action. 
In terms of the allocation of powers among the branches, my view is that when Congress legislates, obviously the legislation controls, in terms of what it does. Congress can leave gaps by legislating in broad or general terms. When that occurs, it falls to the executive, in executing the laws, to fill in the gaps. When Congress authorizes an agency to take certain kinds of actions, it provides general statutory guidance. The task of filling in the gaps, unless the statute directs otherwise, is one that is left to the agency and not to the courts, regardless of these other institutional arguments. After all, certain executive agencies are responsible to the President, who is an elected official and is able to harmonize varying interests and try to ensure that agencies act in the public interest in a coordinated way. 
MR. MORRISON: As Richard was speaking, I looked at my announcement for this program and confirmed that the topic was not the debate over whether we should reestablish a limited monarchy in the United States, but what we should do about Hecklerv. Chaney! So I thought that at least I would try to talk about that topic. 
My purpose here today.is neither to praise Heckler nor to bury it. I would have to acknowledge at the beginning that I had the presence of mind to file an amicus brief when I saw this case granted on the merits in the Supreme Court. We said to the Court, "Please, dear God, don't do what the Justice Department wants you to do and wipe out all judicial review." I think perhaps as a result of our brief there are at least four or five footnotes in the opinion which say, "we are not deciding all of the following issues," which we asked them not to decide, although we also asked them to decide something else as well. 
Nor do I intend to discuss the question on which my friend Ken Geller accused me of misstating the record-whether the reason the agency gave in Heckler for not going ahead was simply a throw-in. You may recall the original decision by the FDA. (It was in a letter, I might adid, because that's how they respond to all petitions-I can't figure out any other way to get them to respond to anything, but at least they do write letters once in a while. That's the only way, it seems, to get into court with them.) The letter said, "we refuse to undertake this little exercise that you've asked us to do, because this comes within the practice of medicine exception to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act." Lo and behold, when that issue got to the D.C. Circuit, everyone, including Judge Scalia, said that's ridiculous. When it got to the Supreme Court, the government didn't seek to defend the decision on the ground that it was part of the practice of medicine exception. Theyjust said, we have prosecutorial discretion. 
If you look at the letter that was sent out by the FDA, you will see language very akin to letters that I have seen many other times in the past. It said, "and besides, even if we could do it, it's a waste of time. We don't want to bother to do it." That is, they ground out the usual final, defensive sentence. If you go look at the record, you may read it differently than I. I suggest to you that this was nothing but a form at the end, saying "prosecutorial discretion." I said it was a throw-in, and maybe the court ought to be given an opportunity to allow the agency to decide whether it was really exercising prosecutorial discretion. That would be a different case. 
In any event, what I'd like to do is look at the paradigm enforcement case under Heckler, ask some questions about that, and then go through some other situations and see to what extent those same reasons should or shouldn't apply. 
Let's assume for the moment that a landowner who has some property asks the EPA to bring an enforcement action against the W. R. Grace Company because it's polluting the land. The groundwater is leeching onto their property, their children are dying, and as a result they want the EPA to go after the company. They ask it to bring civil and criminal enforcement proceedings. The EPA says no for any number of reasons: the company isn't violating the law; the law doesn't apply; it is simply a technical violation; and the EPA is simply too busy and has other things to do with its time and money. 
In theory, under Heckler, in all of those cases the reason the Court would say we don't want to get involved (and the district courts shouldn't get involved) is there is "no law to apply.""' But what if, for instance, the sole reason given in Heckler was that the practice of medicine exception applies? "That is the sole reason. We have no other reason for refusing to do it. Our hands are tied behind us." Is there no law to apply in that situation? Can the Court really have meant that? Or in the EPA case, the same kind of question could arise. 
Of course, it's important to ask, is the homeowner in our hypothetical without remedy? Cannot that person whose property was injured go out and sue the company itself? Indeed, couldn't the defendants on death row in Chaney have gone and done that themselves? In fact, a number of them did that before they asked for help at the FDA. They had gone into the state courts and claimed that death by drug injection 18470 U.S. at 834-35. violated the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and therefore they could not lawfully be executed. You can imagine what kind of reception they got in that case, with state officials on the one hand and state courts on the other. You didn't have to get to the practice of medicine exception. They just simply said, "No, you must be kidding"-which is what Justice Rehnquist said. And maybe ultimately it makes sense to say "you must be kidding." But there must be a better way of saying it than simply that. 
Well, why didn't the Court say that that's really what's at stake here? Why this camouflage effort? I don't know. But it does seem to me that even in the paradigm enforcement case, under certain circumstances, where a person has no other remedy (and that's not likely to be true in many cases, although it may be in some), it may well be that Chaney doesn't mean what it says. 
Now let's move to a few other situations. Let's take the far more common situation of rulemaking. There is a rulemaking proceeding, and at the end of the proceeding, a potential beneficiary of a rule is dissatisfied. The claim is that the rule is a lousy rule-that the agency didn't go as far as he wanted-or that the rule is illegal-or that it's arbitrary and capricious--or that it's unconstitutional. Whatever it is, the bottom line is that it didn't help us enough. 
Is there any reason to believe, if the agency didn't go far enough, that that's a kind of prosecutorial discretion? I suggest not. The courts have been reviewing those kinds of disputes for a very long period of time, and I think that those disputes can and should continue to be reviewable. Similarly, what happens if, at the end of a rulemaking proceeding that the agency has duly commenced, the agency, instead of issuing a lousy rule, simply issues no rule at all? They say, we don't think there's enough of a problem. Isn't that precisely the same kind of determination, albeit to a somewhat different degree, as in the last situation? Or what about the situation in which a petition is filed with the agency, and it sends a letter back saying, we decline to commence a rulemaking proceeding because we have no jurisdiction, or the practice of medicine exception applies, or we can't legally give you the relief you want even though we do have jurisdiction. Or we don't have enough facts to sustain a rule at this time, or even to begin a rulemaking proceeding at which we can gather more facts. Or the rule is simply not important enough-we've got too many other things on our agenda. 
Does Chaney preclude all of those decisions from being judicially reviewed? I suggest to you that the answer may well depend upon the reasons given. I believe that the right to review should not depend on what the agency says. The question that should be asked, however, is whether the scope of review is different, depending upon the reason given by the agency. I agree that when an agency says "we're too busy, we can't get to this matter now, there are 5,000 people a year dying from other substances, and even if your allegations were true, there's only 100 dying from this substance, we simply don't have enough resources," the court should not be in the business of saying, "well, if you counted the numbers differently or if you really cared about it, you would have time for everything." But that is a question of scope of review. It is not a question of whether you should get into court at all. 
All right. Turning away from rulemaking, let's get into other kinds of adjudications. How about formal adjudication? In a number of areas, for instance with the Federal Election Commission, a person whose complaint is turned down has a statutory right to go to court and get itjudicially reviewed. The D.C. Circuit has recently reviewed a case involving a Mr. OrloskiY who had a dispute about an election. They did exactly in that case what the Supreme Court said they couldn't begin to do in Heckler v. Chaney, although the plaintiff still lost. Should that difference turn upon whether Congress inserted a judicial review provision? I suggest it should not. The scope of review may be one thing; the right to review should be something else. 
Or take informal adjudication, a case like Overton Park.7 "Did ChaneyN overrule Overton Park? I don't think so, because in Overton Park they were complaining about what the agency in fact did. That is, it issued a permit to let somebody go through Overton Park. Or if the opposite had been true, if the Overton Park developer had been denied the permit to go through Overton Park, surely the developer could have gone to court without worrying about Chaney and whether a law enforcement proceeding was involved. 
Then there's another category of cases coming up, and I don't know whether there are more of them in this administration or whether we're simply developing a subspecialty in our own office-it's called unreasonable delay, or "You can't get usjudicially reviewed if we won't tell you what the answer is." Right now, we have a problem in which they won't even send us a letter back, to tell us whether they're going to deny our petition. We want to go in and sue them, saying we are entitled to an answer-are you or are you not going to commence a rulemaking? Just an answer, yes or no. We're entitled to that. Or: Are you or are you not going to take action on our complaint, even a Chaney complaint? Aren't the plaintiffs in Chaney, even if they are not entitled 7""OCriltoizseknis vt.o FPErCes,er7v9e5 OF.v2edrton Park, hic. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402 (1971). 
156 (D.C. Cir. 1986). to go to court to object to the result when the agency doesn't do something, at least entitled to go to court and say, please, don't we get an answer? 
On this, fortunately, the APA is quite specific. It specifically proscribes unreasonable delay in two separate sections,7 and the courts to date, as far as I know, have been unanimous in saying that there are standards, albeit loose and flexible ones, for saying when enough is enough. At least the agencies have got to tell the court and the parties what their intentions are. I suggest to you that it shouldn't matter whether it's a rulemaking or an enforcement procedure-unreasonable delay is unreasonable delay. And that applies in spades in a situation in which there is an ongoing proceeding, in which the agency has had comments in for months or years, and it is sitting around and sitting around, putting off a decision in order to avoid difficulty. 
Then let me take the last of my set of examples, the most difficult I am sure, and that is the Adams v. Richardson72 wholesale refusal to enforce the law. Adas was a case in which in many prior administrations-the case is still going on, I think-there have been charges that the Department of Health, Education and Welfare simply refused to enter into the civil rights fray at all. They were sitting on the sideline, and the statute gives clear responsibilities (obligations, as the D.C. Circuit found) to do certain things-that is, they have to enforce the law. If the states don't do what the law says, then the agencies are supposed to do any of a number of things. The court in those cases is not concerned with saying you must do A, B or C, but that you can't refuse to do all of them. 
There is, of course, a footnote in Chaney to that effect7 -which reminds me of the old adage that footnotes are for losers, rather like statistics in football games. I do think that that is a different kind of case, once again. Or what if, to take an example near and dear to the heart of this administration, the United States Attorney had the temerity to decide that he was not going to waste his resources on pornography cases, that he had better things to do, like putting drug dealers in jail. If there was a big porn shop that opened up next door to my house, would I have standing to come into court, or would that be a situation in which the U.S. Attorney can say, we simply aren't going to enforce the law any more? 
Well, if you read Chaney and try to get to the philosophical underpinnings of it all, its basis is: "Look, this is a political system of accountability. We elect Presidents and we have political contests over this question." I want to ask you-how many people in the world do you think are going to decide whom to vote for in 1988 based upon whether the Food and Drug Administration went after drugs or not in Heckler v. Chaney, or whether they're going to go after the porn shops in my hypothetical? The Court has a very interesting notion about how responsive our government is to each and every citizen, but one that I suggest to you has no bearing in reality. 
Nor do I suggest to you that it would be any better for Congress to try to get itself involved, even if' after Chadha there were some realistic possibility that it could constitutionally do so. Congress cannot-indeed should not-try to get involved in every single situation in which an agency doesn't enforce the law. The question really is, what are we supposed to tell people who see laws on the books and believe that the laws are there to be enforced by the agency? Shall we simply tell them to go on in their own way, and someday in the election for President they can win on the ground that the prior party in office didn't enforce the law? 
It seems to me that, as imperfect as the courts may be from time to time (and they are, every time I've lost a case), there isn't a whole lot better alternative here, and I, for one, am not prepared, deferentially or otherwise, to turn the matter over entirely to the executive branch. 
Thank you very much. 
JUDGE STARR: Let me make one very quick observation with respect to Mr. Willard's comments on formalism and functionalism. He sees the Supreme Court speaking with unanimity, and I agree that in this area it has spoken with unanimity in a surprising number of cases; but on a closer analysis, as Professor Levin has tried to indicate, the tapestry is considerably richer. With respect to the specific recent case of which Mr. Willard spoke, a case in which I have considerable interest, 7*1 the court's remarks with regard to pragmatic considerations were taken from a functionalist opinion w7 ritten by that formalist justice, Justice Harlan, in Abbott Laboratories.' 
PROF. SUNSTEIN: Mine is a plea for equality. If an administrative agency acts, there is a presumption of reviewability. If an administrative agency doesn't act, there is now a presumption of unreviewability. The presumption of reviewability isn't made up by the D.C. Circuit. It comes from the legislative history of the Administrative Procedure Act. What is the basis for this inequality created by Heckler v. Chaney? One possibility: Congress, in writing the Administrative Procedure 774CAibbbao-GtteLigayboCraotropr.ievs. vE.PGA,ar4d3n0er(,D3.C87.CUir..S1.918366) ((S19ta6r7r),. J.). Act, was concerned, Mr. Willard said, with action. Yet the APA defines "action" to include failure to act7. 6 75 U.S.C. § 551(13) (1982). '7l6iUd..S§. 7C0O6N(S1)T.. art. I, § 3. inaction. What it means, instead, is that on the merits agency inaction will very, very, very frequently be perfectly lawful, because you have a lawful allocation of scarce resources. 
The D.C. Circuit, correctly readingHecklerv. Chaney, has understood it very much in these terms. The court has understood the case to say what now-ChiefJustice Rehnquist says-which is, when there is "law" to control administrative agency inaction, when a statute controls that inaction, then the decision is reviewable and the presumption of reviewability kicks in. 
PROF. LEVIN: I'm going to waive my own opportunity to comment, because my comments on Chaney are expressed in the Restatement report itself," and because I want to give an opportunity for anyone who has questions for these speakers to ask them. If you do, there are microphones standing on your right or left, or both, depending on where you're sitting. 
JAMES T. O'REILLY:o I believe in the pendulum theory of administrative law, and I think that the Chevron discussion and particularly Alan's comments on it prove that. (Alan, on behalf of the Senator Bumpers Alumni Club, we're sending you a backdated honorary membership card from seven years ago, now that you find some merit in his amendment!) 
In my field, though, food and drug law, we often hear the statement made by a former Chief Counsel of the FDA that the statute is a constitution, that unless FDA is prohibited from acting, then the FDA has the power to act, and that the FDA can update the 1930s New Deal legislation by adding regulations it feels are necessary. 8' I think that Chevroncarries that notion even further, and even says that, in addition to the.FDA creating what it can, the courts will be willing to defer, in light of the ambiguity in that 50-year-old piece of legislation. 
But again, I believe in a pendulum theory, and I try to emphasize to my students that the courts will swing back. My question to the panel is, if the courts will swing back from Chevron, what will be the indicia of that chain? What should we look for to see greater constraints upon agency discretion, and what elements, what facts, or what kinds of agency actions will cause the pendulum to swing back? 
MR. MORRISON: All I can say is that I think the better cases come up where there are some visceral reactions, some danger signals. If I were 7 Levin, supra note 1, at 284-88. 
"Corporation Counsel, Procter & Gamble Co.; Adjunct Professor of Law, University of C1incinnati. 
" Hutt, Philosophy of Regulation Under the FederalFood, Drug & Cosmetic Act, 28 FooD DRUG COSM. L.J. 177, 178 (1973). going to start challenging Chevron, that's where I would first try to say, "You surely didn't mean to apply it in that area." It would be a chipping away first, and then perhaps an unadmitted pendulum would swing back the other way. 
My own view is that Chevron is good law when the courts want to decide in the agency's favor, and they disregard it when they don't. There are simply many cases in which they don't bother to cite Chevron and the agency loses. 
RODOLPHE J.A. DE SEIrE: 2 I also teach my students the pendulum approach to law. Are we resuscitating the nondelegation doctrine? 
MR. MORRISON: Well, I tried to resuscitate it but didn't succeed in Gramm-Rudman.13 The majority said they weren't going to decide it. Two Justices said-well, if you can figure out what they said, I'll be glad to hear from you-I think they said something like what I was going to say but not quite what I said. And two other Justices said they agreed with the lower court, which included now-Justice Scalia. So who knows where the nondelegation doctrine is? 
PRoF. DE SEIrE: It's not dead, that's the point. 
MR. MORRISON: Well, some of us don't think it's dead, although one could hardly say it's revived with the same vigor it once had. 
MR. WILLARD: I think the nondelegation doctrine is and ought to be dead. The doctrine misconceives the nature of what Congress does (and I think this goes back to what we were talking about before) when it empowers an executive agency to act. It doesn't delegate a piece of the legislative power to the executive branch, which will then exercise it as an "agent of the legislature." What it does is that it creates authority in the executive branch, and when the executive branch carries out that authority it is executing the law. It's not exercising a delegated lawmaking function. 
Then, when the courts review that exercise of authority, they are doing something entirely different. They are exercising a judicial function to decide a case or controversy in light of the applicable law. So I think the words "delegation" and "quasi-legislative" and "quasijudicial" are all very misleading terms, in that they obscure the proper separation of powers analysis. 
PETER L. STRAUSS:" This may be turning into a forum for professors of administrative law, but I want to ask a question about the possible virtues of confusing the scope of review question with the merits, in the following way. The Supreme Court 
MR. MORRISON: Is this a Chevron question or a Chaney question or both? 
PROF. STRAUSS: It's more a Chevron question than a Chaney question, but I think it has elements of both. 
The Supreme Court decides 150 cases a year on all subjects, in the course of attempting to administer national law. The courts of appeals are in the position of deciding cases much more frequently, for limited geographical areas, but in cases which bear on the administration of national programs nonetheless. I wonder if it isn't important to view Chevron as an aspect of the Supreme Court's management of the courts of appeals-particularly, perhaps, this unending struggle between the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court. One aspect of that management, which may in the long run tend to give more room for uniformity in the administration of national programs, would be to send the courts of appeals the message that they are not to interfere with reasonable statutory interpretations of administrative agencies. There's a natural tendency for a court of appeals to become absorbed with the immediate, local consequences of adopting a given interpretation of a regulatory statute. Chevron helps correct this tendency by requiring courts to defer to the interpretations of agencies that bear direct responsibility for implementing the program as a whole. Instead of attempting a "point" solution, which can and probably will vary from circuit to circuit, reviewing courts are now invited to define a permitted zoneand those zones may overlap, allowing the agency to survive in all the circuits with a single definition. The agency's obligation to strive for uniformity in national administration can be achieved in other ways, as by making "consistency" a central element of the "hard look" review the Supreme Court endorsed in State Farm. 
PROF. SUNSTEIN: For me, if one properly understands directly addressing the precise question at issue, that's a merits question. Did Congress make unlawful what the agency did? One should try to separate, to the extent possible, the question "does the agency win?," on the one hand, from, on the other hand, "does one have a thumb on the scales in the agency's favor when one approaches the merits?" Those are two separate questions. 
I do think Professor Strauss is correct in understanding Chevron as an effort to give managerial guidance to the lower courts, particularly the D.C. Circuit. But I also think one wants to be a little bit more gentle on the D.C. Circuit, and not just because one of its members is here. The D.C. Circuit specializes in administrative law cases; it sees a whole spectrum of administrative law cases. The Supreme Court only sees occasional and maybe hard cases, and somebody has said that hard cases make bad law. Maybe on occasion in administrative law this kind of one-shot intervention has hurt rather than helped. 
Keep in mind that there have been a lot of new appointments to the D.C. Circuit in the last few years, so one doesn't have the kind of ideological disparity one had in the recent past. But an occasional tension between the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court continues. It may be that's inevitable and not the product of bad faith in any way, but the product of different institutional perspectives. It may even, in the end, be not so bad that there's a tension between a specialist administrative law court and an occasional one-shot intervenor in cases of perceived abuses. 
PROF. LEVIN: I'll make a brief comment on that also. It relates to the differing roles of the Supreme Court and the courts of appeals. Both I and Cass have criticized the Court today for muddling the distinction between pure questions of law and review for abuse of discretion. I would suggest that one reason why the Court may do that is that it very rarely reviews actual exercises of agency discretion. Most cases that come to the Court are framed as raising pure legal issues, and I think that is the type of question that the Court is most comfortable with. On the other hand, the lower courts find themselves obliged to distinguish law from discretion more sharply, because they have to review the agency decision as a whole, including discretionary and factual elements that the Court would be unlikely to grant cert. to examine in the first place. 
But there's room for optimism about the future, now that the Court has its newest member, who is not only an administrative law expert but also has spent a couple of years on the D.C. Circuit slogging around in mundane administrative cases that raise these issues as wholes. Perhaps more rigorous treatments from the Supreme Court can be expected in the future for both those reasons. 
MR. MORRISON: First, you were talking about hard cases making bad law. I think Justice Marshall in his concurring opinion in Chaney said that easy cases make bad law! 
But Peter's point is interesting because, in a way, it is contrary to the point that the Court made just a year before in State Farm. For years most people had thought that if you argued an arbitrary-andcapricious case, that was the equivalent in administrative law terms to arguing the rational basis test under equal protection, i.e., you lost. One thing the Supreme Court said in State Farm is that you can win arbitrary-and-capricious cases, and once in a while we're going to even let those folks in the D.C. Circuit get away with saying you can win them. So, if what they're trying to tell the courts of appeals is to keep their hands off, that message is hard to reconcile. 
PROF. STRAUSS: No, because that kind of intervention will be much less disturbing to the agency. The courts of appeals also are occasional intervenors when it comes to a question of interpreting complex, extensive statutory schemes for which the courts of appeals hold no responsibility. It's quite a different matter for the court of appeals to say to an agency, "In this one case your result was arbitrary and capricious," than it is for the court of appeals to say to an agency, "Well, you read this complicated statute that way, we read it this way." Saying the latter may, in an arguably undue or unconscious way, mess up the entire statutory scheme, as Judge Starr has suggested in his presentation. 
MR. MORRISON: I don't think we should have a full dialogue, but you have now put the question in a way which implies that the court of appeals had 'just one little way to interfere" in State Farm,whereas they were "messing up the entire scheme" in the bubble case. One could equally well say that the bubble was "only one little part of the regulatory scheme," and in State Farm they were "undermining the entire Transportation Department." 
To the extent that you are saying that when the issue goes to the essence of an agency's regulatory authority and deals with the entire question of how you ought to deal with a major substantive problem, I would agree that it may make more sense to give the agency deference. But I don't sense that the bubble case is that kind of an example, although I could be wrong about it. But if it were, it wasn't defended on that ground anyway. 
HENRI F. RusH: s' My question to the panel has been touched on, I believe, but perhaps we could get some more comment. A number of pieces of recent legislation contain very precise standards by which a party's request for ruling is to bejudged if turned down by the agency. In the case of my agency, a request for rulemaking in the rail area has a very specific set of criteria which we must go through.87 Obviously that's reviewable-we'd never contend it's not-but does that suggest that all the other areas of rulemaking or refusal of rulemaking are not reviewable? 
MR. MORRISON: My answer is no, but I'm sure Richard's answer would be yes. See, we'll get this in a brief: the other side'll say, "When 86Deputy General Counsel, Interstate Commerce Commission. 
8749 U.S.C. § 10326(b)(2) (1982). Congress wanted to be specific, it certainly knew how to do it. Since it wasn't, you don't have any law to apply and therefore you're left to the political processes." 
MR. WILLARD: Alan understands me better than I understand myself! 
What struck me about your question is the similarity to the question the Supreme Court faced in Vermont Yankee. There we had a situation of hybrid rulemaking procedures. Congress had indicated over a period of time a dissatisfaction with the rigid categories of the APA, by adopting special hybrid rulemaking provisions for certain agencies in certain situations. This may have indicated there was something wrong with the APA, but Congress never got around to amending the APA, and the Supreme Court said it was illegitimate for the D.C. Circuit to use its common law administrative power to rewrite the APA unless Congress wanted to. 
My view is that while these statutes may indicate that modern thinking is that there should be more review of the failure to engage in rulemaking, unless and until Congress gets around to amending the APA to provide that, which I certainly think they could constitutionally, the traditional view should prevail. 
PROFESSOR LEVIN: That concludes the time we have for questions. I'll turn the mike over to Ed Grenier for our closing. 
MR. GRENIER: Thank you very much. I think we all agree that we have heard from a very skillful and just a wonderful panel, including our moderator. I have the impression they're all right, and that's really difficult. Let's give them a good round of applause. 
INTRODUCTION 
Constitutional law tends, to define itself through reaction to great cases. The defining case for the last several decades was Brown v. Board of Education'-an example of social reorganization, in the interest of a racial minority, brought about through the judiciary. Roe v. Wade2 has to some extent played this role for the past decade, and its status as a defining case may grow larger in the next generation. But for more than a half-century, the most important of all defining cases has been Lochner v. New York. 3 The spectre of Lochner has loomed over most important constitutional decisions, whether they uphold or invalidate governmental practices.4 In the different answers to the question, what was wrong with the decision in Lochner?, can be found the various posi* Professor of Law, University of Chicago. This is a revised version of the Samuel tions on most of the major constitutional issues of the modem era.5 
The received wisdom is that Lochner was wrong because it involved 'judicial activism": an illegitimate intrusion by the courts into a realm properly reserved to the political branches of government. This view has spawned an enormous literature6 and takes various forms. 7 The basic understanding has been endorsed by the Court in many cases taking the lesson of the Lochner period to be the need for judicial deference to legislative enactments. 8 
The principal purpose of this essay, descriptive in character, is to understand Lochner from a different point of view. For the Lochner Court, neutrality, understood in a particular way, was a constitutional requirement. The key concepts here are threefold: government inaction, the existing distribution of wealth and entitlements, and the baseline set by the common law. Governmental intervention was constitutionally troublesome, whereas inaction was not; and both neutrality and inaction were defined as respect for the behavior of private actors pursuant to the common law, in light of the existing distribution of wealth and entitlements. Whether there was a departure from the requirement of neutrality, in short, depended on whether the government had altered the common law distribution of entitlements. Market ordering under the common law was understood to be a part of nature rather than a legal construct, and it formed the baseline from which to measure the constitutionally critical lines that distinguished action from inaction and neutrality from impermissible partisanship. This understanding of the Lochner period is faithful to what the Court said when it both engaged in and abandoned Lochner-like reasoning, and it points to an important element in the Lochner Court's approach, one that has little to do with an aggressive judicial role in general. 9

stresses an active judicial role is an inescapably normative question, taken up infra notes 144-67 and accompanying text. The principal effort here is to set forth an alternative approach that fits the history at least as well and that has dramatically different implications. See infra notes 168-205 and accompanying text. Moreover, this understanding 
Understood in this way, however, Lochner has many descendants in current law. Numerous decisions depend in whole or in part on common law baselines or understandings of inaction and neutrality that owe their origin to Lochner-like understandings. And if Lochneris understood in these terms, its heirs are not Roe v. Wade10 and Miranda v. 
Valeo,13 Regents of California v. Bakke, 14 and various cases immunizing those who are thought not to be "state actors" from constitutional constraints. These and other decisions can be understood from a unitary perspective through the lens of the Lochner period. Such a perspective may or may not justify dramatic departures from current law. It may be that modem doctrine, insofar as it shares Lochner's premises, is entirely unobjectionable. 
The second purpose of the essay is normative. To some degree, Lochner-like themes are so deeply ingrained in the constitutional order, indeed in the very concept of constitutionalism, 15 that it would be hopeless to attempt to abandon them even if it were desirable to do so. But in some settings, the modem progeny of Lochner, like Lochner itself, depend on false premises and lead to unfortunate results. Most important, the baselines selected by the Court and the use of the key concepts -"neutrality" and "inaction"- are often a mistake, for the same reasons that originally led to the rejection of Lochner and the common law system of regulation generally. The eventual task is to design a set of constitutional doctrines that does not derive from common law rules but that instead builds on still-emerging principles that might be roughly associated with the New Deal. The final section of this Article ventures some thoughts on how to accomplish that task. 
Almost eighty years since the case was decided, the lesson of the Lochner period has yet to be settled. The purpose of this Article is to suggest that the case should be taken to symbolize not merely an aggressive judicial role, but an approach that imposes a constitutional requirement of neutrality, and understands the term to refer to preservation of the existing distribution of wealth and entitlements under the baseline of the common law. Thus understood, Lochner has hardly been overruled. was not invented in the Lochner era. See Fletcher v. Peck, 10 U.S. (6 Granch) 87 (1810) (using contract clause and "general principles ... common to our free institutions" to invalidate rescissions of a land grant). 

Slagstaad eds. forthcoming 1988). 
It will be useful to begin with excerpts from two important decisions associated with the Lochner period. The first excerpt is from 
wage legislation for women and children. The Court said: To the extent that the sum fixed [by the minimum wage statute] exceeds the fair value of the services rendered, it amounts to a compulsory exaction from the employer for the support of a partially indigent person, for whose condition there rests upon him no peculiar responsibility, and therefore, in effect, arbitrarily shifts to his shoulders a burden which, if it belongs to anybody, belongs to society as a whole.' 7 
The next excerpt is from the case generally thought to spell the downfall ofLochner. In the 1937 decision of West Coast Hotelv. Parrish,Is the Court upheld a minimum wage law for women. The Court said: The exploitation of a class of workers who are in an unequal position with respect to bargaining power and are thus relatively defenceless against the denial of a living wage.., casts a direct burden for their support upon the community. What these workers lose in wages the taxpayers are called upon to pay .... The community is not bound to provide what is in effect a subsidy for unconscionable employers.' 9 
The notion of subsidy is of course incoherent without a baseline from which to make a measurement. Both of these excerpts refer to subsidies, but by the time of West Coast Hotel, the concept has been turned on its head. In Adkins, the Court saw minimum wage legislation as requiring a subsidy to the public from an innocent employer. Such legislation was thus a kind of "taking" from A to B. According to the Court, if B is needy, it is not A, but the public at large, who should pay. In West Coast Hotel, it is the failure of a state to have minimum wage legislation that amounts to a subsidy--this time, from the public to the employer.2 0 The common law system, for the West Coast Hotel Court, turns out to subsidize "unconscionable employers." In the fifteen-year period between Adkins and West Coast Hotel, the baseline has been shifted. What accounts for the shift? In answering that question, it will be useful to turn to Lochner itself. 

constitutionally required. Notably, both Adkins and West Coast Hotel involved statutes discriminating on the basis of gender; such statutes tended, in both purpose and effect, to diminish the employment prospects of women. See Landes, The Effect of State Maximum-Hours Laws on the Employment of Women in 1920, 88 J. Pol. Econ. 476 (1980); Nelson, Women's Poverty and Women's Citizenship: Some Political Consequences of Economic Marginality, 10 Signs 209, 228-29 ( 
Lochner involved a regulation enacted by the state of New York prohibiting employers from permitting or requiring bakers to work for more than sixty hours in a week. The Court's analysis came in several steps. The Court said that the right of contract-in particular, the right to buy and sell labor-is part of the liberty protected by the due process clause. But the Court recognized that the "police power" was available to justify intrusions on liberty of contract; thus, for example, the government could protect health or morals by restricting contractual agreements. Here, however, the Court concluded that maximum hour legislation was not permissible as a "labor law," because bakers were of full legal capacity and "in no sense wards of the State." 21 Only wards could be protected through labor legislation. 
The Court also concluded that the statute could not be defended as a health law. The problem was that the state could not demonstrate a close connection between maximum hour regulation and the protection of health. There was no sufficient showing that a maximum hour law was necessary to protect health; and if the evidence brought forth here were thought sufficient, the state's power would be unlimited. The Court concluded that the statute was "in reality, passed from... motives" 22 other than protection of health-motives that were illegitimate but that the Court did not specify. 
For the contemporary observer, two features of the Court's approach are especially distinctive. The first is the sharp limitation of the category of permissible government ends. Efforts to redistribute resources and paternalistic measures were both constitutionally out of bounds. They did not fall within the "police power"; the employer had committed no common law wrong, and regulatory power was largely limited to the redress of harms recognized at common law. This limitation of the category of permissible ends had important implications, excluding a wide range of measures enacted by majorities. The scope of the "police power," as understood in the Lochner era, has never been entirely clear.23 But there can be no doubt that most forms of redistribution and paternalism were ruled out. 
The second step in the Court's approach consists of careful scrutiny of the relationship between the permissible end invoked by the state to support the statute and the means chosen by the state to promote that end. The Court was unsatisfied by the claim that limitations on working hours contributed to the health of bakers, notwithstanding the plausible nature of the claim-hence Justice Harlan's powerful dissent.24 It would thus be possible to accept, as did Justice Harlan, the limitation of police power and at the same time to uphold the legisla21. 198 U.S. at 57. 
15-16. 
tion attacked in Lochner. On the other hand, one could reject both features of the Court's approach, as did Justice Holmes in his famous dissent. 
There is, moreover, a close relationship between the two elements of the Court's approach; the one reinforces the other. The careful scrutiny of means-ends connections operates to "flush out" 25 impermissible ends. If there is no class of impermissible ends, means-ends scrutiny is incoherent.2 6 And by impermissible ends, the Court appeared to be referring to what we may call "raw" interest-group transfers.2 7 Because the only available public justifications were insufficient, the minimum wage statute was invalidated as an interest-group deal, reflecting nothing other than political power. Above all, the Court's concern was that maximum hour legislation was partisan rather than neutral-selfish rather than public-regarding. 28 It was neutrality that the due process clause commanded, 2 9 and neutrality was served only by the general or "public" purposes comprehended by the police power. If the statute could be justified as a labor or health law, it would be sufficiently public to qualify as neutral. Since no such justification was

and other measures might redistribute wealth without running afoul of the due process clause; and the poor laws were generally immune from constitutional attack. Grey, The Malthusian Constitution, 41 U. Miami L. Rev. 21 ( hoc basis, of the sort represented by maximum hour and minimum wage laws, was unconstitutional if unsupported by a justification deemed "general" or "public." Cf. Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. 381 (1798) (Chase, J.) (discussing natural law principles prohibiting transfers from A to B). 
The preference for redistribution through taxation rather than regulation might have been the product of the broader interest in promoting generality in lawmaking. If redistribution is ad hoc, it could be perverse and in any event less visible. The requirement of generality in redistribution promotes visibility and at the same time ensures that any redistribution is to those genuinely or most in need. Compare the debate over affirmative action, discussed infra text accompanying notes 113-17. The ad hoc character of affirmative action schemes is sometimes thought to be an argument against them and in favor of more general methods of alleviating the distribution of benefits and burdens among blacks and whites. On the other hand, the requirement of generality might allow well-organized private groups to mobilize in defense of the status quo. In this sense the requirement fits comfortably with the broader hostility to redistribution. 
must be defensible as public-regarding under a wide range of constitutional provisions. See Sunstein, Naked Preferences and the Constitution, 84 Colum. L. Rev. 1689 ( for various defenses, see infra note 166. In the Lochner era, however, the category of justifications that would count as "public" was small, excluding paternalistic and redistributive matters. Cf. Hawaii Hous. Auth. v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229 ( meaningless the public use requirement under the eminent domain clause). 
Rev. 1 (1959) (discussing similar requirement of neutrality imposed on judges), discussed in more detail infra notes 109-11 and accompanying text. available, it was invalidated as impermissibly partisan-what might now be called special-interest legislation. The legislative result was thus unprincipled; it depended on "whose ox is gored." Under this framework, the common law categories were taken as a natural rather than social construct. The status of the common law as a part of nature undergirded the view that the common law should form the baseline from which to measure deviations from neutrality, or self-interested 3 0 "deals." 
Justice Holmes' celebrated dissenting opinion is a rejection of neutrality altogether. It comes close to modem interest-group pluralism, which treats the political process as an unprincipled struggle among self-interested groups for scarce social resources.3 1 Under this view, Lochner's means-ends scrutiny, examining whether there is a "public" and hence neutral justification for the statute, is difficult to understand. Holmes' opinion treats the political process as a kind of civil war, in which the powerful succeed; if courts interfere, they will be bottling up forces that will express themselves elsewhere in other and more destructive forms.3 2 Thus for Holmes, the Constitution does not prevent "the natural outcome of a dominant opinion." '33 
the rejection of Spencer's Social Statics,34 with which Holmes was sympathetic as a matter of personal predilection; the proposition that the Constitution does not embody any particular social and economic theory; and its author's apparent willingness to disregard his personal views in the process of constitutional interpretation. But the opinion is virtue of its status as such, immunized from collective control. Marginal and not-somarginal adjustments were permissible. Nonetheless, the basic framework of the common law formed the baseline from which to decide cases. Indeed, one can trace to this period the idea that legislative extinguishment of"core" common law rights was permissible only if the legislature furnished an adequate alternative remedy. See, e.g., New York Cent. R.R. v. White, 243 U.S. 188 (1917) (upholding workers' compensation in part because of quid pro quo); see also Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envtl. Study Group, 438 U.S. 59, 88 & n.32 ( Act against due process challenge but suggesting relevance of quid pro quo). 
Second, the protection of common law rights depended not merely on the fact that the rights at issue were protected by the common law, but also on the (unsurprising) fact that the common law corresponded to a widely held normative theory about the proper role of government. The interests protected at common law thus tracked the category of natural rights. For a modern statement, see Epstein, A Theory of Strict Liability, 2 J. Legal Stud. 151 (1973); R. Epstein, supra note 5.

Sci. 3 ( Federal Courts: Crisis and Reform ( best understood as an outgrowth of the very species of constitutional social Darwinism that it purports to reject. Holmes' market-oriented conception of politics and his skepticism about normative argument are the very personal building blocks for his enthusiasm for judicial deference. 3 5 
The decline of the Lochner understanding was slow and wavering. In some cases the Court upheld statutes by deferring to claims of plausible means-ends connections. Elsewhere the Court seemed gradually to conclude that redistributive goals were permissibly public and thus in some sense neutral, even if there was a departure from the common law; the common law categories thus broke down.3 6 But it was in West Coast Hotel that the Court rejected the theoretical foundations of the Lochner period. The case involved a statute providing minimum wages for women. Perhaps oddly, at least to modem readers, the emphasis of the opinion was not on the undemocratic character of the Court's previous approach or on the value ofjudicial deference to legislative determinations. 3 7 Instead the Court stressed the need for minimum wage regulation, referring to "the exploiting of workers at wages so low as to be insufficient to meet the bare cost of living" and the fact that "the exploitation of a class of workers who are in an unequal position with respect to bargaining power casts a direct burden for their support upon the community."3 8 In perhaps the most striking passage of the opinion, the Court referred to the subsidy problem and added, "[t]he community may direct its law-making power to correct the abuse which springs from [employers'] selfish disregard of the public interest."' 39 
used to help those unable to protect themselves in the marketplace. 40 The expansion of the police power in West Coast Hotel signalled a critical theoretical shift, amounting to a rejection of the Lochner Court's conception of the appropriate baseline. The key lies in the notion that failure to act would amount to "a subsidy for unconscionable employers." The idea that what appears, in the Lochner framework, to be government "inaction," or neutrality, might amount to a subsidy is at first glance quite puzzling. The Court's claim is that the failure to impose a minimum wage is not nonintervention at all but simply another form of action-a decision to rely on traditional market mechanisms, within the Holmes, A Dissenting Opinion-The Speech Cases, 36 Stan. L. Rev. 1349 ( 
U.S. 426 (1917); Muller v. Oregon, 208 U.S. 412 (1908). 
at 397-98. 

power was by no means precisely defined. common law framework, as the basis for regulation. 41 West Coast Hotel rests on an understanding that in any case, government-through minimum wage laws or the common law system-is making a choice. The common law could not be regarded as a natural or unchosen baseline. The traditional treatment of the police power was unable to survive this understanding. 42 For the Court in West Coast Hotel, the baseline for analysis was instead a system in which all workers had a living wage. 
Similar developments occurred in other areas of the law. Consider for example, the law of eminent domain, with which Lochner must be closely associated: both involved perceived "takings" from A to B, and an underlying framework built on common law baselines.4 3 Miller v. Schoene 44 tested the constitutionality of a statute requiring the destruction of ornamental cedar trees infected with a disease damaging to local apple orchards. The owners of the cedar trees complained that the statute amounted to a "taking" of their property for which compensation was constitutionally required. The Court responded that "the state was under the necessity of making a choice between the preservation of one class of property and that of the other wherever both existed in dangerous proximity. It would have been nonetheless a choice if, instead of enacting the present statute, the state, by doing nothing, had permitted serious injury to the apple orchards within its borders to go unchecked. When forced to such a choice the state does not exceed its constitutional powers by deciding upon the destruction of one class of property in order to save another .... -45 This was so notwithstanding the fact that the injury at issue was not tortious at common law. In Miller as in West Coast Hotel, adherence to common law baselines no longer seemed neutral, and departures from those baselines were no longer impermissibly partisan. The same phenomenon occurred under the contracts clause, as the Court expanded the range ofjustifications that would allow the state to assert its "police power" in order to abrogate private agreements. 4 6 In these circumstances it should be unsur41. Here the parallel to the affirmative action debate is especially striking. See infra notes 113-17 and accompanying text. 
( 
Why this change should have occurred is a complex matter. In part, the Depression was responsible; in a period of widespread poverty and unemployment, it became harder to see nineteenth century market ordering as in the interest of all. In part, the partial but increasing use of government power to alleviate suffering made the common law system seem less and less natural and inviolate. See id. Consider in this regard Franklin Roosevelt's suggestion: "We must lay hold of the fact that economic laws are not made by nature. They are made by human beings." 1 Public Papers of Franklin D. Roosevelt 657 (1938). 
prising that Erie v. Tompkins, 4 7 the principal case recognizing the constructed rather than prepolitical character of the common law, was decided only one year after West Coast Hotel. 
We may thus understand Lochner as a case that failed because it selected, as the baseline for constitutional analysis, a system that was state-created, hardly neutral, and without prepolitical status. Once the Court's baseline shifted, its analysis became impossible to sustain. As every student of the law of torts is aware, one cannot treat as a "taking" from A to B a decision to transfer resources to which A had no entitlement in the first place. The whole notion of "taking" depends on a belief in an antecedent right to the property in question. 48 Once the common law itself was seen to allocate entitlements and wealth, and the allocation seemed controversial, a decision to generate a new pattern of distribution could not be for that reason impermissible. 
The defect of the Lochner era might, then, be understood in three ways that are closely related but that have some significant differences as well. In its narrowest form, the problem was the Court's decision to take market ordering under the substantive standards of the common law as the baseline from which to decide constitutional cases.4 9 In this formulation, the difficulty lay in the use of the common law as the starting point from which to administer the critical line distinguishing action from inaction and partisanship from neutrality. More broadly, the Lochner Court regarded consideration of "whose ox is gored"-when those helped were the disadvantaged-as impermissible partisanship; consideration of the plight of the disadvantaged was insufficiently public or general and not neutral at all. This conclusion, reflecting a kind of legal formality, turned out to depend on the antecedent selection of a baseline grounded in the common law. More broadly still, the Court took as natural and inviolate a system that was legally constructed and took the status quo as the foundation from which to measure neutrality.50 The use of the status quo as the foundation for measurement is of course different from similar use of the common law. We shall see both uses in the discussion to follow. 
These three understandings are closely related to one another. The decision about what is partisanship and what is neutrality depends 
Inalienability: One View of the Cathedral, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1089 ( Utility, and Fairness: Comments on the Ethical Foundations of "Just Compensation" Law, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 1165 (1967). 
used interchangeably throughout; the reference is to the allocation of rights of use, ownership, transfer, and possession of property associated with "laissez-faire" systems and captured in the common law of the late nineteenth century. Of course common law systems have not always taken this form, and market ordering could take place under dramatically different allocations of entitlements. 
on the baseline used for measurement; thus the second defect presupposes some variation on the first. The third understanding, stressing use of the status quo, is in turn simply a generalization of the Lochner Court's treatment of the common law. For better or worse, these understandings of the Lochner era treat judicial activism as a secondary concern. The central problem of the Lochner Court had to do with its conceptions of neutrality and inaction and its choice of appropriate baseline. 
This understanding of Lochner is hardly uncontroversial, but variants have been offered. 5 1 And ifLochner is understood in these terms, it has not been entirely overruled. Numerous decisions, in widely disparate areas of constitutional law, depend on Lochner-like baselines and similar principles of neutrality and inaction; one or more of the understandings of Lochner set above are reflected in many areas of current law. The areas to be covered span a wide range, including affirmative action, campaign finance regulation, gender discrimination, the state action doctrine, the distinction between de facto and de jure discrimination, and judicial review of inaction by federal administrative agencies. The discussion begins with areas using common law baselines and later shifts to areas in which the status quo is the foundation for decision. 
It is important to understand that for present purposes, the goal is descriptive rather than normative. To say that a decision depends on Lochner-like premises is not to say that it was wrong. The normative issue is dealt with below. 
attack on campaign finance regulation. The regulation at issue im51. See B. Ackerman, Reconstructing American Law ( 42, at 427-55; Kennedy, Form and Substance in Private Law Adjudication, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1685 (1976); MacKinnon, Pornography, Civil Rights, and Speech, 20 Harv. C.R.C.L. L. Rev. 1 ( 
Similar points were made by the legal realists. See Cohen, Property and Sovereignty, 13 Cornell L.Q. 8 (1927); Hale, Coercion and Distribution in a Supposedly NonCoercive State, 38 Pol. Sci. Q.470 (1923). 
understanding of the Lochner era, or of any other period, ought to be accepted. Of course the primary requirement is that the understanding be true to the decided cases-certainly in terms of result, and, it is to be hoped, in terms of the rhetoric as well. But among conflicting understandings that fit the cases equally well, the choice has an inescapable normative dimension. R. Dworkin, Law's Empire 90-98 ( implications of the approach set out here and the more conventional understanding, see infra notes 167-205 and accompanying text. 
posed a ceiling on campaign expenditures by candidates and political parties. In defense of the regulation, the government argued that it sought to equalize the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcomes of elections. Disparities in wealth, the government claimed, enabled some to drown out the voices of others. Restrictions on the speech of the wealthy served the interest of "dissemination of information from 'diverse and antagonistic sources.' -53 By equalizing participation in the political realm, campaign finance regulation, it was said, did not undermine but instead promoted first amendment interests. 
In Buckley, the Court concluded that this justification for regulation was illegitimate. In the Court's words, "the concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment."'5 4 The effort at equalization was not within the permissible ends of government. As far as the first amendment is concerned, the state must take disparities in wealth, and the existence of some with more "voice" than others, as part of nature for which government bears no responsibility. To do otherwise was, for the Buckley Court, a kind of first amendment "taking." 
Buckley is a direct heir to Lochner. In both cases, the existing distribution of wealth is seen as natural, and failure to act is treated as no decision at all. Neutrality is inaction, reflected in a refusal to intervene in markets or to alter the existing distribution of wealth. Buckley, like Lochner, grew out of an understanding that for constitutional purposes, the existing distribution of wealth must be taken as simply "there," and that efforts to change that distribution are impermissible. Under both cases, the category of permissible legislative ends was sharply limited. To be sure, Buckley was a construction of the first amendment, whereas Lochner rested on the due process clause; and that distinction may turn out to be important. 55 But whether or not Buckley was rightly decided, it has much in common with Lochner. 
B. 
The due process clause accords procedural protection to "liberty" and "property," terms that the Court has had some difficulty defining in recent years. 56 The principal problems have arisen in deciding which, if any, statutory benefits-those said to be "conferred by the 1987] goverment"-are entitled to procedural protection. 5 7 For a long period the Court concluded that some benefits were "created" by the government, whereas other benefits were not. Only the latter-generally interests protected by the common law-were entitled to procedural protection. In the wake of an assault on this position, rejecting Lochnerlike baselines deriving from common law,58 the Court has apparently concluded that statutory benefits will sometimes be considered "liberty" or "property"- but only when there is a statutory entitlement, defined as a limitation on the administrator's discretion to provide the benefit in question. 59 
Lochner-like premises powerfully influence this debate. For the most part, liberty and property are defined by reference to the common law.60 Interests protected at common law-including most prominently the right to private property, the right to bodily integrity, and other rights protected in the Lochner era-are axiomatically entitled to protection. The difficulties arise with other sorts of rights, including the right to freedom from discrimination, the right to government employment, and the right to welfare. The statutory entitlement approach is based on a partial rejection of Lochner-era understandings. But the Court's failure to put benefits said to be created by the government on the same footing with benefits said to be "natural" is a clear holdover from the Lochner period. The distinction itself treats the common law as unchosen and statutory benefits as a form of "intervention"-the same choice of baseline that affected the Lochner Court. An alternative approach would have been to select liberty and property interests by reference to some criterion of importance independent of the common law, or at least not determined by common law categories. 6 1 Similar issues have arisen as a matter of substantive due process. In Flemmingv. Nestor,6 2 the Court concluded that social security benefits were not constitutionally protected "property. ' 6 3 The same conclusion has been reached elsewhere, as courts have concluded that government may eliminate benefits of its own creation-where that notion is defined by reference to the common law.64 The failure to accord substantive protection to statutory benefits derives from Lochner era distinctions between common law interests and other benefits. Similarly, the constraints of Article III have been administered under Lochner-like premises. The Court is less likely to require an Article III tribunal when a right created by Congress is at stake. The common law thus defines a large amount of the territory captured by Article III requirements.6 5 
The state action doctrine is a product of an (uncontroversial) understanding that the Constitution is directed to acts of government rather than acts of private individuals. But how does one decide whether government is "acting"? The legal test could in theory depend on whether government agents are involved in the process. But as the dispute provoked by such cases as Shelley v. Kraemer6 6 makes clear, such a test would be inadequate. State officials are involved in the enforcement of private contract, tort, and property law every day, and their involvement does not subject all private arrangements to constitutional constraints. Instead, state action doctrine has always depended on a baseline establishing the legitimate or at least ordinary functions of government. And in setting forth such a theory, and using it as the basis of inquiry, courts have not merely searched for state "action," but instead relied on common law baselines like those in Lochner. 
For example, the Constitution is frequently said to be a charter of "negative" rather than "positive" rights. 67 This understanding can be found in a number of areas of state action doctrine. When the government fails to provide protection against private racial discrimination, the failure is said not to be "state action" and thus raises no constitutional question. 68 Nongovernmental discrimination is created by the private rather than the public sphere. So too, no constitutional ques1987] tion is raised when private property owners deny the public access to their property. As the Court held in Hudgens v. NLRB, 69 the first amendment is not violated when landowners invoke state trespass law in order to prevent picketers from displaying their messages on private lands. All of these issues are resolved by the choice of a Lochner-like baseline of government "inaction," one that appears neutral and natural. Neither enforcement of the trespass law nor repeal of laws forbidding private discrimination is taken as state action-a conclusion that relies upon common law notions about the role of government. 
But consider PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins.70 That case involved a decision by the California Supreme Court extending rights of free speech, under the state constitution, so as to permit people to picket on privately owned shopping centers. The shopping center owners invoked the due process and takings clauses as a bar to the abrogation of their property rights, as those rights had been understood before the California court's decision. The Supreme Court upheld the abrogation, but left no doubt that the partial abrogation of the state law of trespass was "state action" sufficient to call for constitutional scrutiny. Indeed, a fair reading of the opinion is that some abrogations of state trespass law would amount to an unconstitutional taking-a conclusion that should be unexceptionable. Property rights are defined by state law. Abrogation of trespass law, either with respect to particular persons or across-the-board, is ordinarily the central meaning of a taking of property. 
Why did the abrogation of trespass law in PruneYard appear uncontroversially to be state action, while application of the same law was understood to be no such thing in Hudgens? Indeed, which case involved "action," and which "inaction"? At first glance, the invocation of a trespass law might seem more plausibly to be action than the abrogation or removal of the very same law. The cases confirm that the state action inquiry is not a search for whether the state has "acted," but instead an examination of whether it has deviated from functions that are perceived as normal and desirable. And that examination is powerfully influenced by the common law; thus it is the abrogation rather than the enforcement of a trespass law that appears to be state action. The baseline, in short, has been defined in terms that are reminiscent of that in Lochner. 
It will be useful to return to the treatment of private racial discrimination. There is general agreement, at least in the courts, 71 that no constitutional question is raised if a state fails to provide protection Horowitz, Reitman v. Mulkey: A Telophase of Substantive Equal Protection, 1967 Sup. Ct. Rev. 39. 

(relating Reitman to an "expanding concept" of equality and state responsibility). from private racial discrimination, or if a state repeals a statute that had provided such protection. This understanding is made explicit in one of the most vexing of modem state action cases, Reitman v. Mulkey. 72 At issue in Reitman was a California constitutional amendment providing that no state statute may be enacted that interferes with the private right to sell property to whomever the property owner chooses. By a five-to-four vote, the Court invalidated the amendment on the ground that its purpose and effect were to encourage private racial discrimination. But the Court was careful to emphasize that the amendment stood on a very different footing from a "mere" failure to provide protection against private racial discrimination. 73 For purposes of the Constitution, PruneYard appeared an easy case, and the failure to provide protection against trespass was obviously state action; whereas Reitman was quite difficult, and the failure to provide protection against racial discrimination was obviously not state action. What accounts for this? 
The answer lies in the fact that the search for state action can be made coherent only against a background normative theory of the legitimate or normal activities of government. Without such a theory, the search is unguided. It is only because of the persistence of Lochner-like theory that state action was uncontroversially at stake in PruneYard but difficult to find in Reitman v. Mulkey. 74 In PruneYard, there was a deviation from the common law baseline. In a case in which the state fails to provide protection against racial discrimination, or enforces the law of trespass, there is not. In state action doctrine, as in the Lochner period, the common law provides the benchmark from which to measure intervention. 
For the last two decades there has been considerable debate about the existence of affirmative rights against government. 75 The conventional wisdom, 76 referred to above, has it that the Constitution is a charter of negative guarantees-rights against government interference-and that "affirmative" rights are exceptional or nonexistent. Thus it is said that government may not intrude on private rights, but there is no claim against the government if it has failed to act. The basic position has resulted in rejection of claims to various public serv1987] ices, ranging from police protection to welfare. Perhaps the most wellknown example is Harrisv. McRae,77 in which the plaintiffs challenged the government's failure to fund abortions needed by poor women. The Court held that government had no duty to remove barriers "not of its own creation."' 78 The idea is that poverty is simply "there"; it is not a product of government action. By now it should be easy to see that this idea depends on Lochner-like definitions of neutrality, inaction, and appropriate baselines. 
There is, however, a peculiarity in the notion that the Constitution does not guarantee "affirmative rights." We have seen that the takings clause protects against repeals, partial or total, of the trespass laws. When a state abrogates the law of trespass, it is removing what might be seen as "affirmative" protection; but its action does not become for that reason constitutionally acceptable. The protection of private contracts can be understood in similar terms. The contracts clause amounts to a right to state enforcement of contractual agreements; if the state fails to protect by refusing to enforce a contract, it is violating the clause. 
Here and elsewhere, it is misleading to understand the Constitution solely as a guarantor of "negative" rights. The Constitution protects some rights and not others. Whether rights are treated as "negative" or "positive" turns out to depend on antecedent assumptions about baselines-the natural or desirable functions of government. State protection of private property and contract appears to be a "negative" guarantee because it is so usual, indeed built into the very concepts of property and contract. 79 Provision of welfare is treated differently because it is in some respects new and in any event hedged with limitations and reservations. Here Lochner's premises, having to do with neutrality and inaction, account critically for current constitutional doctrine with respect to "affirmative" rights. 
All this sheds some light on claims of a constitutional right to "affirmative" protection. Viewed through the lens of the Lochner period, claims for "positive rights" cannot be dismissed by reference to the "negative" character of constitutional guarantees or the word "deprive" in the fourteenth amendment. Whether there is a deprivation depends on antecedent conceptions of entitlement; if there were a preexisting right to welfare, the failure to provide it would in fact be a deprivation. In these circumstances one might argue that there have always been constitutional rights to certain kinds of positive guarantees, and that in the modern era the right to a minimal level of material goods, like the right to protection against trespass, has constitutional status. In mature form, this argument would be quite elaborate, and for present purposes it is unnecessary to say whether the argument might be made persuasive.8 0 It should suffice to suggest that cases rejecting so-called "affirmative" rights depend on Lochner-like premises. 
The most conspicuously Lochner-like provisions in the Constitution are the contracts and takings clauses, especially in their incorporation of the status quo and of common law principles. The takings clause, protecting private property, provides the analytical foundations for Lochner itself. And it is hard to read the provision without accepting, at least to some degree, certain premises about neutrality, inaction, and common law baselines. The contracts clause protects a species of private property; it thus grows out of the same framework as Lochner. But in the last fifty years, the constraints of the contracts and takings clauses have been significantly curtailed, in part for the same reasons that led to the abandonment of Lochner itself. These developments suggest, among other things, that text and animating purposes have been far from central to decisions about whether to rely on Lochner-like principles. 
The decline of the contracts clause has been a subject of increasing modern controversy. The clause provides that no state shall enact any law "impairing the obligations of contracts." For a long period the clause operated as a significant barrier to government action; the clause is now for the most part8 l a dead letter. How might this development be explained? 
The answer lies in the dramatic expansion of the police power-in short, from an understanding based on Lochner to one rooted in West Coast Hotel. For a long period the contracts clause has permitted states to abrogate contracts so long as they are operating within the "police power." If a state bans the sale of heroin, and the ban applies retroactively to prevent enforcement of a contract, there is no constitutional problem.8 2 The reserved powers of the state, it is said, operate as an implicit limitation on the power to contract. But if the police power is understood in Lochner-like terms, there is still enormous room for immunity from legislative interference-a claim demonstrated by the interpretation of the contracts clause for much of the nation's history.8 3 
the police power very broadlyv-thus replicating the outcome in West Coast Hotel and rendering the contracts clause functionally identical to the due process clause. 
Similar developments occurred under the law of eminent domain. Here Lochner-like premises might be expected in two places: the interpretation of the "public use" requirement and of the police power exception to the compensation requirement. The public use requirement traditionally meant that the property had actually to be used by the public.8 5 But gradually the requirement was expanded to refer to any plausible public justification, including those that are redistributive in character.8 6 Thus it is said that the public use requirement has been rendered effectively unenforceable, much like the rationality requirement of the due process clause post-Lochner. 
Moreover, the police power exception to the eminent domain clause immunizes various regulatory measures from constitutional attack, even if they diminish the value of property. An actual physical invasion of property is often a prerequisite for a finding of a "taking." 8 7 All this is a product of an abandonment of Lochner-like baselines. It would be difficult, however, to abandon those baselines altogether without reading the contracts and takings clauses out of the Constitution; in nature, those provisions are Lochner-like, though their scope is uncertain.8 8 The narrowing of the scope of the contracts clause has almost converted it into a constitutional redundancy; the takings clause is still important in the context of physical invasions. 
One of the most important issues in modern administrative law is whether inaction by administrative agencies, defined as the failure to enforce regulatory statutes, should be subject to the same standards as administrative action, defined as regulatory enforcement. Under the traditional approach, agency action is subject to a strong presumption of reviewability.89 Much of administrative law grows out of an undersuch harms as constitutionally troublesome would hardly seem odd. Doctrine based on compensatory goals would be a permissible and perhaps mandatory course. 
facto segregation was a cause for constitutional concern.1 20 De facto segregation, largely in the North, is said to arise from the voluntary choices of blacks and whites; de jure segregation is the product of law. But here, as in the case of affirmative action, the terminology itself rests on Lochner-like premises. The notion of de facto segregation suggests that segregation simply happened; it is "just there." But if the existence of patterns of segregation were seen as an outgrowth of the legacy of racial discrimination, an attack on "de facto" segregation might have been more plausible. There may be good reasons to immunize some kinds of segregation from legal control, but the doctrinal distinction depends partly on understandings of neutrality and inaction that are close cousins of Lochner. 
In the last two decades, the Court has given "heightened scrutiny" to discrimination against women, invalidating a wide range of statutes. Sometimes the Court invalidates statutes because they are based on inaccurate stereotypes. 1 2 ' But the difficult cases arise when the Court faces measures reflecting differences that are in some sense real. Consider, for example, Califano v. Goldfarb,122 involving a statute allowing spouses of men automatically to qualify for social security benefits, but requiring spouses of women to establish dependency; Craigv. Boren,1 23 invalidating a law prohibiting boys from drinking alcoholic beverages until age twenty-one, but allowing girls to drink at age eighteen; Mississippi Universityfor Women v. Hogan,124 involving a nursing school limited to women; and Rostker v. Goldberg,125 upholding a law requiring men but not women to register for the military draft. In all of these cases, the statute under attack responded, albeit sometimes crudely, to differences between men and women that were in some sense real. On what basis did the Court invalidate the first three measures? 
to statistics showing that boys tended to be cited for drunk driving more often than girls, said that statistical demonstrations are "intension with the normative philosophy that underlies the Equal Protection 558-59, 567-75 ( 
Reed, 404 U.S. 71 ( 

1987] Clause."1 26 In all of these cases, the differences, even if "real," are not simply there, but are at least to some degree' 27 artifactual: a product of cultural forces, including the legal system, that have created and perpetuated differences between the sexes. Thus in Goldfarb, the fact that men tend to be wage-earners more often than women was not treated as exogenous to the legal system. Indeed, the fact was reinforced as such, even if in a minimal way, by the very statute in Goldfarb, which made the package of benefits more attractive for men than for women and tended to make it more desirable for men to work. Thus in the Hogan case, the Court said that the statute at issue "makes the assumption that nursing is a field for women a self-fulfilling prophecy."' 128 
Rostker is a striking contrast. There the Court reasoned that since Congress had excluded women from combat, the difference in registration requirements responded to "real differences" between men and women. But those real differences were a product of law; it was a statute that created them. Rostker is in this sense reminiscent of a wide range of earlier cases failing to recognize the constructed character of gender distinctions and upholding discrimination because of a perception that subordination of women was a part of nature. 129 
With the exception of Rostker, the cases under discussion derive from a partial rejection ofLochner-like principles that would take gender differences as exogenous variables, and would understand neutrality to lie in reasonable responses to those differences. 130 To this extent, the 
degree gender differences have a biological component. Even if there is such a component, it hardly justifies the measures at issue in most cases; it is by no means clear that the legal system should turn biological differences into social disadvantages. The point here is that Lochner-like reasoning would take gender differences as a proper basis for legal differentiation, no matter their source, and that some of the current law of gender discrimination is opposed to such reasoning. Cf. C. MacKinnon, Feminism Unmodified (1987) (discussing ways in which legal system naturalizes discrimination against women). 
The second problem lies in deciding when something is artifactual or not. A strong view of the lesson of the Lochner period is that everything is-precisely because government decisions not to change matters are, after all, decisions. In this view, qualifications of the sort in the text-suggesting that gender differences, poverty, and the distribution of benefits and burdens along racial lines are "partly" a product ofthe legal system-are unnecessary and misleading. Such qualifications themselves import Lochner-like premises. 
prejudice is "the lens that distorts reality," an understanding that depends on the premise that there is a prepolitical reality that law should reflect. See C. MacKinnon, Feminism Unmodified 40-42 (1987). 
Note, however, that in Rostker the plaintiffs had conceded the legality of the combat restriction, so the Court's conclusion was perhaps defensible in context. 
racial differences might justify racist classifications). See also the discussion of rape in Estrich, Rape, 95 Yale LJ. 1087 ( State: Toward Feminist Jurisprudence, 8 Signs 635 (1983). law of gender discrimination is an outgrowth of ideas that abandon the status quo as a neutral baseline and instead rely on a baseline of gender equality operating to some extent as a criticism of the existing order. But many areas of the law of gender discrimination share Lochner-like premises. Consider, in addition to the Rostker decision, cases finding discriminatory effects insufficient for constitutional invalidation;' 3 1 decisions permitting employers to exclude fertile women from employment when actual or potential fetuses may be endangered;13 2 and Michael M. v. Sonoma County Superior Court,133 upholding distinctions in age for statutory rape. Above all, cases involving discrimination on the basis of actual or potential pregnancy, or control of reproductive functions, are Lochner-like to the extent that they turn differences that are often regarded as natural into legal disadvantages.' 3 4 In this sense, Roe v. Wade itself might be seen as profoundly anti-Lochnerinsofar as it accorded to women the power to make a decision that it had been previously thought was not theirs because of nature.1 3 5 
To say that such cases treat gender differences as real, when the social and legal meaning of those differences is a decision of the legal system, is not necessarily to say that they were wrongly decided.13 6 But it is to suggest that they depend on Lochner-like premises about neutrality. 
Both public and private law generally take private preferences as the appropriate basis for social choice. In private law, paternalism tends to be disfavored,' 3 7 and the most well-known conceptions of public law understand the purpose of legislation to be the aggregation 
1987] of private preferences.' 3 8 To this degree, preferences are treated in Lochner-like fashion as exogenous variables; and legal interferences with those preferences are generally thought to be partisan and illegitimate. The processes of preference formation and the-possibility of distorting factors are generally not a subject for legal inquiry. 13 9 
Sometimes, however, constitutional courts conclude that preferences are a product of some kind of distortion. Consider, for example, the constitutional hostility to freedom-of-choice plans as a remedy for school segregation. 140 At first glance it is hard to see why such plans should be objectionable, for they allow blacks and whites to send their children to whatever schools they prefer. If the result is continuing segregation, the problem might be thought to lie in private choices rather than in the legal system. 
The Court's hostility to such plans depends at least in part on a conclusion that the preferences of whites and blacks are distorted by the history of discrimination. 14 Blacks may prefer not to send their children to predominantly white schools because of a fear of racial hostility and antagonism. Whites may be reluctant to send their children to black schools because of racial prejudice brought about at least in part through law. In these circumstances, the preferences are not simply "there" and to be taken as natural; they are a result of legal structures, and remedial measures must take that into account. 
A similar issue is raised by Palmore v. Sidoti,14 2 in which the Court invalidated a child custody plan giving preferences to parents of the same race as the child. The Court said that the state may not sanction racial prejudice through law, but it is unclear why the Constitution should forbid government from taking into account the reality of private racism. Here too the answer depends on a perception that racism is not simply exogenous; it is a product of public and private choices and is properly subject to legal remedy. The same considerations apply in the area of gender. What emerges is therefore a system that generally treats preferences as exogenous and a proper basis for social choice, but that in certain limited contexts 143 concludes that preferences reflect relations of power brought about by, among other things, the legal system itself. 
III. ABANDONING LOCHNER 
We have seen that Lochner has many progeny in modern constitutional law.' 4 4 Sometimes, as in Buckley and Wygant, Lochner-like premises are used as a basis for invalidating government measures. 
that sort are used in order to uphold such measures. Nor is the problem limited to constitutional provisions protecting individual rights. The structural provisions of the Constitution were designed partly to protect private property and liberty from government incursion. 14 5 The rise of the modem administrative state is based largely on a perception that aggressive governmental action, repudiating the common law, has become necessary. 14 6 One of the most important tasks of modem constitutional theory is to implement the original purposes of the structural provisions in a time when traditional conceptions of limited government have been repudiated. 14 7 
analytic connection to Lochner is only descriptive, and it does not necessar143. The limitation derives from a fear that if the legal system is generally permitted to intervene whenever preferences are "distorted," lines will become difficult or impossible to draw and the range of permissible interventions will be limitless.

in the notion that "statutes in derogation of the common law should be narrowly construed," but in more modern approaches as well. See, e.g., Easterbrook, Statutes' Domains, 50 U. Chi. L. Rev. 533 (1983), which amounts to an argument that when there are statutory "gaps," courts should resolve all doubts in favor of market ordering. See also Macey, Promoting Public-Regarding Legislation Through Statutory Interpretation: An Interest Group Model, 86 Colum. L. Rev. 223 ( by reference to departures from the common law). An important task is to develop 1987] ily argue for doctrinal change. Indeed, it would be difficult to imagine a constitutional system that did not have some premises in common with Lochner. The framers themselves shared those premises, and versions can be found at every stage of American constitutionalism. But the argument for Lochner-like premises is conceptual as well as historical. It is hard to escape Lochner in thinking about this or any other legal system; its premises are built into our language itself.148 Without some foundations or baselines from which to make measurements, legal analysis cannot go forward, and in some cases it is hard to dispute that understandings like those reflected in the common law or the status quo are the appropriate baseline. The point is buttressed by the fact that in any legal system, one should hope for some degree of continuity over time. The current system owes its foundations to the common law. It would be most surprising, and probably undesirable, to find those foundations entirely abandoned.' 4 9 
But Lochner was wrongly decided, and one of the reasons that it was wrong is that it depended on baselines and consequent understandings of action and neutrality that were inappropriate for constitutional analysis. The New Deal to a large degree rejected those understandings, and the rejection has only partly found its way into law. Which, if any, of current doctrines should be abandoned for the same reason? How should constitutional law proceed if it is to escape its roots in Lochnerlike reasoning? It is difficult to answer these questions in the abstract; whether and how Lochner-like premises should be rejected is too large a question to discuss as a whole. This section ventures some thoughts on the relevant inquiries. 
The Lochner Court chose the status quo, as reflected in market ordering under the common law system, as the baseline for measurement of departures from neutrality and of action and inaction. There are approaches to statutory construction that are not based on hostility to departures from common law categories. 
The same view is reflected in approaches to administrative law that distinguish between the rights of statutory beneficiaries and those of regulated class members. See Scalia, Vermont Yankee: The APA, the D.C. Circuit, and the Supreme Court, 1978 Sup. Ct. Rev. 345 (suggesting that ordinary concerns supporting procedural safeguards do not apply when statutory beneficiaries are the complainants); Smith, Judicialization: The Twilight of Administrative Law, 1985 Duke L.J. 427 (suggesting that the principal concern of administrative law is the protection of private property).

About the Mind (1987). 
1599-1605 ( often good reasons to abandon that baseline, at least as a general rule.15 0 The common law is not prepolitical; its conception of the function of the state has been repudiated by the political branches of government, and for good reasons. Constitutional and statutory interpretation is properly informed by this repudiation.15 1 Efforts to change the common law framework are not by virtue of the fact constitutionally suspect, and measures that respect that framework are not "inaction" necessarily to be immunized from legal scrutiny. Use of the status quo as a baseline is.sometimes objectionable for similar reasons. Consider the fact that discrimination on the basis of race is responsible for the existing distribution of benefits and burdens along racial lines. 
If the baseline provided by the common law or the status quo is abandoned, there are two principal alternatives. One possible response to the decline ofLochner would be to conclude that constitutional courts ought to play little or no role in deciding whether the existing distribution of wealth and entitlements should be changed. Associated with one strand in the New Deal but presaged by Holmes' Lochner opinion, this view appears prominently in Learned Hand's lectures on the Bill of Rights, 152 James Landis' work on administrative law, 153 and the opinions of Justice Frankfurter.' 5 4 
Under the Holmesian view it does not matter, for constitutional purposes, whether the state is reaffirming or rejecting the common law, or whether it is dramatically changing the existing allocation of entitlements and power. The abandonment of common law baselines requires an abandonment of baselines altogether, at least for purposes of constitutional law. Neutrality is not required because it cannot be achieved; all legal categories are socially constructed and irreducibly subjective.' 5 5 Such an approach would mean that the basic terms of social life are for political rather than legal determination.' 56 
Sometimes this view is founded on interest-group pluralism;'5 7 sometimes it is derived from skepticism about the notion of objectivity 5 8s and about distinctions between reason and power.15 9 For those who believe in interest-group pluralism, efforts to ensure neutrality, in the form of public-regarding legislation, ignore the inevitably self-interested character of political behavior. Neutrality, however understood, is thus inconsistent with the very nature of politics. 1 60 The conclusion is that baselines should be rejected for purposes of constitutional law; courts should uphold legislation except in the most extreme cases. For those skeptical about objectivity, neutrality is an unacceptable effort to privilege a position that is itself contingent and likely to reflect some kind of social interest. 16 1 At its most general level, this concern is reflected in a wide range of work questioning the legacy of the Enlightenment.16 2 This position offers obscure guidance for constitutional courts; it counsels a general rejection both of neutrality and of baselines, but at least in some forms, it offers no alternative position from which to decide cases. 
Approaches that follow Holmes and abandon baselines for the purposes of constitutional law, like the approach in Lochner, have the advantage of easy administration; they are reflected in some of current law under the contracts, due process, and takings clauses; and they can claim as well a proper appreciation of democratic values. 163 The Holmesian abandonment of baselines is of course reflected in traditional understandings of the lesson of the Lochner period. The decision whether to accept those understandings is inescapably normative, and the traditional view might be defended on the foregoing grounds. 
In so extreme a form, however, this position is unacceptable precisely because it is based on odd understandings of republicanism 16 4 and of the workings of majoritarianism.165 The Holmesian position would result in a failure to enforce many constitutional provisions that invite judicial use of baselines, sometimes deriving from the common law, and that are self-conscious limits on the ability of government to restructure or to fail to restructure the existing order. Consider the first amendment, the takings clause, the equal protection clause, and the contracts clause, all of which impose limits on governmental power. Moreover, neutrality- understood not as preservation of market ordering or as disregard of past discrimination but as a requirement of a public-regarding justification for legislation-continues to be required, and for good reasons. 166 The Holmesian position, reflected in some traditional thinking about Lochner, would amount to an abandonment of constitutionalism altogether. Its crude and conclusory references to the primacy of electoral politics are insufficient to support that abandonment. 167 
Lochner and the Holmesian alternative, but it would carry with it large 2-3, suggesting that in a Madisonian system majorities are allowed to rule in some areas of life "for no better reason than that they are majorities."

That requirement is the judicial analogue of the requirement of public-regardingness imposed on legislators, and in neither context should it be confused by importation of Lochner-like premises. 
plu1987] problems of its own. That approach would attempt to generate a baseline independent of either the common law or the status quo through some theory ofjustice, to be derived from the language and animating purposes of the text and based to a greater or lesser degree on existing interpretations. Such an endeavor would require a theory of interpretation, a theory of institutional role, and a theory ofjustice. The effort would be the legal analogue to the various efforts in modem political theory to go beyond or replace classically liberal social contract theories. 168 The text would be the foundation for a theory169 that would be independent of common law ordering, or the status quo, and would serve as a basis for evaluating it. Approaches of this sort might treat the Constitution as a unit, reflecting a single overarching theory. For reasons explored below, it would be preferable to proceed provisionby-provision, 170 constructing theories for each constitutional clause and allowing considerable variation among them. Helpful guidance can be found in republican theories of politics, which carry with them substantive constraints 17 1 and whose premises are highly congenial to ralist fashion, does not capture the view of the framers and is not likely to provide desirable outcomes). 
A closely related approach would attempt to cabin judicial discretion by referring to the intent of the framers, the text of the Constitution, or some other limitation on judicial discretion. Such an approach would reflect a belief that because of the problems posed by democratic theory for an aggressive judicial role, constitutional courts ought not to rely on principles of distributive justice at all. See Monaghan, supra note 7, at 374; Easterbrook, supra note 163, at 91, 97.

Such responses point out the difficulties of "applying" the framers' judgments in changed circumstances; the difficulties of deciding at what level of generality "intent" should be read; the problem of ascertaining the framers' intentions with respect to interpretation; the various difficulties faced by majoritarianism in aggregating private preferences; and the fact that it is by no means self-evident that a well-functioning democracy merely reflects constituent preferences. A final position on such matters is of course necessary in order to decide whether the Holmesian understanding of the Lochner period should be accepted in favor of the approach set out here.

17-24 ( the New Deal attack on the common law. 172 A profitable strategy would be to avoid abstraction and to examine particular areas with considerable care.1 73 
Such an approach would force courts to confront the question of why and how the artifactual quality of a particular system is relevant to the legal question. The fact that a practice is artifactual hardly means that it should be changed; and the fact that it is in some sense natural is not necessarily a reason to respect it.' 74 Consider here the area of gender discrimination; it is the legal system that makes relevant any biological difference, and a decision to turn a difference into a disadvantage demands independent support. 75- But a finding that a practice or system is a product of government is relevant in various respects. First, it may suggest that changes should not be regarded as "takings"; the notion of a taking depends on an antecedent baseline, and if the baseline is not natural, one needs an independent reason to respect it. Moreover, if a practice is revealed as simply an adaptation to the status quo, new legal rules will not be futile. Finally, it is sometimes thought that interferences with practices that are an outgrowth of nature infringe on liberty or on some other right. The Lochner era is itself an example, and the areas of race and gender discrimination might be similarly understood. A recognition that the practices in question are artifactual may weaken such objections. The fact that a practice is a creature of government thus removes some arguments for retaining it, though standing by itself, it is hardly a powerful reason to change it. 
Development of a theory of justice that interprets the constitutional text but that is independent of the status quo is extremely difficult. A strong version of anti-Lochner thinking would make it hard to provide foundations from which to begin the inquiry; even theories of distributive justice need to accept some grounds from which to proceed. 176 Such theories must be culturally situated. The notion of a foundational theory existing entirely apart from conventions is likely to be chimerical, and in its own way reflective of Lochner-like premises. If understanding of the common law can thus be criticized on republican grounds, and those grounds tend to replicate the ideas described supra notes 7-8, 39-45 and accompanying text. 
1987] so, the task is instead to be critical of existing practices without pretending to have transcended the particular culture altogether. 177 
One can point to some such efforts in current law. The first amendment prohibitions of discrimination on the basis of point of view and of government preference of particular religions are prominent examples. 178 The law of racial discrimination is a particularly helpful illustration here. Courts have developed theories that permit them to evaluate particular social practices from an independent baseline, one that prohibits intentional discrimination against blacks. Discrimination on the basis of gender, alienage, and illegitimacy is handled in similar terms. The principal effort here is to develop and justify an alternative baseline, and to imagine a world in which the illegitimate or irrelevant considerations were not at work. 
In some areas, this task appears easy, but the setting of school segregation suggests why development of a baseline independent of the status quo is sometimes difficult. For a long period, the controversial questions here had to do with the constitutionality of freedom of choice and other plans in attempting to eliminate the effects of segregation. 179 Freedom-of-choice plans do not significantly reduce segregation, but court-ordered transportation plans, including racial percentages, can hardly be said to be restoring the system to what it would be if discrimination had never taken place. The problem here is to imagine a hypothetical world in which housing patterns and educational choices were unaffected by past discrimination. The search for a status quo ante in the area of school segregation has an arbitrary quality, and sometimes the Court has had to come close to requiring integration in the absence of any other plausible version of a reconstructed system.' 8 0 
The problem is hardly limited to the area of school segregation. It arises in many cases in which courts are asked to reject the status quo as the appropriate baseline. Consider, for example, a decision to allow a showing of discriminatory effects to trigger the equal protection clause. To a greater or lesser degree, such a decision would require courts to imagine what the system of benefits and burdens across the races would look like in a world unaffected by a legacy of racism. Although inquiries of this sort are familiar in some areas of the law, in the present context they would be difficult to anchor; the causal links are so complex that a reconstruction of the past would inevitably rest on uncertain premises. 18 ' The area of gender discrimination poses similar problems. Imagine efforts to see how veterans' preferences or abortion would be treated in a world unaffected by sexism.18 2 
This is not the occasion to set out a general theory of appropriate baselines from which to decide constitutional cases; as we will see, the answer is likely to vary across provisions. It should suffice to suggest that the common law or status quo baseline in Lochner will often be unacceptable; that the existing order should not be regarded as natural or inviolate; that the abandonment of baselines altogether is also unacceptable; and that generation of an independent alternative is sometimes necessary but poses large difficulties of its own. Current law is an amalgam of all three approaches. The primary purpose here is to suggest some of the ingredients in the decision why and when Lochner-like premises should be abandoned. 
An important lesson of the discussion to follow is the need to proceed with some particularity. Abstract or general approaches are unlikely to be helpful here, at least for the foreseeable future.' 8 3 The examination of particular areas is the starting point for extrapolating more general principles. 
Even if the Holmesian approach is rejected, a less extreme version would suggest that in deciding whether Lochner-like premises should be accepted, it is highly relevant whether the Court is permitting government to act or prohibiting it from doing so. Courts might, in short, be inclined to uphold measures defended in terms like those in West Coast Hotel, even as they were disinclined to invalidate legislation under premises derived from either Lochner or West Coast Hotel. Deference to representative processes argues in favor of this result.' 8 4 Under this view, the parallel of modem decisions to Lochner is closest when the general).

MacKinnon, supra note 134 (proposing a test of whether legal rules perpetuate subordination of women); and compare Law, Rethinking Sex and the Constitution, 132 U. Pa. L.

1981). 
distinguishes judicial action from inaction, and makes the distinction turn on whether the Court is forcing dramatic changes in the status quo. Here, however, the inquiry depends on institutional concerns having to do with the role of the judiciary. Court is invalidating democratically-enacted legislation. Even if one rejects the most extreme claims about the undemocratic character ofjudicial review, one might agree that Lochner-like premises should rarely be used to invalidate legislation. 
The argument for upholding the statute in Buckley v. Valeo was therefore quite strong; the case was very close to Lochner itself-unless there is some difference in the nature of the right, an issue taken up below. Similarly, measures calling for "affirmative action," viewed through the lens of the Lochner era, should generally not be thought to raise a serious constitutional issue. When a legislature or other entity enacts an affirmative action program, it should not be treated as operating against a status quo baseline that is in some sense natural or neutral. The current distribution of benefits and burdens along racial lines is an outgrowth of a long history of discrimination. Efforts to eliminate the subordination of blacks can hardly be regarded in the same way as efforts to perpetuate it.185 
Similar considerations apply to redistributive measures enacted under the constracts and taking clauses. Notwithstanding recent criticism under Lochner-like premises, 186 current law under both clauses is generally correct. It permits a wide realm of action for legislatures, an appropriate conclusion in the face of textual ambiguity, the evident desires of the majority, changed circumstances, and the growing scope of the police power.' 87 In all of these contexts, an understanding like that in West Coast Hotel should operate, at least prima facie, as a "shield" against constitutional attacks on legislation, just as it does under the due process clause in the aftermath of Lochner. 
Because of institutional concerns, more difficult questions are raised by the prospect of using West Coast Hotel as a "sword," that is, as the basis for constitutional attacks on existing social structures. In this category can be put the various arguments for a discriminatory effects test under the equal protection clause. So too, some of the arguments in the racial and gender area attempt to use an understanding like that in West CoastHotel as a sword against government. In the same category can be placed the claims for welfare rights. In such cases, the fact that the plaintiff is attacking legislation enacted by a popular majority counts against recognition of the claim.' 88 
All this is hardly to suggest that the issue of swords and shields should control the constitutional question; that would represent a return to Holmesian understandings about thejudicial role and in its own way reflect Lochner-like distinctions between action and inaction. 18 9 But the issue is highly relevant. Constitutional law is often an uneasy mixture of substantive theory and institutional constraint.1 90 The existence of institutional limits on the part of the judiciary forces the courts to limit the scope of substantive constraints on government action. This combination sometimes produces doctrinal awkwardness, but it is hard to think of an alternative. In these circumstances, it is important whether a decision would call for simple validation of a measure enacted by Congress or instead would require courts to undertake significant social change on their own. 
The catalog of Lochner-like premises in modern public law spans a wide range, and it implicates a large number of constitutional provisions, including the contracts, takings, due process, and equal protection clauses as well as the first amendment. But Lochner-like premises are more necessary or appropriate under some provisions than under others. A lawyer's natural reaction to the problem would be to disentangle the various provisions. The interpretive process, informed to a greater or lesser degree by the text and original purposes, might well vary across clauses; different clauses may abandon or include Lochnerlike premises. A theory of constitutional interpretation would of course be necessary to accomplish this task. 
At the most general level, it is possible to understand the original Constitution as having a substantial Lochner-like dimension. Both the institutional and the individual rights provisions of the document were influenced by an understanding of the naturalness of the distribution of property. 19' The Civil War Amendments were at least a partial recognition of the artifactual quality of existing distributions, and subsequent judicial interpretation carried that recognition much further. The various developments associated with the New Deal 192 were a substantial abandonment of the Lochner-like features of constitutionalism, in its institutional and individual rights dimensions. One of the most important tasks of modern constitutional theory is to integrate these various developments into a theory of constitutional interpretation. 
Lochner, under a textual approach, was wrong above all because it was an interpretation of the due process clause. That clause may be

Constitution, 93 Yale LJ. 1013 ( only procedural in character; 193 it may require the government only to show some minimal justification for its decisions; it may not sharply confine the permissible ends of the state. The takings clause, by contrast, was built on a belief in the meaning and importance of private property, and it would be difficult to read that clause in the fashion of West Coast Hotel without reading it out of the Constitution. The same conclusion may be appropriate under the contracts clause. At a minimum, then, the takings and contracts clauses cannot easily be read -to create a constitutional baseline other than that of the status quo; the notion of property itself develops and evolves from common cultural understandings that cannot easily be subject to independent judicial reconstruction.' 94 The eminent domain and contracts clauses are most naturally read to embody Lochner-like premises about neutrality and inaction. 
At the same time, it would be possible to remove both provisions from their foundations in Lochner. In particular, courts might recognize the social construction of property and understand the term "takings" against the backdrop set by independent theories of entitlement and an appreciation of the social functions of private ownership. Such an approach would produce difficult questions ofjudicial authority and competence, but some have argued in favor of an effort of that sort.195 If such an effort is to be made, however, it should proceed slowly and incrementally in light of the history and current interpretation of the clause. 
By contrast to the takings and contracts clauses, the equal protection clause is most easily read as a self-conscious rejection of Lochnerlike premises. The purpose of the clause was, at least to some degree, to break up the system of subordination of blacks; the best interpretation of the clause recognizes that the existing allocation of power among the races is both artifactual and illegitimate, and its purpose is, to a greater or lesser extent, to equalize that allocation. It should not be surprising that insofar as understandings deriving from West Coast Hotel have been used as a sword against government, the equal protection clause has usually been the textual source of decision.

Constitutionally Protected Liberty, 134 U. Pa. L. Rev. 741 ( as a Constitutional Right, 38 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 1097 (1981). rejection of Lochner's premises, just as the takings and contracts clauses are most obviously their constitutional embodiment. 
What of the first amendment? In Buckley itself, the Court suggested that the provision disposed of the issue: the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech prohibits the silencing of some in order to promote the speech of others. But it is much too facile to point to the text of the clause. Whether regulation of powerful private speakers might sometimes promote "freedom of speech" is the question to be decided. There was a powerful argument in Buckley that campaign finance regulation was necessary in order to promote freedom of speech; one could argue that such regulation was closer to being compelled than proscribed.' 96 On the other hand, a wholesale abandonment of Lochner-like premises, requiring courts to look at the content of speech, would wreak havoc with existing first amendment doctrine-as it did earlier in the century with private property under the due process clause. 
Indeed, the central commitment of the first amendment, as currently interpreted, is to neutrality on the basis of content or viewpoint,197 and this commitment has a Lochner-like feature. Issues of substantive power and powerlessness do not enter into the constitutional inquiry. Government must be neutral between those viewpoints that are good and bad, or those speakers that have power and those that have none.1 98 A set of doctrines growing out of West Coast Hotel would repudiate Buckley; efforts to redress the distorting effects of financial contributions can be fit within the police power, especially in light of theories of free speech that grow out of republican conceptions of politics. 199 But doctrines based on West Coast Hotel might also be led to reject the commitment to viewpoint neutrality. 200 Under such an approach, redistributive and paternalistic goals would be permissible under the first amendment. 201 The police power under the first amendment would thus be close to the police power under the fourteenth. Such an approach would permit government to impose a wide range of regulatory restrictions, mostly on the speech of the powerful, in the interest of reassessment of the existing distribution of power. 
problem of deciding who is powerful and who is not is too manipulable and too likely to be skewed by impermissible factors to be the basis for Rev. 189 (1983). 

(1987). Cf. R. Wolff, B. Moore & H. Marcuse, A Critique of Pure Tolerance (1968) (criticizing traditional beliefs in free expression and tolerance). first amendment doctrine. Moreover, there are good reasons to complain about restrictions on the speech of the powerful. Buckley itself was wrongly decided; the principle at issue there might be confined to financial expenditures without endangering the general principle of viewpoint neutrality. 20 2 But it should not be surprising to find Lochnerlike premises in first amendment doctrine. 
All this suggests that some constitutional provisions incorporate Lochner-like premises, others reject them, and still others create difficult interpretive problems. The nature of the provisions will thus be a significant factor in deciding about appropriate baselines. 
Another factor has to do with the reality or perception of a close causal link between identifiable government action and the practice under attack. In the context of welfare, the link between government action and poverty may seem too attenuated to justify a claim of causation; numerous other causal factors play a role. The same conclusion is drawn in the context of de facto segregation. School and housing patterns are affected by many factors, and the relevant legal rules were not in force in the immediate past. The case of discriminatory effects may be similarly understood, for the existence of such effects is the result of a wide range of factors. Consider by contrast the courts' ready acceptance of remedial plans for actual racial discrimination in the recent past by the defendant. Here the link between state action and racially based harm is so tight that causation is unquestionable. Judgments about causation thus play a significant role in the cases. 
This concern, however, imports some Lochner-like premises about action and inaction and is in any event secondary. In the cases under consideration, there is almost always "but for" causation. The causation issue produces difficulties when and because it is hard to imagine a status quo ante. Consider, for example, a claim that de facto segregation is unconstitutional, or even an attack on de jure segregation thirty years ago. To imagine what the system would look like if the conduct under attack had not occurred is necessarily speculative and largely unanchored. This point presents the problem of baseline in another form. 
Judgments about caustion are not based solely on a reconstruction -ofhistory.203 Sometimes the decision is affected by the perceived consequences of finding a causal link.

erty is in some sense a creation of the state. But if it were to follow that welfare was constitutionally guaranteed, the result may be to undermine incentives for productive labor. Another example has to do with discriminatory effects. If such effects were sufficient to produce invalidity, the consequences would be enormous. Affirmative action would be constitutionally mandated. Such a step would impose a severe strain on the judiciary. Moreover, it would impose costs of two kinds. The decision about which discriminatory effects were permissible and why would be enormously complex. Serious strains would be imposed on the judiciary, particularly in the remedial process. 
The utilitarian and other losses-including enforcement problems-of abandoning Lochner are thus relevant to the constitutional inquiry. They will tend to be largest in cases in which other branches of government support the practice under attack. When, for example, Congress has enacted a statute abandoning Lochner-like principles, these considerations are secondary. In such cases the elected branches have decided that the utilitarian losses are properly incurred, and problems of enforcement are minimized. When the elected branches are on the other side, however, those losses and problems are properly taken into account. They are a secondary consideration, buttressing the development of substantive and institutional theories in the wake of 
We have seen that the question whether Lochner-like premises should be abandoned cannot be answered in the abstract. The issue depends on a mixture of substantive, institutional, and interpretive considerations. The substantive problems present issues of distributive justice; the institutional issues present problems of democratic theory; the interpretive questions raise problems of linguistic theory as well as substantive and institutional issues.20 4 In generating a set of constitutional doctrines in the aftermath of Lochner, it is necessary to proceed with considerable caution. No formula is available. But the foregoing discussion suggests some generalizations and examples that may prove helpful here. In Lochner itself, the textual pedigree of the decision was uncertain; and the outcome reached by the Court ran in the face of a powerful and mounting national consensus in the other direction. Similar considerations justify, at least in broad outline, the Court's current approach to the takings and contracts clauses. These provisions are necessarily Lochner-like in character; they cannot be read out of the Constitution, but a generous approach to the police power is appropri204. For some, the three problems, in concert, mean thatjudges must decide cases by reference to the "intent of the framers," or original meaning, or some other purportedly sharp constraint on judicial decisions. That approach is rejected here. See supra note 167 and accompanying text. ate under both provisions. Affirmative action for both race and gender is relatively easy. The measures in question have been adopted democratically; the equal protection clause is a repudiation of Lochner-like principles; utilitarian concerns cannot be said to count powerfully against affirmative action and may argue in favor of validation; the uncertainty of causation is a secondary matter. Judicial review of agency inaction and standing for regulatory beneficiaries are also relatively easy. Here Congress has created and endorsed a broad presumption of reviewability, and most important, review would serve only to vindicate constitutional and statutory provisions as against the executive branch. Some benefits that are the creature of statute should stand on the same footing as common law interests for purposes of both procedural and substantive due process. The rise of hearing rights for beneficiaries of spending programs is therefore appropriate. 20 5 Buckley v. Valeo was decided incorrectly. In the context of financial expenditures, the first amendment need hardly be read in the Lochner-like fashion suggested by the Court. 
The most difficult cases here involve discriminatory effects under the equal protection clause, welfare rights, and some of the state action cases, including those that raise the possibility of a right to protection against private racial discrimination. Viewed through the lens of the Lochner period, these decisions seem incorrect in their reasoning and questionable in their outcomes. All of them depend on premises about the appropriate baseline that were properly rejected during the Lochner period. But as we have seen, there are powerful prudential and institutional considerations that argue in favor of caution. The primary purpose here is not to suggest how such cases should be decided, now or in the near future, but instead to remove one of the props supporting current doctrine and to suggest some of the relevant inquiries. 
CONCLUSION 
The Lochner Court required government neutrality and was skeptical of government "intervention"; it defined both notions in terms of whether the state had threatened to alter the common law distribution of entitlements and wealth, which was taken to be a part of nature rather than a legal construct. Once the common law system came to be seen as a product of legal rules, the baseline from which constitutional decisions were made had to shift. When the Lochner framework was abandoned in West Coast Hotel, the common law system itself appeared to be a subsidy to employers. The West Coast Hotel Court thus adopted an alternative baseline and rejected Lochner era understandings of neutrality and action. 
rights on participatory and dignatory grounds). and more particular conceptions of baseline, neutrality, and action, it has not been entirely overruled. Numerous modem decisions reflect similar understandings. Cases distinguishing between "positive" and "negative" rights are built on Lochner-like premises that take the common law as the baseline for decision. Much of the law of racial discrimination can be understood similarly, though here the baseline is the status quo rather than the common law. The constitutional attack on affirmative action, indeed the very term, suggests that the current distribution of benefits and burdens along racial lines is simply "there." The state action doctrine borrows heavily from common law understandings about the proper role of government. Some of first amendment doctrine, especially that involving campaign financing, is based on similar premises. 
It is one thing to identify Lochner-like premises in current constitutional law; it is quite another to suggest when and how they should be abandoned. One possible approach would be to reject, in the fashion ofJustice Holmes, any baseline as a matter of constitutional law. Under this approach, the distribution of wealth and entitlements would be for political rather than legal determination. But we have seen that such an approach is too crude, for it would spell an end to constitutionalism. If the idea of baselines is to be retained, and if Lochner is at least sometimes to be abandoned, the task for the future is to develop theories of distributive justice, derived from constitutional text and purposes, that might serve as the basis for evaluating any particular practice. 
Whether and how to develop and implement such theories is a mixture of substantive and institutional problems. We have seen that whether Lochner-like premises are used to invalidate or uphold legislation is relevant. Moreover, some provisions are most plausibly understood in Lochner-like terms, whereas others self-consciously reject those premises; consider the equal protection clause. Second-order considerations include whether there is a clear causal connection between identifiable social practices and the harms invoked by the plaintiff. Social consequences, including utilitarian losses, properly play a role in the decision. Development and implementation of an alternative approach that would incorporate those inquiries is a large task indeed. But there is reason to reject several lines of cases that depend on Lochner-like premises, as in the areas of campaign finance regulation, judicial review of agency inaction, gender discrimination, and affirmative action. There is reason as well to raise questions about the reasoning and perhaps the outcome in more difficult areas, involving discriminatory effects and "positive" rights. 
However these questions are resolved, the central issue in numerous areas of the law-involving campaign finance regulation, hearing rights, affirmative action, gender and race discrimination, standing, review of agency inaction, state action, and "positive" rights-is whether there is a constitutional requirement of neutrality that commands pres

Of the numerous writings surrounding the debate over the American Constitution, The FederalistNo. 101 is probably the most important. In that essay, Madison set out the somewhat surprising thesis that a large republic would be better able than a small one to promote traditional republican goals. According to Madison, a small republic would likely be ridden by factional warfare. In a large republic, by contrast, public-spirited representatives would emerge. Such representatives, Madison claimed, would have the wisdom and the virtue to escape parochial pressures and to promote deliberation in government. A large republic would contain so many factions that they would effectively offset each other. The result would be an increased likelihood that the system will be protected against the effects of factionalism and that republican deliberation will actually occur. Interest-group trade offs - the grant of wealth or opportunity to A rather than to B simply because of A's political power would therefore be reduced or eliminated. 
These aspects of The FederalistNo. 10 are highly congenial to many modern readers.2 But other aspects are more controversial.

The diversity in the faculties of men from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of Government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results ....3 And Madison doses the essay by emphasizing the advantages of the proposed constitution in countering "a rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked project." 4 
In this respect, there are powerful antiegalitarian and antidemocratic dimensions in The Federalist No. 10. The insulation of representatives from popular will appears to be intended not only to promote deliberation, but also to protect against popular desires for the redistribution of wealth and entitlements. Indeed, the two themes were merged in much of the thinking of the Framers. Factionalism was sometimes thought to consist precisely in changes in the existing distribution of property., In this sense, constitutionalism was designed partly as a self-conscious check on democracy - a notion that came up frequently in the constitutional convention. 
It is instructive to compare Madison's claims in The FederalistNo. 10 with a discussion by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in accepting the Democratic nomination for the presidency in'1936. Roosevelt said: [l]t was to win freedom from the tyranny of political autocracy that the American Revolution was fought....

The right to adequate medical care; 
The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident and unemployment; [and] 
The right to a good education. 7 
The New Deal understanding of the functions of constitutionalism, embodied in Roosevelt's program for constitutional reform, thus departed dramatically from the original conception. In the New Deal reformulation, constitutionalism was no longer to be regarded as a check on popular demands for the redistribution of wealth and entitlements. On the contrary, constitutionalism was intended to promote at least a certain degree of redistribution. Roosevelt was of course no socialist; he believed strongly in both private property and private industry. His goal was to soften the harsh edges of the economic system, not to overturn it. But a principal purpose of the New Deal was to protect the poor and the disadvantaged from the risks of the marketplace. In the New Deal period, such efforts at protection did not appear to be a product of "faction," or to represent raw interest-group transfers, but were instead a plausible outcome of a deliberative process among citizens and representatives. The point holds even though some of the innovations of the New Deal period turned out to be difficult to defend on economic or noneconomic grounds. 
Thus the insulation of administrative officials from political pressure - a prominent New Deal theme - was designed to allow for a measure of government intrusion on the privileges of powerful private groups. In this respect, Roosevelt's version of constitutionalism endorsed the Madisonian belief in the insulation of political actors from parochial pressures, but to bring about, rather than to prevent, collective action to redistribute resources. 
The refashioning of the constitutional structure during the period of the New Deal sheds considerable light both on the original framework and on current constitutional predicaments. Indeed, the New Deal period furnishes some basis, though partial and indirect, for understandings of the original system that can be roughly associated with the work of Charles Beard - a conclusion that should not be [VOL. 56:114 surprising in light of the fact that Beard was a part of the progressive movement, which provided much of the underpinning of the New Deal. In this essay, I explore some of the central economic commitments of the original constitutional design, not by offering biographical data about the Framers, but by pointing to a number of features of that design and by providing a comparison of the original document with the New Deal reforms. 
During the celebration of the bicentennial, it is important to appreciate not only the achievements of the Constitution's original drafters, but also those of others who have affected the meaning and structure of the Constitution. One need look no further than the founding generation itself for counsel of this sort. It was Thomas Jefferson who asserted that members of the preceding age were "very like the present, but without the experience of the present,", and who criticized those who "look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence, and deem them like the ark of the covenant, too sacred to be touched." 9 Jefferson advised: "Let us ... [not] weakly believe that one generation is not as capable as another of taking care of itself,and of ordering its own affairs.... [T]he dead have no rights."10 Of those who followed this advice, those associated with the New Deal reformulation - above all Franklin Roosevelt - occupy a singularly important place. 
Three basic commitments underlay the original constitutional design. The first was to some form of "limited government," understood in a vaguely libertarian fashion; the second was to a system of checks and balances; the third was to federalism. The three commitments were closely allied. The institutional principles of the system were designed to serve the substantive belief in rights of private property and contract. 
The substantive commitment, reflected in The Federalist No. 10, was to a degree of immunity from government incursions into the private realm - whether those incursions were supported by a minority or a majority. Thus the original Constitution singled out protection of private contract as one of its rare safeguards of substantive rights; and the Eminent Domain Clause, protecting private property, was a prominent feature of the Bill of Rights. It would be a mistake to suggest that the Framers intended to abolish all of what we would currently describe as redistribution of prop8. Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Samuel Kercheval (July 12, 1816), reprintedin THE PORTABLE THOMAS JEFFERSON 552, 559 (M. Peterson ed. 1977). 

erty, but there can be little doubt that their conception of private rights led to deep suspicion about forms of government action that are now taken as unobjectionable. Modern zoning regulation, social security, minimum-wage and maximum-hour provisions, occupational safety and health controls, environmental measures, labor and civil rights laws - all of these would likely have been quite mysterious to the founding generation. 
At the national level, a variety of efforts were made to insulate public representatives from constituent pressures, in the interest of bringing about a kind of deliberative democracy. Modem pluralist or economic theories, understanding the political process as a kind of market among self-interested actors, were thus rejected by the Framers at both the positive and normative levels. Well aware of the risks posed by self-interested private groups, the founding generation sought not to ensure an equilibrium among those groups, but instead to insulate representatives from factions in order to promote the performance of deliberative tasks. Thus the President was to be selected by the electoral college, a deliberative body. The Senate was to be elected indirectly; only members of the House of Representatives were to be elected directly. 
In the premium placed by the Framers on deliberative democracy, it is possible to see the impact of classical republican thought on the constitutional framing - a significant theme of modern historians writing on the founding period. The Framers did not disparage civic virtue, or believe that self-interest was the inevitable motivating force of human behavior. As Hamilton wrote in The FederalistNo. 55, "[a]s there is a degree of depravity in mankind, which requires a certain degree of circumspection and distrust: So there are other qualities in human nature, which justify a certain portion of esteem and confidence."' 1 Thus the Framers emphasized, time and again, their hope and expectation that virtuous leaders would emerge in a national republic. 
In recent years, there have been many efforts to understand the Framers as thoroughgoing modernist skeptics - indeed as forerunners of Chicago-school economists - treating economic self-interest as the basis of political conduct and understanding the task of representatives as the largely mechanical one of translating the political power of various constituents into political outcomes. Such efforts are badly off the mark; they read into the period of the framing something that simply was not there.1 2 
But the Framers did not believe that a system of deliberative representation was sufficient in itself. The system of checks and balances was designed to serve a variety of supplemental functions, providing safeguards in the event of a breakdown in representative processes. That system would, for example, furnish a measure of THE FOUNDER: SOURCES OF THE POLITICAL THOUGHT OF JAMES MADISON at xi-xix (M. Meyers rev. ed. 1981). [VOL. 56:114 protection against factionalism; some groups might be able to usurp the power of one branch, but they would be unlikely to obtain power over all three. At the same time, checks and balances would diminish the risk that rulers might have and act upon interests adverse to those of the ruled - to minimize what we might now call "agency costs." In the words of The Federalist No. 51, "[a]mbition must be made to counteract ambition," and incursions by government restricted.13 Moreover, as Montesquieu suggested, a system of separated powers should naturally produce "a state of repose or inaction."' 4 The result would be to promote stability, to disable the public sphere at least in some respects,' 5 and to protect-the private spheres of property and contract. In this last sense in particular, the institution of checks and balances comfortably coexisted with the substantive understanding underlying the original system. 
The federal system provided an additional set of safeguards. Thus The FederalistNo. 51 understands federalism as a kind of vertical separation of powers, protecting private rights: 
In the compound republic of America, the power surrendered by the people, is first divided between two distinct governments, and then the portion allotted to each subdivided among distinct and separate departments. Hence a double security arises to the rights of the people. The different governments will controul each other; at the same time that each will be controuled by itself."' 6 In this respect, federalism operated in the service of limited government. Under an approach that sees freedom in immunity from governmental restraints, this additional safeguard is highly desirable. 
At the same time, the federal structure provided a set of opportunities for local self-determination. This was an entirely distinct strand in federalist theory. The idea here is that local self-government furnished a vehicle for active citizen participation in a largely commercial republic. The traditional republican goal of local selfdetermination17 was thus promoted through a two-tier set of governing bodies. Madisonian representation at the national level, supplemented by a system of checks and balances, was accompanied by state and local avenues for self-government. The state and national splitting the legislative and executive functions; and an energetic executive was of course a principal purpose of the shift from the Articles of Confederation. 

74 (1986) (discussing the civic-republican tradition of "self-government realized through politics" as the ideal manifestation of freedom). governments were also intended to "controul each other,"' 8 providing a kind of vertical check and balance that would also work to promote liberty. 
Judicial review of course fit comfortably with this system. Insulated actors would check majoritarian excesses, often redistributive or the result of factionalism, and furnish a final set of constraints on the operation of democracy. It was for this reason that the Federalists readily rejected concerns raised by the Anti-Federalists, who were fearful that judicial review would create a "countermajoritarian difficulty" of the kind that has been so prominent in recent constitutional theory. 
What emerges from this brief sketch is a system in which constitutionalism operated as a self-conscious series of checks on the operation of democracy - a system designed to prevent factionalism and self-interested representation, but also to protect the existing distribution of wealth. It is hardly necessary to examine the economic incentives of the Framers, or to attribute to them sinister motives, to agree that one purpose of the original system was to guard a large set of individual rights, including the prerogatives of private property and contract. The structure of the original Constitution itself furnishes powerful evidence for that view. 
Each of the original constitutional commitments traced above is recognizable as part of the modern constitutional structure. But each of them has undergone considerable reformulation since the framing. A principal source of the reformulation is the New Deal, which altered the original system in a number of ways.' 9 First, the preexisting understanding of legal entitlements, with its heavy emphasis on the protection of wealth and property from democratic control, was rejected. For the New Deal reformers, the common law system of private rights was a regulatory system, serving the interests of some at the expense of others; it had no prepolitical status. The Supreme Court's conclusion, in Lochner v. New York, 20 that regulatory measures should be understood as a sort of "taking" from A for the benefit of B depended on a view that the common law was natural and prepolitical.2 1 The very notion of a taking depends on an antecedent theory of entitlement, and the baselines drawn from the common law and the existing distribution of wealth and entitlements underlay pre-New Deal understandings. In West CoastHotel v. Parrish,22 by contrast, the Court stated that the failure to establish minimum wages could be understood as providing a kind of "sub18.

seen as the culmination of a longer period of administrative and institutional development. See S. SKOWRONEK, BUILDING A NEW AMERICAN STATE 288-89 (1982). [VOL. 56:114 sidy for unconscionable employers." 23 This opinion reflected a dramatic shift in the baselines from which legal decisions were made, a shift that upset original understandings about the primacy of property rights. 
The understanding that the common law was constructed rather than natural led to a dramatically different conception of legal entitlements. In the New Deal period, the previous catalogue appeared both over- and underinclusive. Some items that were treated as legally protected rights became subjects for legal intervention. In particular, rights of private property were no longer immunized from state control. To a large degree this understanding derived from a perception that rights of property were not prepolitical but a product of positive law, above all the law of trespass. 24 Because such rights were socially constructed rather than natural, they were permissible objects of legal control. 
At the same time, the New Deal reformation led to a belief that interests that were previously seen as legal gratuities, or more often a product ofprivate charity, should be protected by the legal system. Hence, for example, Roosevelt's "second Bill of Rights." More concretely, the New Deal period resulted in the creation of legal rights in the form of regulatory protection against poverty, unemployment, accident, disease, oppression by employers, and a wide range of related harms. In this system, factionalism was seen not as the redistribution of property rights, but as the insulation of existing practice from collective control. This theme - a dramatic departure from original constitutional principles - played a prominent role throughout Roosevelt's presidency. Some of the New Deal initiatives, particularly in the area of economic regulation, were built on shaky foundations. But the understanding that factionalism could manifest itself in government inaction rather than action and the concern that failure to protect the disadvantaged could itself be a product of interest-group power were fundamental. 
Understandings of this sort had drastic institutional implications. In particular, they led quite naturally to skepticism about the original system of checks and balances and about tripartite government. That system was closely associated with the common law and with the system of laissez-faire, because as we have seen, it "naturally form[ed] a state of repose or inaction. ' 25 The most radical suggestions of the time called for a total abolition of checks and balances in favor of a concentration of power in one entity. Those suggestions 
Coerdion and Distibution in a Supposedly Noncoercive State, 38 PoL. Sc. Q. 470, 471-77 (1923). 
were repudiated, but some of the impetus behind them was reflected in the enthusiasm for an increase in presidential power and for administrative regulation. The result was that the system of tripartite government was substantially altered. Power that was formerly exercised by Congress and by common law courts was concentrated in the presidency.28 Administrative agencies combined traditionally separated functions. In both cases, the goal was to ensure an institutional structure accommodating the belief that national intervention into the economic structure should be facilitated rather than blocked. 
At the same time, original understandings of federalism were significantly altered. The states, it was thought, were too large to provide genuine self-determination. The notion that the states and the federal government should control each other by ensuring a kind of stasis - the idea of vertical separation of powers - seemed perverse. Finally, states had proved themselves ineffectual in dealing with social and economic problems. The depression of the 1930s is of course the critical development here. In the New Deal reformation, it was the presidency, not the states, that was the locus of selfgovernment. In a single stroke, this understanding allied Hamiltonian beliefs in a strong executive with Jeffersonian aspirations for genuine self-determination by the citizenry. 
The New Deal thus produced a radically different constitutional structure, one that sheds considerable light on the purposes and effects of the original framework and on the origins of current constitutional predicaments. During the New Deal period, the original understanding of rights was substantially altered, the system of tripartite government was abandoned, and federalism took a significantly different form. Most modern constitutional controversies arise out of nostalgia for the original framework, on one or more of these fronts, or from concern that the insights of the New Deal period have been taken insufficiently far. 
IV 
This is hardly the place to evaluate the claims made by those skeptical about the New Deal reformulation. We may suggest, however, that the New Deal rejection of the federal system was far too cavalier. The President does not provide an avenue for self-determination by the citizenry, and national solutions have often ignored the need, emphasized by the Framers, for diversity and flexibility in a large republic. There is a continuing need to achieve traditional republican goals of local self-determination, though avenues are not simple to find. Moreover, the New Deal enthusiasm for technocratic government, embodied in the belief in regulatory administration, has proved myopic. Failure in regulatory implementation has been relatively common. In the last twenty-five years, there have thus been efforts on the part of the three constitutionally specified [VOL. 56:114 branches to oversee regulatory performance, and those efforts have often operated in the service of the substantive agenda of the New Deal. 
With respect to the new conception of rights, in some ways the New Deal reformulation did not go far enough. Much of modem law depends on common law or status quo baselines. Most strikingly, common law categories continue to exert a powerful hold on modem administrative law. Consider the definition of liberty and property interests, where the Court distinguishes between benefits created by the government and those said to be simply "given." In the areas of standing27 and reviewability28 the Court continues to treat the beneficiaries of regulatory statutes less generously than regulated class members, in part because the latter, unlike the former, are always able to point to a common law interest. Consider as well the areas of discrimination on the basis of race and sex. Discriminatory effects are constitutionally unobjectionable, affirmative action is seen as constitutionally troublesome, and both of these conclusions depend on the idea that the existing distribution of benefits and burdens as between whites and blacks and men and women should be seen as simply "there." 
However the future may treat the legacy of the original constitutional framework and the New Deal reformulation, an understanding of the 1930s illustrates the variety of possible relationships between constitutionalism and democracy. Historians have recited a large number of reasons for skepticism toward Charles A. Beard's thesis about the relationship between the economic self-interest of the Framers and the Constitution. Beard and his followers were far too crude in this regard, and they undervalued the breadth and the power of central features of the Framers' vision. But the progressive historians were correct in pointing to the central importance of controversial understandings of private property to the original constitutional regime, and the ways in which those understandings have been repudiated in modem political and constitutional thought. In a time in which the nation celebrates the enormous achievements of the drafters of the original document, it is important to remember the accomplishments of others who have played a role in developing the modem constitutional structure. This category includes not merely the most important Justices of the Supreme Court, but a small group of others who have attained the status of constitutional framers - prominent among them Franklin D. Roosevelt.
