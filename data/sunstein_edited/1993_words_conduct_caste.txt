Words,  Conduct,  Caste
Cass R.  Sunsteint

How  do  we  know  what  counts  as  speech  and  what  counts  as
conduct?  When  is  government  disabled  from  regulating  conduct
that is  intended to express  ideas?  What is the  relationship between
constitutional  principles  of  equality  and  constitutional  principles
of  free  expression?  And  how  do  these  questions  bear  on  current
controversies  over  pornography  and  hate  speech?  In  this  Essay,  I
propose  some  answers  to  these  questions.  I  offer  these  general
propositions:

1. As a matter  of history  and principle, the constitutional  com-
mitment  to  equality  should  be understood  as  a prohibition  against
systems  with  caste-like  features.  Courts should  play a cautious role

Harm:  Feminist  Legal  Perspectives  on  Pornography  and  Hate  Propaganda,"  held  at  The
University  of Chicago  Law  School  on March  3-5,  1993; the  purpose of the  presentation  was
to provide  a broad  overview  of legal  questions raised by  controls on hate  speech and  pornog-
raphy.  In  putting  the  presentation  together,  I  draw  on  a several  other  writings,  especially
Cass  R. Sunstein, Democracy and the Problem of Free Expression (Free Press, 1993),  which
puts  the arguments offered  here  in the  context of a much  broader discussion  of the meaning
of the  free  speech  principle.  Related  issues  are  discussed  in  Cass R.  Sunstein,  The Partial
Constitution chs  7-8  (Harvard,  1993).  The  reader  is  asked to  make  allowances  for  an essay
originally  intended  for oral  presentation.

in  eliminating  the  caste-like  features  of  current society;  the job  of
implementation  belongs  mostly to  the  elected  branches  of govern-
ment. Although  speech  is  hardly  the  principal  culprit,  some  forms
of  expression  can  contribute  to  the  maintenance  of  such  systems.
2.  Whether  words  or  not,  symbols  count  as  speech  within  the
meaning of the  First Amendment  if they  are intended  and  received
as  part  of  the exchange  of  ideas.

3.  Whether  words  or  not,  symbols  count  as  "high  value"
speech-regulable  only under  the  rarest circumstances-if  they are
intended  and  received  as  part  of  public  deliberation  about  some
issue. Through  this  distinction, I mean to reassert the line  between
political  speech  on  the  one  hand  and  other  forms  of  communica-
tion  on  the  other.

4.  Even  if they  are  words,  symbols  not  intended  and  received
as  part  of  the  exchange  of  ideas  are  not  protected  by  the  First
Amendment  at all.

5.  Some  speech  does  not merely  cause  but actually  is an  inde-

pendent  unlawful  act.

To  decide  First  Amendment  cases,  these  propositions  are
hardly  enough.  It  is  necessary  to look not  only at whether  and how
"speech"  is  involved,  but  also  at the  means  by which  government
regulates  speech. There  are  three  principal  kinds  of restrictions  on
speech:  viewpoint-based,  content-based,  and  content-neutral.1
Government  cannot  regulate speech  on  the basis  of viewpoint;  that
is,  it  may  not  single  out  for  approval  or  disapproval  a  particular
point  of  view.  Content-based  but  viewpoint-neutral  regulation  is
presumed  unconstitutional,  but  it  is  acceptable  in  certain,  narrow
circumstances.  Content-neutral  restrictions  are  evaluated  through
a balancing  test, one  that looks  at the  extent  of the harm,  the  exis-
tence  of  alternative  outlets,  the  availability  of  less  restrictive
means  of  regulation,  and  so  forth.

These  general  propositions  lead  to  some  concrete  conclusions

for  hate  speech  and  pornography:

1.  Racial  hate  speech,  including  cross-burning,  often  qualifies
as  speech.  In  some  circumstances,  it  is  high-value  speech.  Much
racist  speech  belongs  at  the  free  speech  core  because  it  is  a  self-
conscious  contribution  to  social  deliberation  about  political  issues.
Government  may,  of course,  regulate  such  speech through  the  tres-
pass  laws  or  through  other  content-neutral  methods.  In  many  of

the  hard  cases,  the  question  is  whether  the  relevant  regulation  is
adequately  neutral.

2.  Courts  should  uphold  very  narrow,  content-based  restric-
tions  on  hate  speech  if  the  speech  in  question  is  not  reasonably
taken  to  be part of the  exchange  of ideas.  Colleges  and  universities
ought  to  have  mildly  broader  authority  over  hate  speech,  because
restrictions  on  some  such  speech  may  be  necessary  to  the  educa-
tional  mission.

3.  Certain  forms  of  pornography  count  as  speech,  but they  are
not plausibly  intended  or  received  as  a contribution  to  political  de-
liberation,  and  they  fall  within  the  low-value  category.  They  may
be regulated  on  the basis  of a lesser  showing  of harm than the First
Amendment  requires  for  regulation  of  political  speech.

4.  Sexual  and  racial  discrimination  in  the  workplace  can  be
analyzed  in  either  of  two  ways.  We  might  treat  discrimination,  if
purely  verbal,  as  low-value  speech,  regulable  because  of  the  dis-
tinctive  harms  it  causes.  Alternatively,  we  might  say  that  some
forms  of  discrimination  amount  to  the  commission  of  acts  that
may  be  prohibited  by  law.

There  is  a  broader  agenda  behind  these  claims.  Sometimes
constitutional  doctrine  seems to  have  lost sight  of the point of  cen-
tral  constitutional  commitments.  Sometimes  the  commitment  to
free  speech  seems  like  an  abstraction  insufficiently  closely  con-
nected  with  democratic  goals,  or  indeed  with  any  clearly  describa-
ble  set of  governing  aspirations.  A  good  first  step  is  to  insist that
the  First Amendment  has  a  point, or  a  set of  points,  that  this  in-
cludes  the  promotion  of a well-functioning  democratic  system,  and
that the  interpretation  of the Amendment  should have  this  goal  in
mind.  Similarly, the  commitment  to  equality  sometimes  seems  to
have lost  sight of its original  foundations  in the commitment  to the
rejection  of  the  system  of  caste.  Sometimes  it  seems  as  if equality,
as  a constitutional  concept, has  no clear  connection  to this  commit-
ment, or  to any identifiable  commitment  at all.  Of course there  are
sharp institutional  limits  on the  capacities  of courts  to promote  the
goals  of  the  Civil  War  Amendments,  as  the  framers  were  well
aware.'  Enforcement  of  those  goals  now  seems  to  have  fallen  to
other  branches-a  highly  salutary  development-and  when  Con-
gress  and  the President  have  attempted  to carry  forward  their  con-
stitutional  responsiblities,  courts  should  be  hospitable  rather  than
grudging.

This Essay is  organized  into five  sections. Section  I briefly sets
out an equality  principle that  bears  on free  speech problems.  Using
conventional  doctrinal categories,  Section  II offers  an  argument for
allowing  regulation  of  certain  forms  of  pornography  and  hate
speech. Section III  discusses  the view that regulation  of this kind is
impermissibly selective.  Section IV  attempts to  sort out some com-
plex  issues  involving  the  distinction  between  words  and  conduct.
Section  V  outlines  some  possible  directions  for  the  future;  it  pays
special  attention  to  the  possibility  of  preventing  harms  through
strategies  that  do  not  raise  First Amendment  problems.

I.  THE  ANTICASTE  PRINCIPLE-AND  FREE  SPEECH

A.  Caste

I  am  concerned  here  with  the  relationship  between  equality
and free  speech. To  discuss that relationship,  we must first  identify
the  appropriate  conception  of  equality.  At  the  origin,  the  central
target  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  was  not  irrational  distinc-
tions  based  on race,  but rather the  system  of racial  caste  in-Ameri-
can  society.3  For  those  who  ratified  the  post-Civil  War  Amend-
ments,  the problem  was  that the  law  had  contributed  to  a system
of  caste  based  on  race,  thought  to  be  a  morally  irrelevant
characteristic.

Those who  framed  and ratified  these Amendments  were  aware
that  the  system  of  racial  hierarchy  had  often  been  attributed  to
nature.  Thus  in  the  aftermath  of  the  American  Civil  War,  it  was
expressly  urged,  "God  himself has  set His  seal  of distinctive  differ-
ence between  the two  races,  and  no  human  legislation  can  overrule
the  Divine  decree. ' '4  In  the  same  period,  antidiscrimination  law
was  challenged  squarely  on  the ground  that it  put the  two  races  in
"unnatural relation  . .
. to  each  other."'  The  post-Civil  War
Amendments  thus  rejected  the  supposed naturalness  of racial  hier-
archy.  The  framers  thought  this  hierarchy  was  a  function  not  of
natural  difference  but  of  law,  most notably  the  law  of slavery  and

the  various  measures  that  grew  up  in  the  aftermath  of  abolition.6
The  animating  purpose  of  the  Civil  War  Amendments  was  an  at-
tack  on  racial  caste.

We  might  similarly  understand  the problem  of sex  discrimina-
tion  as  the  existence  of  a  caste-like  system,  based  on  gender  and
often  operating through law.  That system,  like the racial  caste  sys-
tem  and  others  as  well,  is  often  attributed  to  "nature"  and  "natu-
ral  differences."  Consider  here  Mill's  remarks:

But was  there  any  domination  which  did  not  appear  natural
to  those  who  possessed  it?  . . . So  true  is  it  that  unnatural
generally  means  only  uncustomary,  and  that  everything which
is  usual appears  natural. The  subjection  of women  to men  be-
ing  a  universal  custom,  any  departure  from  it  quite  naturally
appears  unnatural.7

A  principal  feature  of the caste  system  based  on  gender  consists  of
legal  and social  practices  that translate  women's  sexual  and  repro-
ductive  capacities  into  a  source  of  second-class  citizenship.  Con-
sider, for  example,  inequalities in  political  influence, the dispropor-
tionate  subjection  of  women  to  poverty  and  sexual  violation,  and
differences  in  educational  opportunity  and  health  care.8

In these  circumstances,  I suggest  that the appropriate  equality
principle in the areas  of both race  and sex  equality is  an opposition
to caste.  The  legal  objection  should  be  understood  as  an  effort  to
eliminate,  in  places  large  and  small,  caste-like  discrimination
rooted  in  race  and  gender.  The  controlling  principle  is  not  that
blacks  and  women  must  be treated  "the  same"  as  whites  and  men,
but that  blacks  and  women  must  not  be  second-class  citizens.

With  respect  to  vindication  of  the  anticaste  principle,  there
are  important  differences  between  the obligations  of the courts  and

Consider,  for  example,  Senator  Pratt's  remarks  during  debate  on  proposed  amend-
ments to the Civil  Rights Act of 1875: "You  object because  they have been  a servile race and
are  as  yet  unfit to  perform  the  duties  of  citizenship.  But who  made  them slaves  and  kept
them  in  ignorance?"  43d  Cong,  1st  Sess  (May  20,  1874),  in  2  Cong  Rec  4082.

Collected Works of John Stuart Mill 259,  269-70  (Toronto, 1984).  Compare  this description
of attitudes  in  prerevolutionary  America:

So distinctive  and  so separated  was  the  aristocracy  from  ordinary  folk  that many  still
thought  the  two  groups  represented  two  orders  of being .... 
Ordinary  people  were
thought to  be  different physically,  and because  of varying  diets  and living  conditions,
no  doubt  in  many  cases  they  were  different.  People  often  assumed  that  a handsome
child,  though  apparently  a  commoner,  had to  be  some gentleman's  bastard  offspring.

the  obligations  of legislatures.  It  should  not  be  forgotten  that  the
nation  originally  anticipated  legislative  enforcement  of the  obliga-
tions  of the  Civil  War  Amendments.9  Indeed,  the  judicial  enforce-
ment  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  stands  as  one  of  the  most
profound  ironies  in  constitutional  history.  In  the  aftermath  of  the
Dred Scott decision,  the ratifiers  anticipated legislative  rather  than
judicial  implementation  of  the  Civil  War  Amendments,  and  Sec-
tion  5  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  was  thought  especially
important.10

History  aside,  a  high  degree  of judicial  caution  is justified  on
many  grounds.  Courts  lack  the  relevant  factfinding  abilities  and
policymaking  competence.  Because  their  judgments  are  not  self-
implementing,  judges  often  fail  when  they  attempt  to  produce
large-scale  social  reform.1"  There  are  also  serious  problems  of dem-
ocratic  legitimacy  when  courts  seek  to  introduce  large  changes  on
their  own.  For these  reasons,  courts  ought to  play a cautious  role in
the  elimination  of  caste.  But the  need  for  judicial  caution  should
not  obscure  the  substantive  point:  The  anticaste  principle  lies  at
the  heart  of  the  constitutional  prohibition,  and  that  principle  im-
poses  substantial  duties  on  Congress  and  the  President.

The  concept  of  caste  by  no  means  defines  itself. I will have  to
offer  a  brief  and  inadequate  account  here. 12  In  so  doing  I  do  not
suggest  that the  caste-like  features  of  all  societies  containing  race
and  sex inequality  are the same.  Certainly, the American  system  of
race  and  sex  discrimination  is  far  less  oppressive  than  most  sys-
tems  of racial  and  gender  caste.  But I  do  claim  that the  caste-like
features  are  what  justify  social  and  legal  concern.

The  motivating  idea behind  an  anticaste  principle  is, broadly
speaking,  Rawlsian  in  character. 3  It  holds  that  without  very  good
reasons,  social  and legal  structures  ought  not  to turn  morally-irrel-
evant  differences  into  social  disadvantages,  and  certainly not  if the
disadvantage  is  systemic.  A difference  is morally irrelevant  if it  has
no  relationship  to  individual  entitlement  or  desert.  Race  and  sex
are  certainly  morally  irrelevant  characteristics  in  this  sense;  the
bare fact of skin color  or  gender  does not entitle  one to  social  supe-
riority. Of  course,  individual  needs  may  depend  in  part  on  race  or

A  systemic  disadvantage  is  one  that  operates  along  standard
and predictable  lines in multiple  important  spheres  of life,  and ap-
plies  in  realms  that  relate  to  basic  participation  as  a  citizen  in  a
democracy.  These  realms  include  education,  health  care,  freedom
from  private  and  public  violence,  wealth,  political  representation,
and  political  influence. 15  The  anticaste  principle  means  that  one
group  ought not to  be  systematically  beneath  another  with  respect
to  basic  human  capabilities  and  functionings.1'  A  particular  con-
cern is  that self-respect  and its social  bases  ought not to  be distrib-
uted  along  the  lines  of race  and gender. 17  The  social  practices  in  a
system of  caste  produce  a range  of  obstacles  to the  development  of
self-respect,  largely  because  of  the  presence  of  the  morally  irrele-
vant characteristic  that  gives  rise  to  caste-like  status.

In  the areas  of race  and sex discrimination,  the problem  is pre-
cisely  this  sort of systemic  disadvantage.  A  social  or  biological  dif-
ference  systematically  subordinates  the  relevant  group-not  be-
cause  of  "nature,"  but  because  of  social  and  legal  practices.  The
resulting  inequality  occurs  in  multiple  spheres  and  along  multiple
indices  of  social  welfare:  poverty,  education,  health,  political
power,  employment,  susceptibility  to  violence  and  crime,  and  so
forth. 8  That  is  the  caste  system  to  which  the  legal  system  should
respond.  This  point  does  not  deny  the  fact  of biological  difference
or  even  biological  disadvantage.  I do  not  claim that there would  be
equality  in the state  of nature, a  question  that is  irrelevant  for  our
purposes. 9  The  point  is  that  social  and  legal  practices  make  bio-
logical  differences  count,  or  matter,  and  this  point  is  not  falsified
by  showing  what  would  happen  in  "nature."  What  is  at  issue  is
whether  the  social  and  legal  practices  are  justified.

B.  Speech

Very  provisionally,  I propose that the  free  speech principle  at-
tempts  to  protect  all  symbols,  whether  or  not  words,  that  contrib-
ute  to the exchange  of ideas.  (I offer many  refinements  and qualifi-
cations  below.)  Thus  understood,  the  free  speech  principle  can
march  hand-in-hand  with  the  anticaste  principle,  and there is  usu-
ally  no  tension  between  them.  When  tension  does  arise,  courts
ought to  minimize  infringements  on  either  principle.  But  it is  cer-
tainly  imaginable  that  unrestricted  speech  can  contribute  to  gen-
der  and  racial  caste.  For  example,  a  principal  feature  of  a  caste
system  consists  of  disproportionate  subjection  to  public  and  pri-
vate  violence.  Acts  that  are  symbolic  and  expressive  in  charac-
ter-like  some  lynchings  and  some  rapes-are  important  features
of a constitutionally  unacceptable  caste  system.  But the problem is
not  limited  to  expressive  acts.  It is  plausible  that in  their  produc-
tion  and  use,  some  forms  of pornography  are  associated  with  vio-
lence  against  women. 20  It  is  also  plausible  that  both  pornography
and racial  hate  speech  have  corrosive  consequences  on  the  self-re-
spect  of  women  and  blacks.  In  these  circumstances,  unrestricted
speech  may  contribute  to the  maintenance  of  a system  with  caste-
like  features.

The  constitutional  task  then  is  to  interpret  the  free  speech
and anticaste  principles  in such  a way as  to accommodate  both  as-
pirations. We  might  perform  this  task  in two  ways.  First, the  defi-
nition  of protected  speech  could  seek  to  exclude  the  most  damag-
ing  forms  of  expression,  on  the  theory  that  those  forms  do  not
belong  in  the  "top  tier"  of  constitutional  protection  and  can  be
regulated  because  they cause  sufficient  harms.  Second,  the  govern-
ment  might  be  permitted  to justify  certain  narrow  restrictions  on
speech  by  reference  to  the  Civil  War  Amendments,  by  claiming
that the interest  in  equality  is  sufficiently  neutral  and  weighty  to
support  those  restrictions.21  I  will  invoke  both  of  these  strategies
below.

II. 

CONVENTIONAL  DOCTRINE

In  this  Section,  I  set  the  debate  over  pornography  and  hate
speech  in the  context  of general  First Amendment  doctrine.2 2  Cur-
rent law  distinguishes  between  low-value  and  high-value  speech;  it
treats  bribery,  perjury,  unlicensed  medical  and  legal  advice,  mis-
leading  commercial  speech,  and much  else as  bannable  on the basis
of  a  lesser  showing  of harm.2 3  An  approach  of this  sort  is  not  only
embedded  in  current  law;  it  is  also  practically  unavoidable.  There
is  no  way  to  run  a  system  of  free  expression  without  making  dis-
tinctions  between  different  forms  of speech  in  terms  of their  cen-
trality  to  free  speech  ideals.  I  suggest  that  much  pornography
stands far  afield  of those  ideals  and  is regulable  because  of the tan-
gible  harms that it  causes. Hate speech  often  does  stand  at the  free
speech  core, but it  can be regulated  (a) in a content-neutral  way,  as
through  the trespass  laws,  and (b)  with narrow  controls  on epithets
amounting  to "fighting  words."  I also suggest that colleges  and uni-
versities  should  have  mildly  greater  authority  over  this  form  of
speech.

A.  Pornography

A now-familiar  position,  originally  developed  by Andrea  Dwor-
kin  and  Catharine  MacKinnon,  has  emerged  on  the  question  of le-
gal  control  of pornography.2 4 The  precise  nature of  this position  is
of course  a matter  of controversy.  As  I shall  present  the  argument
here,  the basic  claim  is that sexually  explicit speech  should be  reg-
ulated  not because  it  is  sexually  explicit  (the problem  of  "obscen-
ity")  but because  and  when  it  merges  sex with  violence  (the prob-
lem  of  "pornography").  The  problem  of  pornography  does  not
stem from  offense, from  public access to sexually explicit materials,
from  an unregulated  erotic life,  or  from violation  of traditional val-
ues  or  community  standards.  Instead,  the problem  consists  of tan-
gible  real-world  harms, caused  by the  portrayal  of women  and  chil-
dren  as objects  for the control  and use  of others, most prominently

through  sexual  violence.  The  objection  to  pornography  is  thus
closely  associated  with  the  anticaste  principle,  as  that  principle
manifests  itself in  many  efforts  to  prevent  sex-related  violence. 25

1.  Pornography,  coercion,  and  violence.

My  argument  here  thus  deals  with  pornography  that  involves
violence  or  coercion 26  and  with the  claim  that pornography  should
be  regulated  because  and  when  it  harms  women.  Not  all  of  those
who  focus  on  this problem  understand  it  in this way.  Some  people
treat pornography  as  a problem  of sex  discrimination  not  only  be-
cause  of its association  with coercion  and  violence,  but also  because
it  is  connected  with  subordination  and  dehumanization  more  gen-
erally.27  It  is  certainly  reasonable  to  think that  non-violent  mate-
rial might  portray  women  in  a subordinate  way, or  treat women  as
objects  for  the  use and  control  of others,  and that  here  too there is
reason  for  legal  concern.  If  we  moved  beyond  coercion  and  vio-
lence, we  might ask more  broadly  about the  role  of pornography  in
creating inequality  through the sexual subordination  or  objectifica-
tion  of women. I restrict the  discussion here,  however,  to  pornogra-
phy  that  is  associated  with  violence  or  coercion  either  in  its  pro-
duction  or  in  its  use.  I  do  so  for  two  reasons.  First,  subjection  to
violence  and  coercion  is an  important  ingredient  in sexual inequal-
ity. Second,  the  broader  understanding  of  the  harms  that  pornog-
raphy  produces  raises  trickier  First  Amendment  difficulties;  it  is
helpful  to  begin  with  a relatively  narrow  understanding.

2.  Civil  vs.  criminal  remedies.

The  approach  I am  discussing  involves  not a criminal  ban, but
a  civil remedy  for  those  who  can  prove  actual  harm  as  a  result  of
pornography. 8  This  remedy  would  work most  simply  on  behalf  of
women  abused  in the  production  of pornography.  It  would also  of-
fer  a tort-like  remedy  for  women  who  can  prove,  under  normal  le-

26 1  use  the  words  "violence"  and  "coercion"  in  their  most  conventional  sense.  It  is

possible that  someone  could  be  coerced  to  participate  in  nonviolent  pornography,  and this
could be  tortious  under  the  approach  I am  suggesting.

217 See,  for  example,  Rae  Langton,  Whose  Right?:  Ronald  Dworkin,  Women,  and
Pornographers, 19  Phil & Pub Aff  311,  335-36  (1990)  (interpreting  MacKinnon's argument).
MacKinnon's  own  position  on  this  is  complex.  Subordination  is  her  principal  target,  not
simply  violence;  but  I  think  that  violence  or  coercion  in  some  form  underlies  much  of the
argument and almost  all  of her  examples.  See MacKinnon,  Feminism Unmodified at 32-45,
166-95.

gal  standards,  that they have  been  harmed  by the use  of  pornogra-
phy  to  stimulate  sex  crimes. 29  In  both  cases,  the  usual  remedy
would  be  an  award  of monetary  damages  for  actual  harm.  In  some
circumstances,  a  victim  might  also  seek  an  injunction  to  prevent
continued  distribution  or  use  of  harmful  material.  For  example,  a
woman forced  to participate  in  a pornographic  movie might  be per-
mitted  to  enjoin  further  sale  of the  movie.

Under  this  approach,  the  category  of  regulable  speech  might
be  relatively  broad  or  extremely  narrow.  We  might,  for  example,
adopt  the  basic  approach  but  decide  to  ensure  protection  for  all
material  with  serious  social  value.  We  might also  refuse to  regulate
speech  unless  it  has little  real  cognitive  content.  Or  we  might seek
to  regulate  a subcategory  of obscenity  defined  in terms  of harms  to
women.  In  any  case,  the  category  of regulable  speech  could  prove
to  be  much  smaller  than  the  category  now  subject  to  regulation
under  the  antiobscenity  approach.  This  important  point  is  often
missed.  The  real  difference  between  this  approach  and  the  current
focus  on  obscenity 0  lies  not in  greater  breadth  of  coverage  but in
its  emphasis  on  discrimination  and  harm to  women rather  than of-
fense  or  contemporary  community  standards.3 1

How  is  the  First  Amendment  issue  affected  if women  injured
by pornography  are  given  a civil  action  and  if criminal  prosecutors
have  no  enforcement  authority?  In  some  ways,  the  civil  action
helps  alleviate  the  First  Amendment  concerns.  There  is  a  special
problem  whenever  the  government  proceeds  against  speech  that  it
deems  harmful,  and  a  private  suit  does  not  pose  this  problem.  In
particular,  there  might  seem  to  be  no  free  speech  problem  if  a
woman  injured  in the production  of pornography  brings  suit to  re-
cover  damages  for  the harms  done  to her.32  On the  other hand,  the

30  See  Miller v  California, 413  US  15  (1973).  The Miller standard  defines  obscenity  as
material  that (a) under contemporary  community standards  appeals  to the prurient interest;
(b)  "depicts  or describes,  in a patently  offensive  way, sexual  conduct specifically  defined  by
the applicable  state  law";  and  (c) taken as  a whole  "lacks  serious literary,  artistic, political,

11  To be  sure, it is  sometimes  the case  that the state  cannot punish speech  that is pro-
duced  through  illegality;  it may punish the  illegality but not the  publication. See New  York
Times v  United States, 403 US  713,  730-40  (1971)  (White  concurring)  ("Pentagon  Papers"
case).  This  idea  makes most  sense  when  (a) the  speech  is high-value;  (b) the  punishment of
the  illegality  should  provide  sufficient  deterrence,  that  is,  there  are  no  special  reasons  to
think that  a ban  on  publication  is  a necessary  adjunct  to  the  criminal  law;  or  (c)  both.

state  is  unquestionably  involved  when  it  awards  damages  for
harms  done  by speech,  and we  know  from New  York  Times  v  Sul-
livan3  that the  First Amendment  imposes  barriers  to  government
efforts  to force  speakers  to pay  for  the  real  costs  that  their  speech
produces.  The  parallel  to  New  York  Times is very  close  if the  gov-
ernment  says  that  anyone  who  produces  art  and  literature  must
pay  for injuries that result from  his work. The  question  is not lim-
ited  to  material  containing  sexual  violence.  Dostoevsky's  Crime
and Punishment is  said to  have  been  followed  by a  series  of  copy-
cat  murders  in  Russia.

Serious  constitutional  problems  would  arise  if  government
were  to  say that all  speakers  must pay  the  victims to  restore losses
from any crimes  proximately resulting from their speech.  First, any
judge  or  jury  decision  about  causation  might  well  be  unreliable,
suspect,  or  affected  by bias  of  various  sorts.  Second,  the  actor, not
the  speaker,  should  normally  bear  the  burden  for  harm,  at least
when  the normal  First Amendment  standards  have not been met.34
(This concern  does  not arise when  the  actor is the speaker.)  And  at
least  if we  are  talking  about  speech  that is  genuinely  in  the  First
Amendment  core,  New  York  Times  seems  to  say that government
may  not  require  speakers  to  "internalize"  the  costs  of  what  they
say.35  The  Court's  rationale  is  that cost-internalization  will impose
an  excessive  chilling  effect  on  valuable  speech.3 6  It  is  possible  to
question  this view,3 7 but it seems to  be the  law, and so  long as it is,
a  civil  action  for  harms  that result  from  speech  is  not  fundamen-
tally different  from  criminal  prosecution.  Aside  from  the  case  of  a
damage  remedy  for  harms  to  participants  in  pornography,  as  to
which  the  free  speech  concerns  seem  minimal, 38  I  will  therefore
proceed  on  the  assumption  that as  far  as  the  First Amendment  is
concerned,  the  civil  and criminal  remedies  stand on  the  same basic
ground.  The  assumption  may  not  be  accurate  insofar  as  we  are
dealing  with  speech far  afield  from the free  speech  core.  But I will
put this  point  to  one  side.

3.  Antipornography  vs.  antiobscenity.

It  is  often  suggested  that  the  antipornography  position  raises
especially  serious  free  speech  questions  and  that  the antiobscenity
and  "no  regulation"  positions  are  far  preferable. 9  In  fact, however,
there  is  a  quite  straightforward  argument  for  regulating  at  least
some  narrowly  defined  class  of  pornographic  materials.  The  first
point, made by traditional  obscenity  law  as well,  is that much por-
nographic  material  lies  far  from  the  center  of  First  Amendment
concern.4 °  Under  current  doctrine,  and  under  any  sensible  system
of  free  expression,  speech  that  lies  at  the  periphery  of  constitu-
tional  concern  may  be regulated  on  a lesser  showing  of  harm  than
speech  that  lies  at the  core.

To  be  sure, it  is  not simple  to define  the core  and  the  periph-
ery.  Debates  over  that  issue  are  a staple  of First  Amendment  con-
troversy.4 1 Familiar  organizing  theories  look  to  whether  the speech
at  issue  is  connected  with  the  exchange  of  ideas,4  or  is  intended
and  received  as  a  contribution  to  social  deliberation  about  some
issue.4"  This latter position,  with  roots in James  Madison,  seems to
me  most plausible,4  but under  nearly  any  standard,  at least  some
pornographic  materials  will  be  easily  classified  in  the  free  speech
periphery.  Such  materials  fall  in  the  same  category  as  misleading
commercial  speech,  libel  of  private  persons,  conspiracies,  unli-
censed  medical  or  legal  advice,  bribes,  perjury,  threats,  and  so
forth.  These  forms  of  speech  do  not appeal  to  deliberative  capaci-
ties  about public  matters,  or  about matters  at all-even  if this  cat-
egory  is  construed  quite  broadly,  as  it  should  be,  and  even  if we
insist, as  we  should,  that  emotive  and  cognitive  capacities  are  fre-
quently  intertwined  in  deliberative  processes  and  that  any  sharp
split between  "emotion"  and  "cognition"  would be  untrue to politi-
cal  discussion.  Many  forms  of  pornography  are  not  an  appeal  to

the  exchange  of  ideas,  political  or  otherwise;  they  operate  as  mas-
turbatory  aids  and  do  not  qualify  for  top-tier  First  Amendment
protection  under  the prevailing  theories. 45

An  important  qualification  is  necessary  here.  Those  who  write
or  read  sexually  explicit  material  can  often  claim  important  ex-
pressive  and  deliberative  interests. 46  Sexually  explicit  works can  be
highly  relevant  to  the  development  of  individual  capacities.  For
many, they  are  important  vehicles  for  self-discovery  and  self-defi-
nition.41  In  light  of the complexity  of sexuality,  the  same  might  be
said  of  some  of  the  most  graphic  forms  of  sexually  explicit  mate-
rial,  even  if they  feature  violence.  Perhaps  such  speech  is  not  in-
tended  and  received  as  a  contribution  to  democratic  debate.  But
the  development  of individual  capacities  is  instrumental  to  demo-
cratic  characteristics, 4s  and  in  any  case  it  might  be urged  that the
presence  of  expressive  and  deliberative  interests  qualifies  material
for  treatment  as  within  the  free  speech  core.

In  this  space  I cannot  fully  evaluate  this view.  No  one  has set
out  an  approach  to  free  speech  value  based  on  expressive  and  de-
liberative  value.  Such  an  approach  would,  however,  have  a  ques-
tionable  historical  pedigree.  Wherever  it  may  stand  in philosophy,
it  appears  to be something  of a newcomer  to  our constitutional  tra-
dition.  Moreover,  it  does  not  connect  well  with  an  understanding
of  when  government's  motives  are  least  likely  to  be  trustworthy.4 9
In  any  case,  the approach  appears  to  fit  poorly  with  both  existing
law  and  ordinary  convictions  about  particular  cases.  For  example,
child  pornography  and  scientific  speech  might well be able  to  claim
expressive  and  deliberative  interests,  and  it  seems  hard  to  claim

'5 To  be  sure,  pornography  is political  in  the sense  that it  has  political  consequences.
But this does  not mean that it  is political  in the First Amendment  sense of that word. Much
speech  that does  not  belong in  the top tier-misleading  commercial  speech, attempted  brib-
ery  of public officials-has  political  consequences.  If speech  qualifies  for  the  top  tier when-
ever  it  has  such  consequences,  almost  all  speech  would  so  qualify,  and  First  Amendment
doctrine would be made  senseless.  Instead, the test is  whether  it  is intended  and received  as
a  contribution  to democratic  deliberation-and  much  pornography  fails  that test. It  is true
that the recent attack on pornography  has drawn  attention to its political  character,  but this
fact  does  not undermine  the  First Amendment  argument,  since  the  First Amendment  con-
ception  of "the  political"  is  properly  and importantly  different  from  the  conception  of "the
political"  in  popular  discussion.

that they belong in the  free speech  core.  If they  did, they  could  not
be  regulable  in  light  of the stringent  standards  applied  to  material
within  the  core.  To  be  sure,  such  materials  are  associated  with
harm;  but for  material  in  the  core,  the  proper  approach  would  be
to  attack  the  offending  conduct  directly  rather  than  the  speech,
and  to  allow the  speech  so  long  as the  Brandenburg v  Ohio50  stan-
dard  has  not been  met. These  considerations  suggest that  material
ought  not  to  belong  in  the  free  speech  core,  or  in  any  top  tier  of
protection,  by  virtue  of  its  connection  with  deliberative  and  ex-
pressive  interests,  even  if it  is  assumed  that  pornography  is  well-
connected  with those  interests.

I  do  not  claim  that  expressive  and  deliberative  interests  are
irrelevant.  When they  are  at stake,  the material  at issue  is  entitled
to  at  least  a  degree  of  constitutional  protection.  It  cannot  be
banned  or  controlled  without  a  showing  of  genuine  harm-much
like  commercial  speech, private  libel, and  scientific  speech. But be-
cause  at least  some  sexually  explicit material  is far  from the  center
of  constitutional  concern,  it  can  be  regulated  on  the  basis  of  a
lesser  showing  of  harm.

Pornographic  material  causes  sufficient  harms  to  justify regu-
lation  under  the  more  lenient  standards  applied  to  speech  that
does  not  fit  within  the free  speech  core.  Of  course  it  is  possible  to
question  the  extent  of  the  relevant  harms;  the  empirical  debates
are  complex,  and  I will  only  summarize  some  of the  evidence  here.
But  the  harms  do  create  a  far  stronger  case  for  regulation  than
underlies  the  antiobscenity  position,  which  relies  on  less  tangible
aesthetic  goals and  on the more vague  idea of adherence  to  conven-
tional  moral standards.  Notably, the  relevant  harms  consist of  acts
committed  against  women  by  men.  The  category  of  regulable
speech  would  therefore  less  plausibly  include  homosexual  pornog-
raphy, for  which  the same  showing  of harm  cannot  be  made  (so far
as  I  am  aware).

The  harms  fall  in three  categories. 1  First, the  existence  of the
pornography  market  produces  a  number  of  harms  to  models  and
actresses. 5 2 Many  women, usually very young,  are  coerced  into por-
nography.  Others  are  abused  and  mistreated,  often  in  grotesque
ways,  once  they  enter  the pornography  "market."  To  be sure,  most

women  who  participate  are  not  so  abused.  It  is  therefore  tempting
to respond  that government  should  adopt a less restrictive  alterna-
tive.  Rather  than  regulating  the  speech,  government  should  ban
the  coercion  or  mistreatment,  as  indeed  current  state  law  does.
Usually  this  strategy  is indeed  better  and  even  constitutionally  re-
quired. 3  But in this  peculiar  setting,  such  an  alternative  would  be
a  recipe  for  disaster,  because  it  would  simply  allow  existing  prac-
tices  to  continue.  The  enforcement  problems  are  so  difficult  that
restrictions  on  the material  are  necessary  to supplement the  crimi-
nal  ban. 4

Second,  it  is  reasonable  to  think that there  is  a causal  connec-
tion  between  pornography  and  violence  against  women. 5  The  ex-
tent  of the  effect  and  the precise  relationship  between  exposure  to
pornographic  and  sexual  violence  are  sharply  disputed.  No  one
suggests  that  sexual violence  would  disappear  if pornography  were
eliminated,  or  that most  consumers  of violent  pornography  act  out
what  they  see  or  read.  But  a  review  of  the  literature  suggests  a
reasonable  legislature  could  conclude  that  pornography  does  in-
crease  the  incidence  of  sexual  violence  against  women.  The  evi-
dence  includes  laboratory  experiments,  longitudinal  studies  of  the
effects  of increased  availability  of pornography,  and victim  and  po-

53  It  is  by  no  means  clear  that  government  can  ban  speech  merely  because  there  is
illegality in  its production  or acquisition.  See New  York  Times v  United States, 403  US  713
(1971)  (allowing  publication  of material  that was  acquired  unlawfully).  Especially  when  the
material  belongs  in  the  free  speech  top  tier, the  proper  remedy  is  to prevent  the  illegality
rather  than to  prevent the publication,  at least  if the Brandenburg standard  cannot be met.
In  most cases,  government should  be required to proceed  against the offending  conduct.  But
in the context of pornography, these  strictures should  not apply. By hypothesis,  the material
is not in  the  top  tier, and  for reasons  stated in  the  text, it  seems  inadequate  to require  the
government to  proceed  against the  conduct.

The  Court recognized  this point  in  the context  of child  pornography  in  New  York  v

lice  testimony.5 7  All  three  sources  indicate  a  plausible  connection
between  exposure to  sexually  violent  material  and  sexually  violent
acts.

Evidence  of 

this  kind  presents 

severe  methodological
problems.  Laboratory  experiments  may  inadequately  connect  to
the  real  world,  longitudinal  studies  cannot  easily  control  for  other
variables,  and  victim  and  police  testimony  is  anecdotal.  Even  if
there  were  a  close  causal  connection  between  pornography  and
real-world  violence,  social  science  would  have  a hard  time  proving
it.  But  the  current  evidence  is  sufficiently  suggestive  to  indicate
that  the  real  question  is  not  the  existence  of  a  causal  connection
but its degree.  In light of current  information,  it  would  be reasona-
ble  for  a legislature  to  think  that  there  would  be  genuine  benefits
from  regulation  of violent  pornography.

These  first  two  arguments-harm  to participants  and  a causal
connection  with violent acts-suggest  that antipornography  legisla-
tion  should  be  addressed  only to movies  and  pictures,  and  not  the
written word.  Of course  it  is  only in movies  and  pictures  that abuse
of  participants  will  occur.  (One  might  similarly  support  a  law
against  child pornography  in movies  and  print while  allowing  writ-
ten  essays  that amount  to child  pornography.)  Moreover,  the  evi-
dence  on  pornography  as  a  stimulus  to  violence  deals  mostly with
movies  and  pictures,  and the immediacy  and vividness  of these me-
dia  suggest  a possible  distinction  from  written  texts.  I  do  not  dis-
cuss  the  exact  breadth  of an antipornography  statute here.  But the
possibility  of  exempting  written  texts,  no  matter  what  they  con-
tain,  suggests the weakness  of the objection  from neutrality:  a  stat-
ute  that exempts  written  texts  is  very  plausibly  treated  as  harm-
based  rather  than  viewpoint-based.58

The  third  and  most  general  point  is  that  pornography  pro-
motes  degrading  and  dehumanizing  behavior  toward  women.  Sig-
nificantly,  this  behavior  includes  a  variety  of  forms  of  illegal  con-
duct, prominent  among  them sexual  harassment.  The pornography
industry  operates  as  a  conditioning  factor  for  some  men  and
women,  a  factor  that  has  consequences  for  equality  between  men
and  women. These  conditioning  effects  are  associated with  harmful
consequences  for  self-respect.  Of  course,  pornography  is  more
symptom  than  cause;  but it  is  cause  as  well.  One  need  not  believe

that  the  elimination  of  pornography  would  bring  about  sexual
equality,  eliminate  sexual  violence,  or  change  social  attitudes  in
any  fundamental  way  in  order  to  agree  that  a  regulatory  effort
could  reduce  violence  and  diminish  views  that  contribute  to  ex-
isting  inequalities.

Invoking the  injury  to self-respect,  a common  argument  holds
that  this  dehumanizing  behavior  has  the  effect  of  "silencing"
women:  making  them believe  that their  opinions  are  of less  impor-
tance,  will  be  ignored,  will  meet  social  sanctions,  or  worse. 59  It  is
surely  reasonable  to  think  that  such  silencing  occurs.  But  hard
questions  are  raised  by the  claim  that the  argument  from  "silenc-
ing"  properly  plays  a  significant  role  in  the  First  Amendment  in-
quiry. This  form of  silencing  is produced  by social  attitudes  result-
ing  from  speech  itself, and  perhaps  one  cannot  find  that  to  be  a
reason  for regulation  without making  excessive  inroads  on a system
of free  expression.  Many  forms  of speech  do  indeed  have  silencing
effects,  and  this  is not a  sufficient  reason to  regulate  them.6 0  There
are  two  problems  here.  First, it  is  uncertain  whether  the  form  of
silencing  that  results  from  speech  itself should  be,  in  principle,  a
basis  for  regulating  speech.  Certainly  in  general  it  seems  right  to
say  that  people  intimidated  by the  speech  of  others  should  learn
not  to be  intimidated,  rather than  receive  a right to  silence  intimi-
dating  speech. 1  Second,  even  if we  resolve  the  question  of princi-
ple  in  favor  of  the  "silencing"  argument,  government  institutions
are  peculiarly  unlikely  to  be  able  to  make  reliable  judgments  on
this  issue.  It  is  plausible  to  think that would-be  speakers  are  often
silenced  by  especially  vigorous  challenges,  and  government  regula-
tion  of those challenges,  based  on  "silencing,"  might  well be  rooted
in objectionable  motivations  and  untrustworthy  conclusions.  Much
remains to  be  done  on  this difficult  subject. But in the  area  of por-
nography  regulation,  it  seems  best  to avoid  the  most  controversial
and  adventurous  claims,  and  so  I will  not rely  on  the silencing  ar-
gument  here.

Taken as  a whole,  these considerations  suggest  a quite conven-
tional  argument  for  regulation  of  pornography,  one  that  fits  well
with  the  rest  of  free  speech  law. For  example,  misleading  commer-
cial  speech  is  regulable  because  it  is  not  entitled  to  the  highest

10  See  Dworkin,  Two  Concepts of Liberty at  107-09  (cited in  note  39).
61 Under  some  narrow  circumstances,  this conclusion  may  not hold.  The university  set-

ting is  a possible  example in  that certain sorts  of abusive faculty  speech may  silence  student
speech.

form  of  protection  and  because  the  harms  produced  by  such
speech  are  sufficient  to  allow  for  regulation.  The  same  is  true  of
libel  of  private  persons,  criminal  solicitation,  unlicensed  legal  or
medical  advice,  and  conspiracy.  Certain  forms  of  pornography
should  be  approached  similarly.  Indeed,  the  argument  for  regula-
tion-in  view  of  the  nature  of  the  material  and  the  evidence  of
harm-seems  more  powerful  than  the  corresponding  argument  for
many  forms  of  speech  now  subject  to  government  control.  Thus
far,  then,  the  hard  issues  have  to  do  with  the  appropriate  breadth
and  clarity  of  any  prohibition,  not with  the  basic  approach.

B.  Hate  Speech

Hate  speech  raises  quite  different  issues  from  pornography.
Hate  speech  is  often  part  and  parcel  of  public  debate  on  certain
questions;  pornography  is  not. Many  forms  of pornography  are  far
from  the  center  of  constitutional  concern;  nothing  of this  sort  can
be  said  for  the  many  kinds  of  hate  speech  that  are  designed  and
received  as judgments  about certain  social  questions.  If restrictions
on  hate  speech  cover  not  merely  epithets  but  also  speech  that  is
part  of  social  deliberation,  they  appear  overbroad  and  unconstitu-
tional  for  that very  reason.6 2  Speech  that  is  intended  and  received
as a contribution  to  social  deliberation  is constitutionally  protected
even  if it  amounts  to  hate  speech-even  if  it  is  racist  and  sexist.
In  a  famous  case,  Justice  Frankfurter,  speaking  for  a  5-4  ma-
jority,  seemed  to  reject  this  view.  Beauharnais v  Illinois3  upheld
an  Illinois  law  making  it  unlawful  to  publish  or  exhibit  any  publi-
cation  that  "portrays  depravity,  criminality,  unchastity,  or  lack  of
virtue  of a class  of citizens, which  [publication]  exposes  the  citizens
of  any race,  color,  creed  or  religion  to  contempt,  derision,  or  oblo-
quy  or  which  is  productive  of breach  of the  peace  or  riots. 6 4  The
law was  applied to ban  circulation  of a petition  urging  "the  need  to
prevent  the  white  race  from  becoming  mongrelized  by the  negro,"
and  complaining  of the  "aggressions,  rapes,  robberies,  knives,  guns
and  marijuana  of  the  negro. 6 5

In  upholding  the  law,  Justice  Frankfurter  referred  to  the  his-
torical exclusion  of libel from free  speech protection, to  the risks  to
social  cohesion  created  by  racial  hate  speech,  and to  the need  for
judicial  deference  to  legislative  judgments  on  these  complex  mat-
ters.66  Many  countries  in  Europe  accept  the  same  analysis  and  do
not  afford  protection  to  racial  and ethnic  hate  speech. 7  But most
people  think  that after  New  York  Times  v  Sullivan, Beauharnais
is  no  longer  the  law. 8  In  New  York  Times,  the  Court  indicated
that the law of libel must  be evaluated  in accordance  with  the con-
stitutional  commitment  to  robust  debate  on  public  issues. 9  The
conventional  view-which  the  Supreme  Court  has  not  directly  ad-
dressed-is  that racial  hate  speech  contains  highly  political  ideas,
and that it may not be  suppressed  merely because  it is offensive  or
otherwise  harmful.

There  are  real  complexities  here.  In its strongest  form, the  de-
fense of Beauharnais would point not only to Justice  Frankfurter's
argument,  but also  to the  contribution  of hate speech  to the main-
tenance  of  a  caste  system  based  on  race.  A  principal  point  here
would be the effect  of such speech  on  the self-respect  of its victims
and its  relationship  to fears  of racially-motivated  violence.70  I  can-
not fully  discuss  this  issue  here,  but I think that the conventional
view  on  the  matter  is  probably  correct.7 1 No  one  should  deny  that
distinctive  subjective  and  objective  harms  are  produced  by  racial
hate  speech,  especially  when  it is  directed  against  members  of mi-
nority  groups. It is  only  obtuseness-a failure  of perception  or  em-
pathetic  identification-that  would  enable  someone  to  say that the
word  "fascist"  or  "pig"  produces  the  same  feelings  as  the  word
"nigger." In view  of our history, invective  directed  against  minority
groups,  and racist  speech  in  general,  creates  fears  of  violence  and
subordination  that  are  not  plausibly  described  as  mere  offense.  It
might be  added that some forms  of hate  speech amount  to a denial
of  the  premise  of  political  equality  that  is  central  to  a  well-func-

tioning  democracy.  In  this light, there  is nothing  obvious  about the
view  that  the  law  should  be  banned  from  guarding  against  speech
that  causes  racial  hatred.  As  noted  above,  most  European  coun-
tries,  including  flourishing  democracies  committed  to  free  speech,
make  exceptions  for  such  expression.  In  many  countries,  including
our  own,  it  is possible  to think  that racial  and  ethnic hate speech is
really  sui generis, and  that  it  is  properly  treated  differently  from
other  forms  of  political  speech.

On  the other hand,  a good  deal  of public  debate involves  racial
or  religious  bigotry  or  even  hatred,  implicit  or  explicit.  If we  were
to excise  all  such  speech  from  political  debate,  we  would  severely
curtail  our  discussion  of such  important matters  as  civil rights,  for-
eign  policy, crime,  conscription,  abortion,  and social  welfare  policy.
Even  if a form  of  hate speech  is  involved,  it  might  well be  thought
a  legitimate  part  of  the  deliberative  process-it  bears  directly  on
politics. Foreclosure  of such  speech  would probably  accomplish  lit-
tle  good,  and  by  stopping  people  from  hearing  certain  ideas,  it
could bring  about a great  deal  of harm. These  are the  most conven-
tional  Millian  arguments  for  the protection  of speech. 72

These  general  propositions  do  not  resolve  all  of the  questions
raised  by restrictions  on  hate  speech, but they do  suggest  that dis-
tinctions  must  be  drawn  between  different  forms  of  speech  that
fall  within  the  category.  It  seems  to  follow  that  many  imaginable
restrictions  on hate  speech  cut too  broadly.  Consider, for  example,
the  University  of Michigan's  judicially  invalidated  ban  on  "[a]ny
behavior,  verbal  or  physical, that stigmatizes  or  victimizes  an  indi-
vidual  on  the basis  of race,  ethnicity,  religion,  sex,  sexual  orienta-
tion,  creed,  national  origin,  ancestry,  age,  marital  status, handicap,
or  Vietnam-era  veteran  status,  and  that  .
. [c]reates  an  intimi-
dating, hostile,  or  demeaning  environment  for  educational  pursuits
,,73This  sort of broad  ban forbids  a  wide range  of statements
.... 
that  are  part  of the  exchange  of  ideas.  It  also  fails  to  give  people
sufficient  notice  of what statements  are  allowed.  For  both reasons,
it  should  be  invalidated.

.

But some  restrictions  on hate  speech  do not  run afoul of these
principles.  For example,  Stanford  now  forbids speech  that amounts
to  "harassment  by  personal  vilification. ' 74  (Stanford  is  a  private

university,  free  from  constitutional  restraint;  but it  has  chosen  to
comply  with  its  understanding  of  what  the  First  Amendment
means  as applied  to public universities.) 7 5  Under  the Stanford  rule,
speech  qualifies  as  regulable  "harassment"  if it:

(a)  is intended  to  insult or  stigmatize  an  individual  or  a small
number  of  individuals  on  the  basis  of  their  sex,  race,  color,
handicap,  religion,  sexual  orientation,  or  national  and  ethnic
origin;  and  (b)  is  addressed  directly  to  the  individual  or  indi-
viduals  whom  it  insults  or  stigmatizes;  and  (c)  makes  use  of
insulting  or  "fighting"  words  or  nonverbal  symbols. 6

To  qualify under  (c),  the speech  must by its  "very  utterance  inflict
injury or  tend to  incite to an  immediate  breach  of  the peace,"  and
must  be  "commonly  understood  to  convey  direct  and  visceral  ha-
tred  or  contempt  for  human  beings  on  the  basis  of"  one  of  the
grounds  enumerated  in  (b).7

The  Stanford  regulation  should  not  be  faulted  for  excessive
breadth. It  is  quite narrowly  defined.  Unlike  the  Michigan  rule,  it
does  not  reach  far  beyond  epithets  to  forbid  the  expression  of
views  on  public  issues.  On  an  analogy  to  the  obscene  telephone
call,  which  is  without  constitutional  protection 7 8  official  restric-
tions of the  sort represented  by the Stanford  regulation  should not
be  invalidated  under  the  First  Amendment.  If  this  general  ap-
proach  is  correct,  the  problem  of  hate  speech  should  turn  on
whether  the speech  at issue  plausibly  qualifies  as  a  contribution  to
the  exchange  of  ideas. 9  If it  does  not,  it  can  be  regulated  on  the
basis  of  the  relevant  showing  of  harm.

III.  NEUTRALITY

I have  not  yet  discussed  the  issue  of  selectivity.  The  Supreme
Court has  made  clear that  discrimination  on  the basis  of viewpoint
lies  at the  heart of  the free  speech  prohibition.8 0  For  example,  the
government  may  not draw  lines between  libel  of  conservatives  and

libel of liberals-even  if the  relevant  libel is  generally without con-
stitutional  protection.  Similarly,  the  government  could  not impose
special  penalties  on  fighting  words  directed  against  Republicans.

Under  current  law,  the  prohibition  on  selectivity  is  fatal  to
many  possible  restrictions  on  pornography  and  hate  speech.  I
think that the principle  is  unobjectionable-indeed,  it is  extremely
salutary.  But  the  principle  should  not  be  used,  as  it  now  is,  to
doom  narrowly  drawn  regulation  of pornography  and  hate speech.

A.  Pornography

The  antipornography  position  remains  poorly represented  not
only  in  popular  debate  but  also  in  current  constitutional  law.
Above  all,  the  position  is  said  to  run  afoul  of  the  prohibition  on
viewpoint  discrimination.  I suggest that  part  of what  has  made the
antipornography  approach  so  controversial  is that  it is  rooted  in  a
belief  that  there  is  something  like  a  caste  system  based  on  gen-
der-that  women  are  treated  unequally  to  men,  that  the  sexual
and reproductive  status  quo,  as  between  men  and  women,  is  itself
sometimes  a  place  for  inequality,  that  sexual  violence  by  men
against  women  is  a  greater  social  problem  than  sexual  violence  by
women  against  men,  and  that  social  inequality  can  be  both  ex-
pressed  and  perpetuated  through  sexuality.  The  rejection  of these
propositions-a  refusal  to  recognize  existing  inequality,  trans-
muted into  a  claim  of  partiality-has  proved  to  be critical  for  con-
stitutional  law. The  objection  here  is that  the  antipornography  po-
sition  is  selective  (especially  compared  with  the  antiobscenity
approach),  and that in  its  selectivity  lies  its  partisanship,  which  is
what makes  it fatally  inferior  to  its  competitors.

In the leading  decision  on the  subject, the United  States  Court
of  Appeals  for  the  Seventh  Circuit,  in  a  case  affirmed  summarily
by  the  Supreme  Court,  invalidated  an  antipornography  ordi-
nance."'  The  court  reasoned  that  an  argument  that  would  allow
regulation  of pornographic  materials  by  reference  to  the  harms  re-
ferred  to  above  is  worse,  not  better,  than  the  obscenity  approach.
Indeed,  it would  be  worse  than  the  obscenity  approach  even  if the
category  of  speech  suppressed  turned  out to  be  far  narrower  than
the  category  that can  be  suppressed  under  existing  law. According
to  the  court's  reasoning,  any  statute  that  imposed  penalties  on  a

subcategory  of  obscene  speech,  defined  by  reference  to  these
harms,  would  be  unconstitutional. s2

For  the  court,  the  key  point  is  that  such  an  approach  would
constitute  impermissible  "thought  control,"  since  it  would  "estab-
lish[  ]  an  'approved'  view  of women,  of how  they may  react to sex-
ual encounters,  [and]  of how  the  sexes  may  relate  to  each  other."8' 3
Under  the  antipornography  approach,  depictions  of sexuality  that
involve  rape  and violence  against  women may  be subject  to  regula-
tion, whereas  depictions  that do  not are uncontrolled.  It  is the non-
neutrality  of  antipornography  legislation-its  focus  on  violence
against  women-that  is  its  central  defect.  People  with  the  ap-
proved  view  can  speak;  people  with  the  disapproved  view  cannot.
That,  in  the  court's  view,  is  what  the  First  Amendment  centrally
prohibits.8 4

The  general  point seems  correct;  the  prohibition  on  viewpoint
discrimination  does  lie  at the  heart of  the  free  speech  guarantee.8 5
But especially  in  this  setting,  the  category  of viewpoint  neutrality
proves  far  more  difficult  to  understand  than  it  appears  at  first
glance.  First Amendment  law  contains  several  categories  of speech
that  are  subject  to  ban  or  regulation  even  though  they  are  non-
neutral  in  very  much  the  same  sense  as  antipornography  legisla-
tion.  Imagine,  for  example,  that  government  bans  advertising  in
favor  of  gambling  at  casinos.  This  restriction  seems  viewpoint-
based. Such bans  do  not simultaneously  prohibit  advertising  aimed
against gambling.  Nonetheless,  the  Supreme  Court  has upheld this
unquestionably  viewpoint-based  restriction. 6

96  Posadas v Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 US  328 (1986).  Perhaps  it would be  possi-
ble to  argue  that the restriction  is not really viewpoint-based,  because there  is  no real  cate-
gory called  "advertisements  against  gambling."  Speech  of that kind  is  really  a public-inter-
est announcement.  Real viewpoint discrimination  would consist  of a ban  on  "pro-gambling"
messages,  which  are  not  banned.  The  prohibition  on  advertisements  for  casino  gambling
does  not  prevent  people  from  advertising  their  view that  gambling  is  a good  idea.  On this
view, the  ban on  casino  gambling-and  the  other examples  offered  in the  text-are not real
examples  of viewpoint  discrimination.

I  do  not believe  that this  is  a persuasive  response.  It  amounts  to a  reshuffling  of the
categories, and does  not come  to terms with the real  discrimination  in  the examples.  People
cannot  buy  advertising  time  or  space  to  stimulate  demand  for  certain  activities,  whereas
people  can  do  precisely  this  in  order  to dampen  demand  for those  activities.

Courts  have  also  upheld  restrictions  on  cigarette  or  liquor  ad-
vertising  on  television 87-even 
though  there  are  no  restrictions  on
the  plentiful advertising  aimed  against the  smoking  of cigarettes  or
the  drinking  of liquor. These  restrictions  constitute  another  exam-
ple  of  acceptable  viewpoint  discrimination.  Perhaps  the  most vivid
illustration  of such  discrimination  is  the  ban  on  advertising  of un-
lawful  products  or  activities.18  I  cannot  sell  an  advertisement  for
cocaine  or  heroin,  even  though  the  government  permits  and  even
encourages  advertisements  designed  to  stop  the  use  of  drugs.
There  is  unambiguous  viewpoint  discrimination  in  this  state  of
affairs.

Most  people  agree  that  these  kinds  of  regulation  present  no
constitutional  problem.  The  reason  is  that the  restriction  is  based
on  such  obvious  harms  that the  notion  that  it  is  viewpoint-based
does  not  even  register.  Casino  gambling,  cigarette  smoking,  drink-
ing, and  use of  illegal  drugs  all  pose  obvious  risks  to both  self and
others.  Governmental  controls  on  advertising  for  these  activities
are  a  means  of  controlling  these  risks.

Or  consider,  as  another  example  of  viewpoint  discrimination,
the  area  of labor  law, where  courts  have held that  government  may
ban  employers  from  speaking  unfavorably  about  the  effects  of
unionization  in  the period  before  a union  election  if the  unfavora-
ble  statements  might  be  interpreted  as  a  threat  against  workers
who  support  unionization. 9 Regulation  of such  speech  is  plausibly
a form  of  discrimination  on  the basis  of  viewpoint,  because  it  does
not proscribe  employer  speech  favorable  to  unionization.  As  a final
example,  consider  the  securities  laws,  which  regulate  speech  in
proxy  statements.  Restrictions  on  viewpoint  can  be  found  here,
too.  Favorable  views  toward  a  company's  prospects  are  banned,
while  unfavorable  views  are  permitted  and  perhaps  even
encouraged. 9°

We  should  conclude  from  all  this  that  there  is  no  per  se  bar-
rier  to  viewpoint  discrimination.  Laws  that  silence  one  side  in  a
debate  are  given  a  strong  presumption  of  invalidity,  but the  pre-
sumption  can  be  overcome  in  certain  narrow  circumstances.  Those
circumstances  appear to  occur  when there  is  no  serious  risk of ille-
gitimate  government  motivation,  when  low-value  or  unprotected
speech  is  at  issue,  when  the  skewing  effect  on  the  system  of  free
expression  is minimal,  and  when the government  is  able  to make  a
powerful  showing  that  it  is  responding  to  genuine  harm.  When
these  requirements  are  met,  the  partisanship  of  the  regulation  is
not apparent  because  there  is  so  firm  a  consensus  on  the presence
of  real-world  harms  that  the  objection  from  neutrality  does  not
even  register.  The  spectre  of  partisanship  does  not arise  because  a
decision  to  control  the  speech  in  question  has  obvious  legitimate
justifications,  and  an  extension  of  the  prohibition  to  other  areas
appears  not  compelled  by neutrality  but instead to  be  an  unneces-
sary form  of  censorship.

The  point  suggests  that  the  Hudnut court  proceeded  to  its
conclusion  too  quickly;  it should  have  investigated  the  many cases
in  which  apparent  viewpoint  discrimination  is  acceptable.  Indeed,
the current  law  of obscenity  might readily be regarded  as non-neu-
tral. Along  some dimensions,  antiobscenity  law is not a bit less par-
tisan  than  antipornography  legislation.  The  line  drawn  by  existing
law  makes  it  critical  whether  the  speech  in  question  is  prurient
and  patently  offensive  by  reference  to  contemporary  community
standards.91 But  if  contemporary  community  standards  are,  with
respect to  offensiveness  and prurience,  themselves  partisan  and re-
flective  of  a  particular  viewpoint  (and  it would  be  most  surprising
if they  were  not),  then  a decision  to make  contemporary  standards
the  basis  for  regulation  is  impermissibly  partisan.  (Imagine  if  the
government  said  that  contemporary  community  standards  would
be  the  basis  for  regulating  depictions  of  race  relations.)  On  what
theory, then, can  antiobscenity  law  be treated  as  neutral  and  anti-
pornography  law  as  impermissibly  partisan?

I suggest that the answer  lies  in the fact that  antiobscenity law
takes  existing  social  consensus  as  the  foundation  for  decision,
whereas  antipornography  law  is  directed  against  that  consensus.
Existing  practice  is the target  of the  antipornography  approach, or
what  that  approach  seeks  to  change;  existing  practice  is  the  very
basis  of  the  antiobscenity  approach,  or  what  that  approach  seeks

to  preserve.  Obscenity  law,  insofar  as  it  depends  on  community
standards,  is  deemed  neutral  only  because  the  class  of  prohibited
speech  is  defined  by  reference  to  existing  social  values.  Anti-
pornography  legislation  is  deemed  impermissibly  partisan  because
the  prohibited  class  of  speech  is  defined  by  less  widely  accepted
ideas  about equality  between  men  and  women-more  precisely,  by
reference  to  a belief that equality  does  not always  exist  even  in the,
private  realm,  that  sexual  violence  by  men  against  women  is  a
greater  problem  than  sexual  violence  by women  against  men,  and
that  the sexual  status  quo  is  an  ingredient  in  sexual  inequality.

Along  the  axis  of  neutrality,  however,  there  is  no  sharp  dis-
tinction between  antiobscenity  and  antipornography  law. That dis-
tinction  would  be  plausible  only  if  existing  norms  and  practices
themselves  embodied  equality. Because  they do not, the distinction
fails.  Indeed,  one  could  imagine  a  society  in  which  the  harms  pro-
duced  by pornography  were  so  widely  acknowledged  and  so  gener-
ally  condemned  that  an  antipornography  ordinance  would  not  be
regarded  as  viewpoint-based  at all  but instead  as  a perfectly  natu-
ral response  to  harm-much  as the  Supreme  Court now  views  the
ban  on  child  pornography.9 2

I  conclude  that  the  argument  for  regulating  materials  that
combine  sex with violence  is more  powerful  than the  corresponding
argument  for  regulating  obscenity.  Since  perfectly  conventional
measures  regulating  speech  are  similarly  partisan  and  have  prop-
erly  been  upheld,  the  objection  from  non-neutrality  is  unpersua-
sive  here  as  well.  More  particularly,  the  standards  for  accepting
laws  that  contain  viewpoint  discrimination  seem  to  be  met  here.
There  are  sufficient  justifications  based  on  tangible  harms.  By  hy-
pothesis,  the  regulated  speech  is  low-value  under  any plausible  ap-
proach  to  valuation  under  the First  Amendment.

Moreover,  it  is  not  impermissibly  selective  to  aim  at material
that  contains  and  promotes  violence  against  women.  This is  so  es-
pecially  in  light  of  the  Constitution's  commitment  to  the  elimina-
tion  of  caste,  a  commitment  that  is  violated  by  disproportionate
violence  against  any  social  group  defined  in terms  of  a morally  ir-
relevant  characteristic.  It  should  be  recalled  here  that  the  Equal
Protection  Clause  was  originally  conceived  as  an  effort  to  counter-
act  the  disproportionate  subjection  of black  people  to  private  and
public  violence.  An  effort  to  counteract  the  disproportionate  sub-
jection  of women to  such  violence  is very much in keeping  with the

[60:795

aspirations  of  the  Equal  Protection  Clause.  Such  an  effort  should
not  be  deemed  inconsistent  with  neutrality.

I  do  not  claim  that  it  will  be  easy  to  design  regulations  with
sufficient  clarity  and  narrowness.  But it  is  those  questions  that  we
should be addressing,  not the  question of neutrality.  So long  as any
emerging law has the  requisite  clarity and  narrow scope, the appro-
priate forum  for  deliberation  on this contested  subject  is the demo-
cratic  process,  not the judiciary. The  Constitution  should  not bar a
narrowly  defined  prohibition  on  material  that  combines  sex  with
violence  against  women.

A  final  note.  Nothing  I have  said  here  argues  in  favor  of regu-
lation  of sexually  explicit  material  in general,  or, to take an  impor-
tant  and revealing  example,  of the  work  of  Robert  Mapplethorpe,
an  artist  who  was  recently  subject  to  criminal  prosecution  for  his
art  depicting,  among  other  things,  homosexual  relations.9 3  As  I
have  understood  it  here,  the  antipornography  argument  is  quite
specific  in its  aims. It  is not  directed against  sexually explicit mate-
rial  as  a  whole.  The  antipornography  argument,  rightly  under-
stood,  calls  for  strong  protection  of  speech  that  complains  explic-
itly  or 
implicitly  about  discrimination  against  homosexuals,
because  that  speech  is  "high  value"  in  the  relevant  sense  and  be-
cause  it  contains  few  or  none  of the harms  that  call  for  regulation
of  pornography.

B.  Hate  Speech

Are  restrictions  on  hate  speech  impermissibly  selective?  In
R.A.V.  v  City  of  St. Paul,9'  the  Court  invalidated  a  law  directed
against  a  certain  kind  of  hate  speech,  principally  on  the  ground
that  it  discriminated  on  the basis  of subject  matter. As  interpreted
by  the  Minnesota  Supreme  Court,  the  relevant  law  banned  any
fighting  words  that  produced  anger  or  resentment  on  the  basis  of
race,  religion,  or  gender."  The  R.A.V.  Court  emphasized  that  the
law  at  issue  was  not  a  broad  or  general  proscription  of  fighting
words. 96  Instead, the law  reflected a  decision to  single  out a certain
category  of  "fighting  words,"  defined  in  terms  of  audience  reac-
tions  to  speech about certain topics.9 7  Is  this  constitutionally  ille-

gitimate?  The  point  bears  on  almost  all  efforts  to  regulate  hate
speech.8

Subject  matter restrictions  are  not  all the  same.  We  can  imag-
ine  subject matter  restrictions  that  are  questionable  ("no  one  may
discuss  homosexuality  on  the subway")  and  subject  matter restric-
tions  that  seem  legitimate  ("no  high-level  CIA  employee  may
speak  publicly  about  classified  matters  relating  to  the  clandestine
affairs  of  the  American  government."9 )  As  a  class,  subject  matter
restrictions  appear  to  occupy  a  point  somewhere  between  view-
point-based  restrictions  and  content-neutral  ones.  Sometimes
courts  uphold  such  restrictions  as  a  form  of  permissible  content
regulation.  For  example,  the  Court  has  permitted  prohibitions  of
political  advertising  on  buses 0 0  and  of partisan  political  speech  at
army  bases. 10 1  These  cases show that there  is no  per  se ban  on sub-
ject  matter  restrictions.  When  the  Court  upholds  subject  matter
restrictions,  it  is  either  because  the  line  drawn  by  government
gives  no  real  reason  for  fear  about  lurking  viewpoint  discrimina-
tion,  or  (what  is  close  to  the  same  thing)  because  government  is
able  to  invoke  neutral,  harm-based  justifications  for  treating  cer-
tain  subjects  differently  from  others.  In  raising  this  issue,  hate
speech  restrictions  pose  many  of  the  same  problems  discussed
above  in  connection  with  pornography.

If the  subject  matter  restriction  in  the  cross-burning  case  is
acceptable,  it  must be  because  the  specified  catalogue  of regulated
speech  is  sufficiently  neutral  and  does not  alert the  judge to  possi-
ble  concerns  about  viewpoint  discrimination,  or  because  (again  a
closely overlapping  point) it  is plausible  to  argue that the harms, in
the  specific  covered  cases,  are  sufficiently  severe  and  distinctive  to
justify  special  treatment.  This  was  the  issue  that  in  the  end  di-
vided  the  Supreme  Court.

In  his separate  opinion  in R.A.V.,  Justice  Stevens  argued  that
the  harms  were  indeed  sufficiently  distinctive.  He  wrote:  "Just  as
Congress  may  determine  that  threats  against  the  President  entail
more  severe  consequences  than  other  threats,  so  St.  Paul's  City

Council may  determine that threats based  on the target's race,  reli-
gion, or gender  cause more  severe  harm to  both the target and soci-
ety than  other  threats."' 1 2  In  his  view,  "[t]hreatening  someone  be-
cause  of her  race  or  religious  beliefs  may  cause  particularly  severe
trauma  or  touch  off a riot.  .
. such  threats  may  be punished  more
severely  than  threats  against  someone  based  on,  for  example,  his
support  of  a  particular  athletic  team." 10 3  Thus  there  were  "legiti-
mate,  reasonable,  and neutral justifications"  for the special  rule.104
Justice  Stevens'  argument  is  highly  reminiscent  of  the  claim  that
antipornography  legislation  should  be  seen  as  an  acceptable  re-
sponse  to  harm  rather  than  an  imposition  of  a  point  of  view.

In  its  response,  the  Court  said  that  this  argument  "is  word-
play. ' !1 05  The  reason  that a  race-based  threat is  different  "is  noth-
ing  other  than  the  fact that  it is  caused  by a distinctive  idea,  con-
veyed  by  a  distinctive  method.  The  First  Amendment  cannot  be
evaded  that easily."10 6  But  at first  glance,  it  seems  that  a  legisla-
ture  could reasonably  decide  that  the harms produced  by this nar-
row  category  of  hate  speech  are  sufficiently  severe  as  to  deserve
separate  treatment.  Surely  it  seems  plausible  to  say  that  cross-
burning,  swastikas,  and  the  like  are  an  especially  distinctive  kind
of  "fighting  word"-distinctive  because  of  the  objective  and  sub-
jective harm they  inflict  on their  victims  and on  society  in general.
An  incident  of  cross-burning  can  have  large  and  corrosive  social
consequences.  A  reasonable  and  sufficiently  neutral  government
could  decide  that  the  same  is  not  true  for  a  hateful  attack  on
someone's  parents,  union  affiliation,  or  political  convictions.

A  harm-based  argument  of  this  kind  suggests  that  in  singling
out a  certain  kind  of regulable  speech  for  special  controls,  the  leg-
islature  is responding  not  to ideological  message,  but to  real-world
consequences.  Unlike  in  most cases  of  viewpoint  discrimination,  it
appears  that we have  no  special  reason for suspecting  government's
motives.  According  to Justice  Stevens,  a state  is  acting neutrally  if
it  singles  out  cross-burning  for  special  punishment,  because  this

kind  of  "fighting  word"  has  especially  severe  social  consequences.
According  to  the  Court,  on  the  other  hand,  a  state  cannot  legiti-
mately  decide  that  cross-burning  is  worse  than  (for example)  a vi-
cious  attack  on  your  political  convictions  or  your  parents.  A  deci-
sion to this  effect violates  neutrality.  But the Court's  conception  of
neutrality  seems  wrong. There  is nothing  partisan or  illegitimate  in
recognizing  that this unusual  class  of fighting  words  causes  distinc-
tive  harms.

My claim  here  is very narrow;  I do  not argue for  broad bans on
hate  speech.  Most  such  bans  would  indeed  violate  the  First
Amendment  because  they  would  forbid  a  good  deal  of  speech  that
is  intended  and  received  as  a  contribution  to  public  deliberation.
But  here  we  are  dealing  with  hate  speech  limited  to  the  exceed-
ingly  narrow  category  of  admittedly  unprotected  fighting  words.
The  argument  on  behalf  of  this  kind  of  restriction  might  benefit
from  Justice  Stevens's  analogy  to  the  especially  severe  legal  penal-
ties  directed  toward  threats  against  the  President.10 7  Everyone
seems  to  agree  that  this  restriction  is  permissible,  because  threats
against  the  President  cause  distinctive  harms  and  can therefore  be
punished  more  severely.  But if  the  government  can  single  out  one
category  of threats  for  special  sanction  because  of  the  distinctive
harm  that those  particular  threats  cause,  why  cannot  the  same  be
said  for  the  fighting  words  at  issue  here?

Justice  Scalia's  response  is  probably  the  best  that  can  be  of-
fered:  "[T]he  reasons why  threats  of  violence  are  outside  the  First
Amendment  (protecting individuals  from fear  of violence,  from the
disruption  that  fear  engenders,  and  from  the  possibility  that
threatened  violence  will  occur)  have  special  force  when  applied  to
the  President."1 08  But exactly  the  same  could  be  said  of  the  hate
speech  ordinance  under  discussion:  the justification  for the  fighting
words  exemption  has  special  force  because  of  the  context  of  racial
injustice.  Here,  as  in cases  involving  threats  against  the President,
we  are  dealing  with  a  subcategory  of  unprotected  speech  chal-
lenged  as  involving  impermissible  selectivity,  and  the justification
for  the  selectivity  involves  the particular  harms  of the  unprotected
speech  at issue.  That  justification  seems  sufficiently  neutral.

Consider  another  analogy.  Supplemental  criminal  penalties  for
racially-motivated  "hate crimes"  seem to  be  a well-established  part
of  current  law,  appearing  in  the  statutes  of  the  vast  majority  of

states. 0 9  Do those penalties  violate  the First Amendment?  In  Wis-
consin v  Mitchell,1 10  a unanimous  Supreme  Court  said that they do
not,  and  I  believe  the  Court  was  right.  But consider  the fact  that
the  government  imposes  the  additional  penalty  because  it  thinks
that  hate  crimes  create  distinctive  subjective  and  objective  harm.
The  distinctive  harm  is  produced  in  part  because  of  the  symbolic
or  expressive  nature  of hate  crimes.  This  justification  is  the  same
as  that  in  the  cross-burning  case.  This  does  not  mean  that  it  is
impossible  to  draw  distinctions  between  enhanced  penalty  statutes
and  "hate  speech"  laws.  But it  does  mean  that  if  the justification
for  the  hate  crimes  measures  is  sufficiently  neutral,  the  same
should  be  said  for  narrow  restrictions  on  hate  speech.

Perhaps  we  can respond  to  this claim  with the  suggestion  that
hate  crimes  are  not  speech-not  because  of discredited  versions  of
the "speech/conduct"  distifiction,  but  because  hate  crimes  are  not
intended  and  received  as  contributions  to  deliberation  about  any-
thing  and  do  not  communicate  ideas  of any  kind."'  This  was  one
of  the  Supreme  Court's  major  arguments  in  the Mitchell case.  Ac-
cording  to the  Court,  cross-burning  is  speech, whereas  hate  crimes
are unprotected  conduct." 2  Perhaps  laws  that regulate  conduct are
permissible  even  if some  of the relevant  conduct  is communicative.
Moreover,  it  may well  be  true  that most hate  crimes  do  not have  a
communicative  intention  or  effect.  But  some  certainly  do.  The
lynching  of  black  people,  for  example,  is  thoroughly  communica-
tive.  When  a  hate  crime  has  a  communicative  purpose,  are  en-
hanced  penalties  invalid  if  the  reason  for  enhancement  is  what  I
have  described?  I do  not believe  that  there  is anything  illegitimate
about  the state's  belief that  the subjective  and  objective  harm jus-
tify  enhancement.

In Mitchell, the Supreme  Court relied  heavily on  this belief." 3
For this  reason,  the  line  between  R.A.V.  and  Mitchell seems  quite
thin.  As  I  have  emphasized,  all  the justices  in  R.A.V.  agreed  that

the  expressive  acts  at issue  were  unprotected  by the First  Amend-
ment, because  the state  court had  said that the  statute was  limited
to  unprotected  "fighting  words."  R.A.V.  therefore  involved  consti-
tutionally  unprotected  acts,  just  as  Mitchell did.  And  everyone  in
Mitchell agreed  that the  First Amendment  issue  did not disappear
simply  because  conduct  was involved.  The Court said that  "a phys-
ical  assault  is not by any  stretch of the imagination  expressive  con-
duct  protected  by  the  First  Amendment"1 1 4;  but  it  rightly  added
that  a  genuine  First Amendment  issue  is  raised  when  a  state  "en-
hances  the maximum  penalty for  conduct  motivated by a  discrimi-
natory  point  of  view." 1 5

is  characteristically 

Understood  in these terms, R.A.V.  and Mitchell are very  close,
and  the  Court  did  not  adequately  explain  the  difference  between
them.  Perhaps  the  major  distinction  between  the two  cases  is  that
the  Minnesota  law  in  R.A.V.  covered  speech  as  well  as  expressive
expressive
conduct,  and  cross-burning 
the  enhancement  statute  was  directed  only  at  conduct,
-whereas 
and  many  hate  crimes  are  not intended  or received  as  a  communi-
cation  on anything  at all. For this reason,  the enhancement  penalty
can  perhaps  be  seen  as  a  content-neutral  restriction  on  conduct
that  is  not  ordinarily  expressive,  while  the  Minnesota  law  was  a
content-based  restriction  on  speech,  including  expressive  conduct.
This is  a reasonable  distinction.  But it  is  not clear  that the distinc-
tion  really  rescues  the  R.A.V.  outcome.  The  question  remains
whether  the  state  had  a  legitimate  justification  for  doing  what  it
did.  The  Mitchell Court  emphasized  that the  state  treated  "bias-
inspired"  conduct  more  severely  because  that  conduct  inflicts
"greater  individual  and  societal  harm." 11 6  This  was  Justice  Ste-
vens's  argument  in  R.A.V.,  and  it  seems  to  have  equal  weight  in
both  cases.

One  final  analogy seems  to suggest  that R.A.V.  is wrong  on the
neutrality  issue.  The  civil  rights  laws  say  that  you  may  not  fire
someone  because  of  his  race,  even  though  you"  may  fire  him  for
many  other  reasons.1 17  On one  view, the  civil rights laws  are there-
fore  unconstitutional,  because  they  penalize  someone  for  his politi-

cal convictions.  In  this respect,  they  are  similar  to  a prohibition  on
flag-burning.  They  single  out  conduct  (or  mere  words)  for  special
penalty  simply  because  of  the  message  communicated  by  that
conduct.

To be  sure, most discriminatory  discharges  are not intended  to
communicate  a  general  political  message,  but  some  discharges  do
have  such  an  intention.  It  would  be  most  adventurous,  to  say  the
least,  to  claim  that  the  First Amendment  prohibits  application  of
the  civil  rights  laws  to  politically-motivated  discrimination.  But if
R.A.V.  is right on  the issue of  neutrality, it  is  not simple  to explain
why  the  civil  rights  laws  survive  constitutional  attack.  Perhaps  it
could  be  said  that most discriminatory  discharges  are  not commu-
nicative  in  nature, and  that  the  claim  that  such  discharges  are  dis-
tinctly  harmful  has  a  sufficiently  neutral  justification.  Perhaps  it
could  be  said  that  the  civil  rights  laws  sweep  up  communicative
discharges  as  an  incidental  part  of  an  effort  to  prevent  a  class  of
activities  defined  in  terms  of  conduct  rather  than  expression.  But
if the justification  behind  the  civil  rights  laws  is  in fact  sufficiently
neutral,  the  same  seems  to  be  true  of  the  statute  in  the  R.A. V.
case.

The  arguments  from these analogies  are  not decisive. Plausible
distinctions  can  be  drawn.  But some  of the  distinctions  seem  thin.
I  conclude  that  as  the  Mitchell Court  held,  the  First  Amendment
is  not  violated  by laws  enhancing  the  punishment  of hate  crime.  I
also  conclude  that  no  serious  First  Amendment  problem  is  raised
by  the civil  rights  laws,  even  though  those  laws  sometimes  punish
speech.  And  a restriction  on  cross-burning  and  other  symbolic  hate
speech  is  a  permissible  subject-matter  classification,  so  long  as  the
restriction  is  narrowed  in the  way  described.

In  R.A.V.  the  Supreme  Court  offered  a  tempting  and  clever

response:

In  its  practical  'operation,  moreover,  the  ordinance  goes  even
beyond  mere  content  discrimination  to  actual  viewpoint  dis-
crimination.  Displays  containing  some  words-odious  racial
epithets,  for  example-would  be  prohibited  to  proponents  of
all  views.  But  'fighting  words'  that  do  not  themselves  invoke
race,  color,  creed,  religion,  or  gender-aspersions  based  upon
a  person's  mother,  for  example-would  be  seemingly  usable
ad  libitum  in  the  placards  of  those  arguing  in  favor  of  racial,
color,  etc.  tolerance  and  equality,  but  could  not  be  used  by

to  license  one  side of  a  debate  to  fight  freestyle,  while  requir-
ing  the  other  to  follow  Marquis  of  Queensbury  Rules. 118
The  short  answer  to  this  argument  is  that  the  ordinance  at issue
does  not  embody  viewpoint  discrimination  as  that  term  is  ordina-
rily understood.  Viewpoint  discrimination  occurs  if the government
takes  one  side  in  a  debate,  as  in,  for  example,  a  law  saying  that
libel  of the  President  will  be  punished  more  severely  than  libel  of
anyone  else.  Viewpoint  discrimination  is  not  established  by  the
fact  that  in  some  hypotheticals,  one  side  has  greater  means  of  ex-
pression  than  another,  at  least-and  this  is  the  critical  point-if
the  restriction  on  means  has  legitimate,  neutral justifications.

We  can  make  this  point  by  reference  to  the  fact  that  it  is  a
federal  crime  to threaten  the life  of  the President.  Recall  that  the
Supreme  Court  said  in  R.A.V.  that  such  statutes  are  permissible
even  though  they make  distinctions  within  the  category  of  unpro-
tected  threats.  Imagine  the  following  conversation:  John:  "I  will
kill the President."  Jill:  "I will kill  anyone  who threatens to kill  the
President."  John  has  committed  a  federal  crime;  Jill  has  not.  In
this  sense, the presidential threat case  involves  the same kind of de
facto  viewpoint  discrimination  as  the R.A.V.  case.  If it  is  not  un-
constitutional  for  that reason"'-and  the  Court indicated  that it  is
not-the  Court  should  not  have  found  the  statute  in R.A.V.  view-
point  discriminatory.

The  point  has  general  implications.  It  suggests  that  the  state
can  attack  hate  speech  dealing  with  certain  matters,  as  Stanford
has  done,  without  running  afoul  of the  prohibition  on  impermissi-
ble selectivity.  It  also suggests that some narrowly drawn  viewpoint
discriminatory  restrictions-protecting  against  hate  speech  di-
rected  at blacks  or  women-might well  be  permissible.1 2 0  Thus, for
example,  a  locality  might  decide  that  cross-burning  and  hate
speech  directed  against blacks  pose  special  risks  not posed  by  hate
speech  directed  against  whites.  For  the  reasons  I  have  outlined,  I
do  not  believe  that  there  is  anything  illegitimate  about  a  public
judgment  that hate  speech  against  blacks  creates  distinctive  sub-
jective  and  objective  harm.

C.  Hate  Speech,  Neutrality,  and  the  University

In  the  previous  Section,  I  argued  for  the  constitutionality  of
narrow  restrictions  on hate  speech,  but R.A. V. suggests  that  courts
might  invalidate  such  restrictions  as  unacceptably  selective.  After
R.A.V.,  a  university might  well  be  forbidden  to  single  olit for  pun-
ishment  speech  that  many  universities  want  to  control:  (a)  a  nar-
rowly  defined  category  of  insults  toward  such  specifically  enumer-
ated  groups  as blacks,  women,  and homosexuals;  or  (b)  a narrowly
defined  category  of  insults  directed  at  individuals  involving  race,
sex,  and  sexual  orientation.  Under  current  law,  a  restriction  that
involves  (a)  is  viewpoint-based,  and  to  that  extent worse  than  the
restriction  in R.A. V.  itself. A  restriction  that  involves  (b)  is  a  sub-
ject-matter  restriction,  not based  on viewpoint, 121 but it  is  still im-
permissibly  selective  in  the  same  sense  as  the  restriction  invali-
dated  in  the R.A.V.  case.  We  might  think  that  the  conclusions  in
R.A.V.  are incorrect  in principle, because  there  are  sufficiently neu-
tral  grounds  for  restrictions  (a)  and  (b):  A  public  university  could
neutrally  decide  that epithets  directed  against  blacks,  women,  and
homosexuals  cause  distinctive  harms.1 22 But this  conclusion  is hard
to  reconcile  with  the  R.A.V.  decision.

If  such  conclusions  are  to  be  resisted-if R.A.V.  does  not  ap-
ply  to  the  campus-it  must  be  because  public  universities  can
claim  a  degree  of  insulation  from judicial  supervision.  The  princi-
pal  point  here  is  that  colleges  and  universities  are  often  in  the
business  of  controlling  speech,  and  their  controls  are  hardly  ever
thought to raise  free  speech  problems.2 3  There  are  major limits  on
what  students  can  say  in  the classroom.  For  example,  they  cannot
discuss the presidential  election  if the  subject  is math. The  same is
true  for  faculty members.  Universities  also  impose  restrictive  rules
of decorum  and  civic  participation.  A  teacher  can  even  require  stu-
dents  to  treat  each  other  with basic  respect.  It  would  certainly  be
legitimate  to suspend  a student  for  using  consistently  abusive  lan-
guage  in  the  classroom,  even  if  that  language  would  receive  firm
constitutional  protection  on  the  street  corner.

The  problem  goes  deeper.  A  paper  or  examination  that  goes
far  afield  from  the  basic  approach  of  the course  can  be  penalized
without  offense  to  the First  Amendment.  Usually  the  penalty  is  a

form  of  subject-matter  restriction,  but  it may  well  turn  out to  be
viewpoint-based  in  practice.  In  many  places,  a  student  who  de-
fends  fascism  or  communism  is  unlikely  to  receive  a  good  grade,
and  not  only because  it  is  hard  to argue  well  on  behalf  of  fascism
or  communism.  Viewpoint  discrimination  is undoubtedly  pervasive
in  practice,  and even  though  it  is  usually objectionable,  courts  can-
not and perhaps  should not attempt to police it.  This is not so  only
for  judgments  about  student  performance.  Initial  hirings,  tenure,
and  promotion  all  involve  subject  matter restrictions,  and  in prac-
tice  viewpoint  discrimination  as  well.

These  examples  do  not  mean  that  any  and  all  censorship  is
acceptable  in  an  academic  setting.  It  does  not  even  mean  that  ex-
isting  viewpoint  discrimination  is  constitutionally  acceptable.  A
university can  have  a good  deal of power  over  what happens  in the
classroom,  so  as  to  promote  the  educational  enterprise,  without
also  being  allowed  to  decree  a  political  orthodoxy  by  discriminat-
ing  on  the  basis  of  viewpoint.  If  a  public  university  were  to  ban
students  from  defending  certain  causes  in political  science  classes,
a  serious  free  speech  issue  would  be  raised.  There  are  therefore
real limits to  permissible  viewpoint  discrimination  within the  class-
room,  even  if it  is hard for  courts  to police  the  relevant boundaries.
Certainly  the university's  legitimate  control  over the  classroom
does  not  extend  to  the  campus  in  general.  A  university  could  not
say  that  outside  of  class,  students  can  talk  only  about  subjects  of
the  university's  choice  (excluding,  say,  a war,  or  feminism,  or  race
relations,  or  AIDS).  From  these  various  propositions,  we  might
conclude  that  the  university can impose  subject-matter or other
restrictions on speech only  to  the extent  that the restrictions are
reasonably related to  its educational mission. If a university  is  to
educate,  it  must  discriminate  on  the  basis  of  quality  and  subject
matter,  and  these  forms  of  discrimination  will  inevitably  shade
over  into certain  forms  of viewpoint  discrimination.1 2  But in  cases
in which the  educational  mission is not reasonably  at stake, restric-
tions  on  speech  should  not  stand.  Certainly  this  would  be  true  in
most cases in  which  a university  attempts  to  impose  an  orthodoxy,
whether  inside  or  outside  the  classroom.

How  does  this  bear  on  the  hate  speech  issue?  Perhaps  a uni-
versity  could  permissibly  conclude  that  its  educational  mission  re-
quires  unusually  firm  controls  on  this  kind  of speech,  so  as  not to

124  In this  respect,  the  question  of speech  restrictions  in the  university  is  close  to  the
question  of selective  funding  of art. See Sunstein,  The Partial Constitution at 308-15  (cited
in  note  3).

compromise  the  values  of  education  itself.  The  university  might
think,  for  example,  that  it  has  a  special  obligation  to  protect  its
students  as  free  and  equal  members  of  the  community.  It  might
believe  that  certain  narrowly  defined  forms  of  hate  speech  are
highly  destructive  to  the students'  chance  to  learn.  Perhaps  a  uni-
versity  should  have  more  leeway  to  restrict  hate  speech  than  a
state  or locality, precisely  because  it  ought  to  receive the benefit  of
the  doubt  when  it  invokes  concerns  of  this  kind.  At  least  courts
should  be  reluctant  to  second-guess  judgments  of  this  sort  when
the university can  plausibly  claim  that  it  needs  a relatively  narrow
restriction  in  order  to  safeguard  the  educational  mission.

This point bears  on two  issues. First, it  suggests  that universi-
ties  might  be  allowed  to  enact  mildly  broader  restrictions  than
states  and  localities.  The  educational  mission  ought  to  grant  the
university  somewhat  greater  room  to  maneuver,  especially  in  light
of  the  complexity  and  delicacy  of  the  relevant  policy  questions.
Second,  the  point  suggests  that  courts  should  be  reluctant  to  find
viewpoint  discrimination  -or  impermissible  selectivity.  Perhaps
there  should  be  a presumption  in  favor  of  a university's  judgment
that hate  speech  directed  at blacks  or  women,  or  showing  racial  or
gender  hatred, produces  harm that  is  especially  threatening  to  the
educational  enterprise.

This  conclusion  is  buttressed  by  two  additional  factors.  First,
there  are  numerous  colleges  and  universities;  many  students  can
choose  among  a range  of  alternatives,  and  a restriction  in one, two,
or  more  imposes  an  extremely  small  incursion  into  the  system  of
free  expression.  Colleges  that  restrict  a  large  amount  of  speech
may  find themselves  with  few students.  Second,  the  Constitution is
itself committed  to the elimination  of  second-class  citizenship,  and
this  commitment  makes  it  hard  to  say  that  an  educational  judg-
ment  opposed  to  certain  narrowly  described  forms  of  hate  speech
is  impermissibly  partisan.

I  think that an  analysis  of this  kind makes  sense  for  narrowly
defined  hate  speech  restrictions.  Consider  the  Stanford  regulation
described above.  If a public  university adopted  that restriction, the
major  constitutional  problem,  fueled  by  the  outcome  in  R.A.V.,
would  not  be  breadth  but  unacceptable  selectivity.  Why  has  the
university  not  controlled  other  forms  of  "fighting  words,"  like  the
word  "fascist,"  or  "commie,"  or  "bastard"?  Does  its  selectivity
show  an  impermissible  motivation?  Should  we  find  its  selectivity
to be  impermissibly  partisan?  I  do  not think that  we  should.  Not-
withstanding  R.A.V.,  a  university  could  reasonably  and  neutrally
decide  that the  harms  caused  by  the  regulated  fighting  words  are,

at  least  in  the  university  setting,  more  severe  than  the  harms
caused  by  other  kinds  of fighting  words.

IV.  CONDUCT  As  SPEECH,  WORDS  As  CONDUCT

Free  speech  law  has  been  bedeviled  by  the  "speech-condu~t"
distinction.  In  this  Section,  I  argue  that  some  forms  of  conduct
should  be  treated  as  speech,  but  that  some  words  should  not  be
treated  as  speech.  A  general  conclusion  follows  from  the  argument:
The  constitutional  protection  of  "speech"  refers  to something  that
we should  consider  a term  of art. That term  covers  all symbols  that
are  intended  and received  as  expressing  messages.  Under  this view,
some  words  are  not  "speech"  within  the  meaning  of  the  First
Amendment,  and  some  "conduct"  does  qualify  as  speech.  Under
this  view,  we  should  make  no  rigid  distinction  between  "speech"
and  "conduct."  We  should  distinguish  instead  between  words  and
conduct,  with  the  understanding  that  the  Constitution  protects
speech,  a term  that  includes  some,  but hardly  all,  words  and  con-
duct.  And  under  this  view,  a  theory  of  free  speech  value,  referred
to  in  Section  I,  helps  explain  why  some  conduct  is  regulable  only
(a)  on  a  content-neutral  basis  or  (b)  when  government  can  make
the  ordinary  showing  required  for  restriction  of  political  speech.

A.  Conduct  As  Speech

What  counts  as  speech  within  the  meaning  of  the  First
Amendment?  Justice  Black  famously  thought  that  the  Constitu-
tion  protected  "speech"  absolutely  and  "conduct"  not at all.125  But
no  purely  formal  test  can tell  us  what  falls  within  the two  catego-
ries.  Someone  burns  a flag  as  part of  a war  protest.  The  "conduct"
communicates  ideas.  Moreover,  it  communicates  ideas  in  a distinc-
tive  way.  Should  it  be  excluded  from  the  category  of  "speech"?
Surely  not.  "Speech"  consists  of  symbols  that  communicate
messages. 128  Words  are  simply  one  kind of symbol.  The  category  of
speech is  not coextensive  with  the  category  of words.  Flag-burning,
insofar as  it  is a  symbol that  communicates  a message,  is  speech. It
may  be  regulable  on  a  content-neutral  basis,  or  even  on  the  basis

121 See  Cohen  v  California, 403  US  15,  27  (1971)  (Blackmun  dissenting)  (an  opinion
that Justice  Black  joined,  arguing  that  petitioners'  action  was  unprotected  because  it  was
conduct and  not speech);  see  also  Thomas  Emerson,  The System  of Freedom of Expression
8,  17-18  (Random House,  1970)  (making  an  expression-action  distinction).

of  content  when  there  is  harm  of a  certain  nature  and  degree,  but
that is  a  different  matter.

Words  then are  signs-symbols  of expressive meaning.  But the
category  of  symbols  of  expressive  meaning  is not  limited  to  words.
Sign  language,  for  example,  does  not consist  of words,  but it is  en-
titled to  constitutional  protection. The  same is true for the "act"  of
7  or  of joining  a  demonstration. 128 The  con-
wearing  an  armband,12
stitutional  protection  of  speech  should  not  stop  with  words.  The
term  "speech"  is  best  understood  to  include  all  symbols  of expres-
sive  meaning,  whatever  the form  of those  symbols.

The  point seems  inescapable  if we  accept the view  that speech
qualifies  for protection  if it is intended  and received  as  a contribu-
tion to social  deliberation  about some  issue.  If speech  is entitled  to
special  protection  because  and  when  it  does  this,  any  sharp  line
between  "words"  and  "expressive  conduct"  becomes  extremely  ar-
tificial.  Some  forms  of  conduct,  like  flag-burning,  have  an  expres-
sive and  communicative  character.  Their  purpose  and effect  are  to
express  a political  message.  They  are  part of social  deliberation.  In
this way they  qualify as  "speech,"  regulable  only if the  government
can  generate  a  strong,  sufficiently  neutral justification.  Or  suppose
that we  accept a  narrower  understanding  of the  free speech  princi-
ple,  believing  speech  to  be protected,  or  specially protected,  if and
only if  it is  connected  with  democratic  processes.  A  sharp  line be-
tween  words  and  expressive  acts  cannot  be  justified  in  terms  of
democratic  values, for  much expressive  conduct  is intended  and re-
ceived  as  a  contribution  to  democratic  discussion.  The  constitu-
tional  protection  covers  "speech";  acts  that  qualify  as  signs  with
expressive  meaning  should  qualify as  speech within the meaning  of
the  Constitution.

This  is  hardly  to  say  that the  government  can  never  regulate
expressive  conduct.  On the contrary,  government  often does  have  a
special  and  sufficiently  neutral  justification  for  regulating  such
conduct.  Protection  of  the  President  from  assassination,  or  the
Lincoln Memorial  from graffiti, 129  can be supported  by reference  to
powerful,  legitimate  reasons,  such  as  keeping  the  peace  and  pro-
tecting  public monuments.  When the government  regulates  expres-
sive  conduct,  it is  usually trying  to promote  a  purpose  entirely un-
related to the  suppression  of  communication.  But some  restrictions
on  expressive  conduct,  like  those  on  flag-burning,  may well  not  be

supportable  in  this  way.  Thus  in  the  flag-burning  cases,  the  Su-
preme  Court  emphasized  that the  government  did not  have  a  rea-
son  for  regulation  independent  of  the  government's  objection  to
the  ideas  that  flag-burning  embodies.  The  justification  for  regula-
tion  was  illegitimate.1 30

On  this  view,  the  speech-conduct  distinction  has  been  made
necessary  not because  expressive  conduct  is undeserving  of protec-
tion,  but  because  government  frequently  has  a  sufficiently  strong
and  neutral justification  for  regulating conduct.  The key  to the  dis-
tinction,  often  thought to  lie  in  the  determination  of whether  the
conduct  qualifies  for  initial  protection,  actually  lies  in the fact that
government  often  has  good  reasons  for  regulating  it-just as  it  has
good  reasons  for  applying  the trespass  laws  to  political  demonstra-
tions." 1  Now  that  much  expressive  conduct  has  been  understood
to  qualify for protection,  courts  can focus  on  what is really the cen-
tral  question:  the  existence  of  acceptably  strong  and  neutral
justifications.

Thus  far,  then, we  have  seen  that  conduct  carrying  a political
message  qualifies  as  speech  within  the  meaning  of  the  First
Amendment.  The  same  conclusion  rightly  follows  for  other  con-
duct, like  dance,  that  is both  expressive  and  communicative  even  if
nonpolitical.  When 
is  expressive  and  communicative  but
nonpolitical,  such  conduct belongs  in  a second  tier of protection,  at
least  if we  accept  a two-tier  view  of the  First  Amendment. 32  Such
speech  is  regulable  more  easily than  political  speech, but  it  is  pro-
tected  in  the  absence  of  neutral justifications.'3 3

it 

1 o  See  id  at  410-14;  United States v Eichman, 496  US  310,  315-18  (1990).
131  See  Adderley  v  Florida, 385  US  39  (1966).
131  See  Sunstein,  Democracy and the Problem of Free Expression ch  5  (cited in  note
22).  On this view,  government would have the power to regulate  some forms of (for example)
nude  dancing.  Such  dancing  does warrant  at least a degree  of First  Amendment  protection.
It  is both communicative  and expressive. But a  state could plausibly  decide that some kinds
of nude dancing  are  associated  with  a range  of serious  real-world  harms, including  prostitu-
tion, criminal  activity  of various  sorts, and  sexual  assault.  See Barnes v  Glen Theatre, 111  S
Ct 2456,  2468-71  (1991)  (Souter  concurring).  At  least  this  is  so  if  government  can  muster
evidence that the regulated form  of nude  dancing does  produce these harms,  which  would be
sufficient  to  justify  regulation  under  the  lower-tier  speech  standards.  I  conclude  that the
Supreme Court  was probably  correct to rule  that the First Amendment did not protect nude
dancing in  the Kitty Kat  Lounge. Id  at 2463.  This is  so even  if the majority erred in  empha-
sizing the  state's  moral  reservations  about public  nudity  rather  than  the  existence  of more
tangible harms. See id  at 2461-63.  Of course,  a quite different  issue  would be raised in  a case
in  which  nude  dancing  was  part  of  a  political  protest,  or  if the  particular  acts  could  not
plausibly  be associated  with  real-world  harms.

... It  is  insufficient to  respond that if people want  to convey a  message,  they  should  be
required  to  do  so  through  words  rather  than  action.  A  message  cannot be  so  readily  sepa-
rated from  the particular  means chosen  to express  it;  if the  means are  changed,  the message

I  conclude  that  what  is  apparently  conduct  should  qualify  as
speech  for  First  Amendment  purposes  if  it  is  intended  and  re-
ceived  as  an  effort  to  communicate  a  message.  This  conclusion
might  seem  to  have  extreme  consequences-for  example,  an  at-
tempted  assassination  of the  President  may well  qualify as  speech.
It  does not  raise  anything  like  a serious  free  speech  question, how-
ever,  because  government  can  invoke  strong  content-neutral  rea-
sons  for  protecting  the  President's  life.  But under  this  test, flag-
burning,  draft-card  burning,  and  cross-burning  all  qualify  as
speech;  indeed  this  classification  is  the  easy  part  of  the  relevant
cases.

B.  Words  As  Conduct

We  have  seen  that some  of  what is  familiarly  characterized  as
"conduct"  actually  counts  as  speech.  The  converse  may  also  be
true. Suppose  that  the  head  of a  computer  company  asks  the head
of  other  computer  companies  whether  they  might  not  agree  to  fix
prices.  Suppose  we  have  nothing  but talk,  but the  talk produces  a
conspiracy  in  violation  of  the  Sherman  Act.  Or  suppose  that  an
employer  discharges  an  employee  by  saying,  "I  don't  want  people
of  your  religion  to  work  for  me."  There  is  no  free  speech  problem
in  either  case.  But  it  is  not  easy  to  explain  why.

I  suggest  that  we  might  distinguish  among  (a)  speech  that
amounts  to the  commission  of an  independently  illegal  act  or that
is  evidence  that  the  act  has  been  committed;  (b)  speech  that  cre-
ates  or  constitutes  conditions  that  can  constitutionally  be  made il-
legal;  (c)  speech  that  leads  immediately  to  illegality;  (d)  speech
that  is  produced  as  a  result  of  illegality;  and  (e)  speech  that  leads
proximately,  but not immediately,  to illegality  or  otherwise  to  con-
stitutionally  cognizable  harm. My hypothesis  is  that  speech  falling
in  category  (a)  is  properly  treated  as  action,  even  if  it  consists
solely  of words.  Words  and  conduct  that fall  within  categories  (b),
(c),  (d),  and  (e)  all  qualify  as  speech,  and  they  may  be  regulable
only  under  the  standards  set out  in  Sections  I  and  IV.A.

Let us  start with  a straightforward  explanation for  the  words-
conduct  distinction.  Perhaps  words  are  classified  as  conduct  when
they  offer  no  ideas.  If  the First  Amendment  protects the  exchange

changes  too. Form  and content cannot be distinguished  so simply. Flag-burning conveys  the
relevant  message  more  sharply  and  distinctively than  anything  else.  If  the speaker  says  in-
stead,  "My country  is  doing  wrong,"  the  message  will  be  so muted  as to be  fundamentally
transformed.  The  availability  of purely  verbal alternative  forms of expression  cannot  there-
fore  justify  failing  to protect  expressive  conduct.

of ideas, then price-fixing  agreements,  threats, bribes,  and unlawful
discharges  probably  do  not  count  as  speech  within  the  meaning  of
the Amendment.  Alternatively,  suppose that  the  First Amendment
protects  speech  that is  intended  and received  as  a  contribution  to
social  deliberation  about some  issue,134  or that  words  deserve  to  be
treated  as  speech  when  their  regulation  would  be  an  insult to  the
moral autonomy of the speaker  or the listener.13 5 On either  of these
views,  the  suppression  of some  words  may  not threaten  the values
that underlie  a  system  of  free  expression  and  may  be justified  if
there  are  sufficient  real-world  harms.

On  this  view,  the  treatment  of  some  words  as  "conduct"  pro-
vides  a  shorthand,  if misleading,  description  of  a  more  extended
argument  that the speech  at issue  does  not promote  First Amend-
ment values  and  creates  sufficient  harms to  be  regulable under  the
appropriate  standards.  Here,  the  regulation  of  the  relevant  forms
of  speech  does  not  really  stem  from  a  distinction  between  speech
and  conduct,  but  instead  from  an  argument  about  value  and
harms.  When  it  is  said  that  certain  speech  is  regulable  as  "con-
duct,"  what  is  actually  meant  is  that  the  speech  at  issue  lies  far
from  the  center  of  constitutional  concern  and  that  it  is  harmful
enough  to  be  regulable.

This much  seems  true;  but I want to  try a different  argument.
Perhaps  some  cases  involve  something  that  is  properly  character-
ized  as  conduct  rather than  speech.  The  written  or  oral  statement,
"You're  fired,"  is an  act,13 6 not  merely speech, in the  sense that the
words  are  simply  a  way  of committing  an  unlawful  discharge.  The
statement,  "I  agree  to fix prices  with you,"  is  a way of fixing prices,
indeed  the  most  efficient  way  of  doing  so.  These  words  do  not
merely  cause  action;  they  constitute  the  relevant  action.  The same
appears  to  be  true  of  purely  verbal  sexual harassment.  If someone
says to  an  employee,  "Sleep  with  me  or  lose your  job,"  we  say that
he is committing  an act  of harassment. The words  do not cause the
act.  The  words  are the  act. The  same  is  plausibly  true  of bribery,
perjury, and  threats. Most  free  speech  cases-even  those in  which
people  lose  their  free  speech  claims-are  very different.  If a politi-
cal  revolutionary  encourages  someone  to  take  over  a  building,  we
may have  incitement,  and it may  be  regulable;  but it is  not action.

This  argument  suggests  that  some  statements  are  properly
classified  as  conduct  because  they  amount  to  the  commission  of
acts  that  are  legitimately  and  independently  made  unlawful.  For
example,  a  racially  motivated  discharge  is  low-value  speech  that
creates  harms  sufficient  to  justify  regulation.  But  we  can  also  say
that  the  discharge  is  an  independently  unlawful  act.  A  purely  ver-
bal  discharge  is  simply  a means  of  committing  the unlawful  act.

We  are  now  prepared  to  offer  some  distinctions.  The  state-
ment,  "You're  black,  and therefore  fired,"  is  a  version  of  (a).  The
words  are  simply  a means  of  committing  an  independently  unlaw-
ful  act;  they  are that  act.  Sexual  harassment  can  be  analyzed  in a
broadly  similar  fashion.  If  someone  says,  "Sleep  with  me  or  lose
your job,"  the  statement  is  a way  of  violating  the  civil  rights  laws.
Or  suppose  that  an  employer  posts  violent  pornography  all  over
the workplace,  so  that wherever  a woman  goes,  she  sees  sexual vio-
lence  aimed  against women.  It  would be  fully plausible  to  say  that
posting the pornography  violates  the  civil rights  laws.1 37  We  could
conclude  not that  the  posting  "leads  to"  or  "causes"  such  a  viola-
tion,  but that  it  is a  violation.

But, on  reflection,  the  sexual  harassment  cases fall in  category
(b) rather  than  (a).  They  differ from  a discriminatory  discharge  in
that  the  latter  is  independently  illegal,  and  the  words  are  simply
evidence  that  a discriminatory  discharge  has taken  place.  They are
evidence  of  the  illegality  because  a  pretextually  work-related  but
really discriminatory  discharge  is  also illegal,  even  if discriminatory
words  were  not  used.  When  the words  are  used  in  court,  they  are
evidence  of  the  underlying  illegality,  that  is,  the  discharge  based
on  a  discriminatory  motive.  It  is  the discharge  itself that is  unlaw-
ful.  There  remains  the  question  whether  a  discriminatorily  moti-
vated  discharge  can  be  made  unlawful  consistently  with  the  First
Amendment;  I have  discussed  this  issue  in  Section  III,  and  in  any
case  R.A.V.  seems  to  suggest  that  Congress  can  constitutionally
outlaw  a  general  category  of  acts  that  includes  some  expressive
conduct.  My basic  claim  here  is  that  certain  verbal  expression  is  a
way  of  performing  an  illegal  act,  and  that  there  is  no  problem  in
classifying such  expression  as the act itself, at least when the words
are  evidence  that  the  illegality  has  occurred.

Purely  verbal  sexual  harassment  can  be  made  illegal,  but it  is
not  evidence  of  an  independently  illegal  act.  Instead  it  creates  or

constitutes  conditions  that can  be  made  unlawful.  This  is  true for
quid  pro  quo  harassment;  it  is  also  true  of  the  "hostile-environ-
ment"  harassment,  including  the pornography  case.  Both  of  these
are  versions  of  (b),  and  in  an  important  way  different  from  (a).
Cases  that  fall  in  category  (b)  are  harder  than  those  in  category
(a).  They  are  harder  because  the  government  is  targeting  words
themselves  rather  than  words  as  evidence  of  an  independent  ille-
gality. Often  the government  might  want to claim  that a statement
amounts to  the  commission  of an  illegal  act, or  helps  create  condi-
tions  that violate  some  law.  Whether  it  can  do  so  depends  on  the
ordinary  standards  applied  to  regulation  of speech.  In other  words,
government  must  say  something  about  the  issues  of  value  and
harm.  The  view  that  sexual  harassment  is  regulable  under  (b)  de-
pends  on  a  resolution  of  those  issues.

At  least  in  the  ordinary  run  of  cases,  no  serious  free  speech
question  is raised  by  legal  controls  on  purely verbal  sexual  harass-
ment. This  is not because  such harassment  is  conduct, but because
it  belongs  in  a  lower  tier  of  protection,  and  because  the  relevant
harms  are  sufficient  to  justify  regulation.  A  full  justification  of
these  claims  would  require  a  more  extended  statement  than  I  can
offer  here.  But it  seems  clear  that workplace  harassment  is  not in-
tended  and  received  as a contribution  to the  exchange  of ideas,  and
also  that  it  is  not  closely  connected  with  speaker  or  (especially)
listener  autonomy.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  the  prevention  of  dis-
crimination  seems  clearly  sufficient  to  override  the  relatively  weak
free  speech  interests.

Many  cases  of "speech  brigaded  with  action"'' 8  are  really  ver-
sions  of  (c).  Consider  the words  "Ready,  Set, Fire"  said to  a firing
squad;  or, "Kill,  Rover"  said to  a trained attack  dog.'$9  These cases
do  not  involve  conduct,  and  they  are  also  quite  different  from  (a)
and  (b).  We  should  think  of them  as  low-value  speech  causing  im-
mediate  harm,  and  therefore  as  readily  bannable.  But they  do  not
count  as  conduct  or  action  standing  by themselves.

How  do  pornography  and  hate  speech  fare  under  this  ap-
proach?  I believe  that they  generally  fall in  categories  (d)  and  (e).
Category  (c)  is  inapplicable  because  imminent  harm,  let  alone  in-
tended  harm,  can  rarely  be  connected  with  any  particular  mate-
rial. 14 0  If the government  is trying  to  regulate the material  because

10  Thus  the  standards  in  Brandenburg are  not  likely  to be  met.

it  was  produced  through  illegality-case  (e)-it is  trying  to  regu-
late  speech,  not  conduct.  If  there  is  illegality  in  the production  of
the material,  the  case  may involve  acceptable  regulation  under  cat-
egory  (d)  but not  because  the  material  is  itself  "conduct."  Under
existing  law,  category  (e)  does  not allow for  regulation.' 14  It  follows
from  all  this  that  we  cannot  justify  regulation  of hate  speech  and
pornography  on  the  ground  that  these  forms  of speech  constitute
action-although  the  presence  of  action  in  the  production  of
materials,  or  action  as  a result  of  the  use  of the  materials,  may  be
relevant  to  the First  Amendment  inquiry. An  interesting  question
is  whether  we  can  use  the  pornography  in  the  workplace  exam-
ple-category  (b)-as a  ground  for  saying  that  some  pornography
is  action,  analytically  speaking.  At  this  point  it  is  not  easy  to  see
how  this argument  can  be made  persuasively.  I conclude  that most
pornography  is  speech,  not  conduct,  but that  it  is  sometimes  ban-
nable  for  the  reasons  stated  in  Sections  I  and  IV.A.

V.  FUTURE  STRATEGIES

I  have  questioned  the  outcomes  in  both  R.A.V.  and  Hudnut.
But so  long  as those  decisions  stand,  there  are sharp  constitutional
limits  on  regulation  of  hate  speech  and  pornography.  It  is,  of
course,  important  to  inquire  whether  current  law  is  correct,  espe-
cially  in  light  of  the  fact  that  free  speech  doctrine  sometimes
changes  rapidly. But it  would be  most disappointing  if those  inter-
ested  in  eliminating  the  harms  caused  by  pornography  and  hate
speech were  to  restrict themselves  to  criticizing  what may  well be-
come  firmly  entrenched  law.  An important  task  for  the  future  will
be  to  develop  responses  to  the  new  legal developments.  When  por-
nography  is  harmful,  what  approaches  should  be  taken  by  those
concerned  with  minimizing  the relevant  harms?  If we  aim  to elimi-
nate  caste-like  features  of  current  systems,  what approaches  would
make  sense?

It  is  clear  that  the  prevention  of violence  against  women-an
important  aspect  of  these  caste-like  features-might  be  made  a
greater  priority  of  state  and  federal  government.  There  are  sub-
stantial  initiatives in this  direction,  quite outside of the category  of
speech.4 2  These  initiatives,  sometimes  criticized  as  an  unjustified
incursion  into  the  federal  structure,  fit  exceedingly  well  with  the

post-Civil  War  Constitution,  which  has  as  one  of  its  purposes  the
use  of federal  authority  to prevent  the  disproportionate  subjection
of certain  groups to  public and  private  violence. It seems clear,  too,
that sexual  violence  is  not  only  an  inadequately  enforced  crime;  it
is  also  an  inadequately  addressed  tort. There  should  be  a  range  of
civil  actions  against  people,  including  pornographers,  who  have
abused  children  and  women  in  the  home  or  in  the  production  of
their  work.  An  important  advantage  of  this route  is  that the  "rea-
sonable  doubt"  standard  of  criminal  law  need  not be  met, and  re-
covery  can  occur  under the civil law's  more  lenient "preponderance
of  the  evidence"  standard.  Here  the  First  Amendment  issues  are
trivial.  Well-publicized  tort actions  might  also deter  criminal  activ-
ity  and  spur  new  statutory  initiatives.

Moreover,  content-neutral  laws  might  be  invoked  to  prevent
hate  speech,  hate  crimes,  and  injuries  that  result  from  pornogra-
phy.  For  example,  the  law  of  trespass  can  and  should  be  used
against  cross-burning.  Universities  can use  general  requirements  of
civility  and  decent  behavior  to  stop  hate  speech-not  as  part  of
specialized  speech  codes,  but as part of  a less  selective  ban  on  con-
duct on  campus  inconsistent  with educational  requirements.  Prose-
cutors  can  pay  special  attention to  criminal  acts  that reflect  racial
hatred  or  misogyny.  We  should  encourage  greater  enforcement  ef-
forts  to  protect  against  child  pornography.  Current  obscenity  law
offers  considerable  opportunity  to  proceed  against  materials  that
involve  violence  or  coercion  in  their  production  and  use.  When  al-
locating  scarce  resources,  prosecutors  should  proceed  against  such
materials,  not  against  materials  that  are  offensive  because  of their
sexual  explicitness.

We  should  also  encourage  much  more  experimentation  with  a
wide range  of different  kinds  of legal  approaches  to  the problem  of
pornography.  There  is no  reason  for localities to  believe themselves
bound  to take the judicially-invalidated  Dworkin/MacKinnon  ordi-
nance  as the  universal  model for regulation  of pornography.  A  con-
stitutional  banality  is  pertinent  here:  One  of the  principal  advan-
tages  of  a  federal  system  is  that  it  offers  enormous  scope  for
experimentation.  R.A.V.  and  Hudnut, taken  together,  mean  that
courts  will  quickly  strike  down  many  imaginable  regulations  of
pornography.  In  these  circumstances  it  makes  sense  to  have  a
broad  range  of proposals,  in  order  to  escape  the problems  of  selec-
tivity, vagueness,  and  overbreadth. 14 3  Some  localities  might  try, for

example,  to regulate  a subcategory  of speech  that  is  already regul-
able  under  Miller.  Other  localities  might  combine  the  obscenity
and  pornography  approaches  and  exempt  from  control  all  speech
with serious  social value.  Those  are  simply  some  of a  large number
of  possible  experiments  designed  to  do  some  good  while  increasing
the  chances  of judicial  validation.

Finally,  private  or  public  pressure  might  be  brought  to  bear
against material that sexualizes violence,  especially  when  the mate-
rial  appears  on  television  or  in  movies.  A  promising  model  is  pro-
vided  by  an  innovative  measure  enacted  through  the  initiative  of
Senator  Paul  Simon  in  1990.144  Senator  Simon's  statute  exempts
from the antitrust  laws  any  effort  by the  television  networks  to  re-
duce  violence  on  television.  This  measure  does  not  require  any
agreement  among  the  networks.  It  does  not  censor  any  speech. 145
But it  does  say  that  an  agreed-upon  set  of principles  will  not  vio-
late  the antitrust laws.  In  this way, it  encourages  networks  to reach
agreements  that would  otherwise  be  unlawful.

The  Simon  initiative  is  especially  valuable  insofar  as  it  recog-
nizes  that  competition  for  viewers  can  lead  to  an undesirable  state
of affairs,  one  in which  there  is  an increasing  incidence  of violence.
In  late  1992,  the networks  did  indeed  reach  a  shared  set of  princi-
ples. 4
s The  agreement  should  significantly  affect  programming  in
1993  and  after.  Among  other  things,  the  new  principles  say  that
programs  should  not  depict  violence  as  glamorous  or  as  an  accept-
able  solution  to  human  conflict;  should  avoid  gratuitous  violence;
and  should  avoid  mixtures  of  sex  and  violence.  Perhaps  it  will  be
possible to build on  this idea to counteract  some of the problems  of
the  broadcasting  media,  without  resorting  to  government  regula-
tion  at  all.

145  There  is,  however,  a  possible  First Amendment  issue  under the R.A.V.  decision.  It
would  clearly  be  unlawful  to  exempt  from  the  antitrust  laws  any  agreement  to limit  criti-
cism  of the  President. The question  then becomes  whether  a  subject matter exemption,  lim-
ited to  violence,  is  unacceptably  selective  in  the  same  sense  as  the  law invalidated  by  the
R.A.V.  Court.  I  do  not believe  that there  is unacceptable  selectivity  in  the light  of the  ab-
sence  of  viewpoint  discrimination,  the  plausibility  of  the  claim  of  harm,  and  the  lack  of
reason  for  suspicion  about  viewpoint  discrimination.

Words,  Conduct, Caste

CONCLUSION

I have  made  three  claims  in this  Essay. First, certain  narrowly
defined  categories  of  pornography  and  hate  speech  can  be  regu-
lated  consistently  with  the  First Amendment.  They  count  as  "low
value"  speech,  and  they  cause  sufficient  harms  to  be  regulable
under  existing  standards.  Broadly speaking,  the argument for  regu-
lating  pornography  is  stronger  than  the  corresponding  argument
for  regulating  hate  speech,  on  both  the  value  and  the  harm  sides;
but some well-defined  categories  of hate speech  might be subject  to
legal  controls.  Second,  the  prominent  objections  from  neutrality
are  misplaced.  Some  regulations  of  pornography  and  hate  speech
can  be  neutrally  justified,  even  if  they  appear  discriminatory  on
the  basis  of  content,  subject  matter,  or  even  viewpoint.  They  can
be  neutrally  justified  in  large  part because  of the  anticaste  princi-
ple.  Third,  we  should jettison  the  "speech-conduct"  distinction  in
favor  of  an  approach  that  explores  whether  the  symbols  at  issue
are  intended  and  received  as  a  contribution  to  the  exchange  of
ideas  about  some  issue.

Under  this  approach,  flag-burning,  cross-burning,  and  much
else  will  qualify  as  speech,  though  it  may  be  bannable  because  of
sufficiently  neutral  justifications.  Under  this  approach,  moreover,
some  "words"  do  not  qualify  as  speech,  because  they  amount  to a
way  of  committing  an  independently  unlawful  act.  These  claims
raise  many questions  and  leave  a  number  of ambiguities.  But they
will  resolve  the vast majority  of issues  raised  by  government  regu-
lation  of  pornography  and  hate  speech  and  help  orient  treatment
of  the  rest.

I have  also outlined  a number  of possible approaches  for  those
who  seek  to  prevent  the  harms  produced  by  pornography,  hate
speech,  and  hate  crimes.  A  particular  priority  is  to  attack  those
harms  through measures  that (a) do  not implicate speech  at all and
(b)  are  content-neutral  if they  do  implicate  speech.  Strategies  of
this  kind  cannot  counteract  all  of  the  harms  produced  by  hate
speech  and pornography.  But they  can do  a great deal  of good, and
so  long as  Hudnut and R.A. V. stand as  the law, they  are, I suggest,
among  the  best routes  for  the  future.

A  more general  lesson  follows  from these  claims.  The  concerns
about  pornography  and  hate  speech  are  in  one  sense  new,  but  in
another  sense  very  old;  they  recall  the  original  goal  of  the  Civil
War  Amendments:  the elimination  of caste  systems.  As I have  em-
phasized,  the  caste-like  features  of current  practices  are  not  as  se-
vere as  those  of traditional  caste systems,  but they  are  nonetheless

conspicuous.  An  important  element  of  those  practices  consists  of
the  disproportionate  subjection  of women  and  blacks  to public  and
private  violence  and  to  frequent  intrusions  on  their  self-re-
spect-the  time-honored  constitutional  notion  of  stigma. 147  Many
imaginable  limits  on  sexually  explicit  materials  and  on  racist
speech  would  indeed  violate  the  First Amendment.  But, I  suggest
that  narrow  and  well-defined  legal  controls  on  pornography  and
hate  speech  are  simply  a  part  of  the  attack  on  systems  of  racial
and  gender  caste.  If they  are  understood  in this  light,  and  if they
are  appropriately  narrow  and  clear,  they  can operate  without  mak-
ing  significant  intrusions  into  a  well-functioning  system  of  free
expression.
