FUTURE:  FINAL  REPORT  OF  THE  ADVISORY  COMMITTEE  ON  PUBLIC  INTEREST  OBLIGATIONS  OF
DIGITAL  TELEVISION  BROADCASTERS  (1998).  Many  of the  arguments  in  this  Article  were  framed
through  the  opportunity  to  see,  through  work on  the Advisory  Committee,  two groups  close up.  The
first was  a  large  number  of broadcasters-most  of them public-spirited,  most  of them  extremely
nervous  about  growing  competition  from  cable  and  elsewhere,  most  of them  sharply  opposed  to
government  mandates,  few  of them  unwilling  to  accept  governmental  help.  The  second  was  the
National  Association  of Broadcasters  (NAB)-at the  time  an  extraordinarily  defensive,  fearful,
uncooperative,  aggressive,  and self-protective  organization,  consisting of many  honorable people,  but
often unwilling to compromise  or even to  reflect. In this way,  the NAB was reminiscent of the tobacco
industry in, say, the 1960s,  and was enthusiastic  about using the First Amendment  in the same way  that
the National Rifle  Association  uses  the Second  Amendment,  that is,  as  an all-purpose  shield  against
any  action  adverse  to  their  interests.  The  author  is  grateful  to  other  members  of  the  Advisory
Committee  for many helpful discussions  of these problems  and, in  particular, to  the  two co-chairs  of
the Committee, Norman Ornstein  and Leslie Moonves. The Committee's final report has influenced the
treatment here, not least when  there  are disagreements.  He is  also  grateful, for  helpful comments,  to
Douglas Lichtman,  Eric  Posner, and Richard Posner,  and to participants  in a conference  held in  honor
of Jiirgen  Habermas  in Frankfurt,  Germany  in July  1999, especially  Clause Offe,  Bernhard Peters, and

TELEVISION AND  THE PUBLIC INTEREST

Television  and the Public Interest

Cass R. Sunstein

The communications revolution has thrown into question the value of
imposing public interest obligations on  television broadcasters. But  the
distinctive nature of this unusual market-with "winner-take-all"features,
with  viewers  as a commodity,  with pervasive externalities from private
choices, and with market effects  on preferences as well as the other way
around-justifies a continuing role for government regulation in the public
interest. At the same time,  regulation best takes the form, not of anachro-
nistic command-and-control regulation, but  of (1)  disclosure require-
ments,  (2)  economic incentives ("pay  or play"), and  (3)  voluntary self-
regulation through a privately administered code.  Some  discussion is
devoted to free speech and antitrust issues, and to the  different possible
shapes of liability and property rules in this context, treating certain pro-
gramming as a public "good" akin to pollution as a public bad.

INTRODUCTION

There is  a large  difference between  the public interest and what inter-
ests  the public.  This  is  so  especially  in  light  of the  character  and  conse-
quences  of the  communications  market.  One  of the  central  goals  of  the
system  of broadcasting,  private as well as public,  should be to promote the
American  aspiration  to deliberative  democracy.'  a system in which citizens
are  informed  about public issues  and able  to make judgments  on the basis
of reasons.  Both norms  and law should be enlisted in this  endeavor;  if one
fails,  the  other becomes  all the  more important.  These  are the  claims  that I
attempt to bring to bear on the  so-called communications  revolution.

This  revolution  has  been  driven  by  extraordinary  technological
change.2  The  rise  of  cable  television,  the  Internet,  satellite  television,
direcTV,  and digital television has confounded  ordinary  understandings  of
"television.' 3  Before long,  digital  television may enable  viewers  to  choose

among over a thousand  programs.4  The possible  combination  of television
and  the  Internet,  a  combination  now  in  its  early  stages,  may  prove  an
equally  dramatic  development;  the  fact that the Internet  is  a partial  substi-
tute  for  television  has  already  introduced  a  measure  of  competition
between the two.5

Law has  responded to  these  developments  in fits  and starts,  largely  by
attempting  to  engraft legal  requirements  designed  for the  old environment
onto  an altogether  new communications  market. The result is a high degree
of  anachronism,  misfit,  and  drift,  and  in  the  view  of many  observers,  a
series  of constitutional violations.6  Most  of the  modem  debate  involves  a
vigorous  but increasingly  tired  contest  between  those  defending  the  old
regulatory  order7  and those  urging rapid  movement  toward  "simple  rules"
for government control  of television, above all well-defined  property rights
and  freedom  of  contract!  Strikingly  similar  debates,  about  the  value  of
"simple  rules,"  the  place  of regulatory  safeguards,  and the  role  of televi-
sion in  a democracy,  can be found in  many nations. 9

My  aim in this Article is  to discuss  an important part  of the  intersec-
tion  between  the  emerging  communications  market and  law:  public inter-
est obligations imposed on television  broadcasters."  Since the initial rise  of
broadcasting  in the  United  States,  government  has treated  the license  as  a
kind of "grant"  that is legitimately  accompanied  by  duties."  Congress  and
the  FCC have  required broadcasters  to  follow  a range  of requirements-a
form  of  old-style  "command-and-control"  regulation,  growing  out  of an

I use  this term  to refer  to literal broadcasters,  and  thus  not  to include cable providers.  As we
will  see,  however,  the  distinction  between  the two  seems  increasingly  (though  not  yet  entirely)
artificial,  and much of the discussion will bear on the appropriate regulatory  stance toward  television in
general.

TELEVISION AND  THE PUBLIC INTEREST

understanding  that there would be three, and only, three, private broadcast-
ing stations.  Much, though far from all, of this regulation was eliminated  in
the  1980s. 12  A large question  is  the extent to  which public interest  require-
ments continue  to make sense,  or even to  survive constitutional  scrutiny,  in
an  entirely  different communications  market where  broadcasters  occupy  a
decreasingly  distinctive position.

The  question  was  posed  starkly  with  the  enactment  of  the
Telecommunications  Act  of  1996,3  one  of  whose  central  concerns
involved  the rise of digital television. The  Act had to  deal with two issues.
First, who  would have  the right to  broadcast digital television?  Should the
licenses  be  sold,  or auctioned,  or given  outright to  existing broadcasters?
Second, what public interest  obligations,  if any,  should  attach to  the  own-
ership  of a right to  broadcast digital television? The Act  squarely answered
the  first question, 4  but  was  inconclusive  on  the  second.  In  an  extremely
controversial  step,  Congress  did  not sell  or auction  the right to  broadcast
digital  television,  but basically  gave  the right  to  existing broadcasters  for
free.'  This has been described,  and reasonably  so, as a "huge giveaway"  of
"a  $70  billion  national  asset."'"  At the  same  time,  Congress  refused  to
eliminate  public interest  obligations,  delegating  to  the  FCC  the  power  to
decide  whether  such  obligations  should  be imposed  on  digital  television
broadcasters,  and  if so,  in  what  form."  The  FCC has  not  yet  made  that
decision or even commenced  formal proceedings.

In this Article,  I offer  two basic  claims,  one involving ends,  the other
involving  means.  The  first  is  that  in  view  of  the  character  and  conse-
quences  of television programming,  any  system for the regulation  of tele-
vision  should  be evaluated  in democratic  as  well  as economic  terms.  The
economic  ideal  of "consumer  sovereignty"  is  ill-suited  to  the communica-
tions  market.  It follows  that, at  least in the  near  term,  the changes  intro-
duced  by the  emerging  communications  system do not justify  abandoning
the  idea  that broadcasters  should  be  required  to  promote  public  interest
goals.  Educational  programming  and  programming  that  deals  with  civic
questions  can  promote  the  aspiration  to  deliberative  democracy;  reliance

on  an unregulated  market may  not.  There  are  also  legitimate  grounds  for
encouraging  broadcasters  to  make programming  accessible  to  people  with
disabilities,  above  all the hearing  impaired.  I emphasize  in  this connection
some special characteristics  of the broadcasting  market,  characteristics  that
make it hazardous  to rely on "consumer sovereignty"  as the  exclusive basis
for regulatory  policy.  Instead  communications  policy  should  be assessed,
at least in part, by reference to  its effects  on the public  sphere."

My  second  claim is  that in order  to  promote  the  relevant goals,  gov-
ernment  should  decreasingly  rely  on  command-and-control  regulation, 9
and  should  consider instead  three less  intrusive  and more  flexible  instru-
ments,  each  of which  is  well-adapted  to  a  period  of rapid  technological
change.  The instruments  are:  (1)  mandatory  public  disclosure  of informa-
tion  about  public interest  broadcasting,  unaccompanied  by  content regula-
tion;  (2)  economic  incentives,  above  all  subsidies  and  "play  or  pay";
and  (3)  voluntary self-regulation,  as through  a "code"  of appropriate  con-
duct, to  be  created  and operated  by  the  industry  itself. These  instruments
have played  an increasing  role in regulatory policy  in general,  especially  in
the environmental  arena?Â° But  they have rarely  been discussed  in the  area
of  communications,  where  they  have  a  natural  place;2'  and  despite  its
growing  importance,  the  general  topic  of  industry  self-regulation  has
received little academic attention.22

By requiring  broadcasters  to  disclose  information  about  their public
interest  activities,  the government  might  be able  to enlist  public pressure
and social  norms  so  as to  create  a kind  of competition  to  do more and  bet-
ter.  This is  the  simplest  and least intrusive  of regulatory  instruments.  By
allowing  broadcasters  to  buy  their way  out of certain  public interest  obli-
gations,  the  government  should  be  able  to  ensure  that  those  with  an

TRANSFORMATION  OF  THE  PUBLIC  SPHERE  (Thomas  Burger  trans.,  1989)  (offering  an  extended
historical  discussion).

19.  A  question  not addressed  here is  the  content of any  minimal  requirements;  I emphasize  the
more flexible  alternatives  as the instruments  of choice, without  denying the need  for some minima  as a
"backstop."  In the current system, for example,  it may well make sense to require a degree of children's
programming  and  also free  air time for  candidates. See ADVISORY  COMMITTEE  ON  PUBLIC  INTEREST

mandatory programming  is beyond the scope  of the present discussion,  though I do refer  to mandates  at
several  points below.

TELEVISION AND  THE PUBLIC  INTEREST

incentive  to  produce  good programming  are  actually  doing  so,  while also
producing  the  lowest-cost  means  of promoting  public  interest  program-
ming.  And by  encouraging  (not mandating)  voluntary  self-regulation,  the
government can help  overcome  a kind of prisoner's  dilemma faced by par-
ticipants  in  a  "winner-take-all"  market, I  a  prisoner's  dilemma  that
contributes  to a range  of social  problems,  often  stemming  from a kind of
"race to the bottom" with respect to programming  quality.

It should  be clear  that this basic  approach  combines  a recognition  of
the  serious  limits  of unrestrained  communications  markets  in promoting
social  goals with a plea for rejecting traditional regulation  and for enlisting
more flexible,  market-oriented  instruments  in the  service  of those  goals.
This approach  is consistent  with some incipient but quite general  trends in
regulatory  law. 4 If the approach  is  sound, it is  well-suited to the emerging
communications  market;  but it  is  easily  adapted  to  other  areas  as  well,
including environmental  degradation,  occupational  safety  and health,  and
other social problems.  It is  much too soon to  say  whether  there is a "third
way"  between traditional command-and-control  regulation  and reliance  on
free trade and well-defined  property rights.'s  But if there is  indeed  a "third
way," it is likely to be found in proposals  of this kind.

A  general  theme  of this  Article  is  that  disclosure,  economic  incen-
tives,  and voluntary  self-regulation  might  displace government  command-
and-control in a variety  of areas of regulatory law.  Specific  themes include
requiring  producers  simply  to  disclose  goods  and  bads;  relaxing  antitrust
law so  as to  permit  cooperation  designed to reduce  some  of the problems
associated with "races  to  the bottom";  and building  on emerging  develop-
ments  in  environmental  protection  so  as  to  allow  far  more  imaginative
"trades"  among  producers.  In short, it is time to  move beyond the view that
market  ordering  and  content regulation  are  the  only two  possibilities  for
communications  law.  There  are  many  alternatives,  and real  progress  can
come only from exploring  the choices  among them.

The  Article  comes  in seven  parts.  Part I sets  the stage,  outlining  the
history  of regulation,  identifying  some  relevant  puzzles,  and  exploring
some diverse problems  with television  in its current form. Part II,  the theo-
retical  heart  of  the  Article,  evaluates  and  rejects  the  claim  that  in  the
emerging media  market there  is  no longer room for public interest regula-
tion of any kind. I suggest that television  is  no ordinary commodity,  partly

because of the  collective  benefits  of good programming,  partly because  of
the link between  television  and  democracy,  and partly because  viewers are
more  like  products  offered  to  advertisers  than  consumers  paying  for
entertainment  on their  own. Part  I  discusses  the  relation between  princi-
ple and practice;  it traces  likely stages  of the emerging market,  with broad-
cast  programming  becoming  increasingly  like  general-interest  magazines.
Part IV deals  with disclosure,  exploring  the possibility  that relevant private
groups,  invoking  widespread  social  norms,  can  interact  to  produce
improvements  in  the  broadcasting  market  without  compulsory  program-
ming of any  kind. Part  V  deals  with  economic  incentives,  beginning  with
the  idea  of "play  or pay,"  and  then  adapting  some  ideas  from  the  law  of
tort to  the  law of broadcasting.  Part VI examines  whether  a code of broad-
casting  might  operate  as  a  kind  of  positional  arms  control  agreement,
helping to  counteract  a  situation in which broadcasters  compete  to the  det-
riment  of  collective  goals.  Part  VII  is  a  brief  summary  of  regulatory
options.

HISTORY,  PUZZLES,  PROBLEMS
A.  A Brief Historical Overview26

Broadcast  licenses  have  never  been  treated  like  ordinary  property
rights, open  for sale on the  free market.27  Since  the initial enactment of the
Communications  Act  of  1934,  the  government  has  awarded  licenses
to  broadcasters  in  accordance  with  "convenience,  public  interest,  [and]
necessity."'  The  Federal  Radio  Commission  early  described  the  system
as  one  in  which  broadcasters  "must  be  operated  as  if  owned  by  the
public....  It is  as  if a community  should own a  station  and turn  it over  to
the  best  man  in  sight  with  this  injunction: 
'Manage  this  station  in  our
interest ....  ",29 Under this  "public trustee"  standard,  the  FCC has imposed
a range  of obligations  on broadcasters-an  idea that perhaps made  special
sense  when a small number  of companies dominated  the  television market.
In  its  initial  set  of  guidelines,  the  FCC  required  stations  to  meet
the  "tastes,  needs,  and  desires  of  all  substantial  groups  among  the
listening  public...  ."  This required  "a well-rounded  program,  in  which

entertainment,  consisting  of music  of both  classical  and  lighter  grades,
religion,  education  and instruction,  important public  events,  discussions of
public questions,  weather, market reports, and news, and matters of interest
to  all members  of the family, find a place."31

Often this kind of guidance  operated  as a general  plea, with little sys-
tematic  enforcement.  In  1960, however, the FCC went so  far as to outline
fourteen  of  the  "major  elements  usually  necessary  to  meet  the  public
interest."3 2 These included:  religious programming,  programs  for children,
political  broadcasts,  news  programs,  sports  programs,  weather and market
services,  and  development  and use  of local  talent.33  The  FCC  eventually
specified its  general guidelines,  which were  merely indicia of the types  and
areas  of  appropriate  service.  The  specifications  included  minimum
amounts  for  news,  public  affairs,  and  other  nonentertainment  program-
ming, including the  controversial "fairness  doctrine"'  and also  access rules
for prime-time. 5

Substantial  changes  occurred  in  the  1980s,  a  period  of  significant
deregulation.  The  head of the FCC,  Mark  Fowler,  declared  (in  a kind  of
soundbite,  or bumper-sticker,  for the  market  approach  to  the  topic)  that
television  is  "'just  another  appliance,'  a "'toaster  with pictures."'3 6  The
fairness  doctrine  was  largely eliminated,  and  many  of the more particular
public  interest  requirements  were  removed?'  Nonetheless,  a  number  of
such requirements  remain. For example,  the  FCC continues  to  say that if a
broadcaster  sells  airtime  to  one  candidate,  it  must  sell  similar  time  to
opposing  candidates  as  well.  Congress  itself has  codified  a right  of this
kind?8 A  long-standing  statutory  provision,  in the  obvious  self-interest  of
law makers,  requires  that if a broadcaster offers  to  sell time,  it must do  so
at  the  "lowest unit rate  of the  station"  during  the forty-five days  before  a

primary  election  and during the  sixty  days before a general or special  elec-
tion. 9

In recent  years  Congress  has  devoted  special  attention  to  children's
programming  and  to  television  access  for the hearing  impaired.  In  1990,
Congress  enacted  the  Children's  Television  Act  of  1990,' 
limiting  the
advertising  on  children's  programming  (twelve  minutes  per hour  during
weekdays  and  ten  and a half minutes per hour on weekends).41  Under this
statute,  the FCC has further required broadcasters  to provide  three hours  of
children's  programming  per week. 42  The Television  Decoder Circuitry  Act
of  1990"3  requires  new  television  sets  to  have  special  decoder  chips,
allowing  them to  display  closed-captioned  television  transmissions  for the
hearing  impaired.  The  Telecommunications  Act  of  1 9 9 644  requires  use  of
"v-chip"  technology,  designed  to  facilitate  parental  control  over  what
enters  the home;  it also contains  ancillary  requirements  intended  to  ensure
"ratings"  of programming  content.45

B.  Two Puzzles

Turn now to the present, or at least to the more recent past. From  1997
to  1998,  a presidential  advisory  committee  met to  discuss  the public inter-
est obligation  of television  broadcasters.46  Several  of the  broadcasters  on
the  Committee  were  quite  skeptical  about  governmental  mandates,  but
highly receptive  to the  idea of adopting some kind of broadcasting  "code,"
akin to  the kind approved  and  administered  by the  National  Association  of
Broadcasters  (NAB) between  1928 and  1979. 41 The Committee  eventually
moved  toward endorsing  the  notion  of a  code,  and the idea received  con-
siderable  attention in the trade press.4

In its annual  meeting,  however,  the  NAB  signaled  skepticism  about
the  idea and  came  very  close  to  saying  "no"  and "never."  A large  part  of
the  broadcasters'  objection  was that any  "code"  would violate the  antitrust
laws.  This was  very  odd because in their discussions,  members of the NAB

TELEVISION AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST

treated  the  possibility  of  an  antitrust  violation  as  extremely  good  news.
Take  this  as  the  first puzzle;  it is  not often that  high-level  corporate  offi-
cials  are  smiling  when  they  discuss  the  possibility  that  their own  action
would be found unlawful.

Consider  a second puzzle. During the  committee's deliberations,  some
people  argued on behalf  of a "play  or pay"  system, in  which broadcasters
would  be relieved  of public  interest  obligations  (to  "play")  if they  agree
instead to  "pay"  someone  else-another broadcaster-to  do  so. But many
of the  broadcasters  on the committee  were quite skeptical  of this approach,
arguing  that public interest  obligations  were  part  of the  (sacred?)  duty  of
every  broadcaster,  and  that no  one  should  be exempted  for a price.  This
was  also  very  odd.  It is  not often that high-level  corporate  officials  prefer
rigid  government  mandates  to  more  flexible  approaches.  What  explains
these  puzzles?  The answers-offered  in closing here4 9-- reveal  a great deal
about the emerging  market.

C. 

Identifying the Problem

To  evaluate  particular  proposals,  it  is necessary  to  have  a  concrete
sense  of why some people  think that even well-functioning  television mar-
kets are inadequate.  Consider the following possibilities,  each of which has
produced public  concern in the last decade:50

1.  There may be insufficient  educational programming  for children.
The  existing  fare  may  be insufficient  because  there  is  too  little
simply  in  terms  of  amount  (for example,  for  people  who  lack
cable),  or because  children do not watch the stations  on which it
is available,  or because the quality is too low.

2.  Programming  may not be  sufficiently  accessible  to people  who
are hearing impaired;  this may be a particular  problem if citizens
are unable  to find out about emergencies,  or if they are unable  to
understand  programming  that  bears  on  central  public  issues."
The  exclusion  may  have  practical  consequences;  it  may  even
produce a form of humiliation. 2

3.  At  least  on  the  major  networks,  programming  may  be  too
homogenous,  in  a  form  of  "blind-leading-the-blind"  program-
ming. Since  a significant percentage  of Americans do not receive

cable  television  and  depend  on  broadcasters,  the  result  may  be
insufficient  variety in programming."

4.  Some programming  may be affirmatively bad for  children  if, for
example,  it contains  excessive violence,  or otherwise encourages
behavior  that is  dangerous  to  self and  others.  The result  of such
programming  may be to  produce  violent or otherwise  dangerous
behavior in  the real world."

5.  There  may  be too  much  violent  programming  in  general,  with
adverse  consequences  for adults, not  only children! 5 The  adverse
consequences  may  include  an  increase  in  violence  (because  of
changes  in social  norms  or "copycat"  effects56), general  demor-
alization  and fear, or a misperception  of reality.

6.  News  coverage  may  be  a  form  of  "infotainment,"  dealing  not
with real  issues, but with gossip  about celebrities  and  unsubstan-
tiated charges  of various kinds. 7

7.  There  may be  too little coverage  of serious  questions,  especially
during  political campaigns.  The relevant  coverage  may  involve
sensationalism  and  "sound  bites,"  or attention  to  who  is  ahead
("horse-race  issues") rather  than who  thinks  what  and  why.  The
result may be an insufficiently informed citizenry. 8

8.  Stations  too rarely  cover  international  issues  or developments  in
other nations.  The result is that people  are extremely  ill-informed
about the global  background  for national  events,  including pro-
posed financial  assistance  and possibly  even war, and  also  about
practices  other than their own.  This ignorance  makes  it difficult

A glance at the situation shows that the physical  and  external  means of collecting information
in  regard  to what is  happening  in  the  world have far  outrun the  intellectual  phase  of inquiry
and  organization  of its results.  Telegraph,  telephone,  and  now the  radio,  cheap  and  quick
mails ...  have  attained a remarkable  development.  But when  we  ask what sort of material  is
recorded  and how  it is  organized,  when  we  ask  about  the  intellectual  form  in  which  the
material is  presented,  the tale to  be told is  very  different.  "News"  signifies  something  which
has  just  happened,  and  which  is  new  just  because  it  deviates  from  the  old  and
regular...  [W]e have  here  an  explanation  of the triviality  and  "sensational"  quality  of so
much  of what  passes  as  news.  The  catastrophic,  namely,  crime,  accidents,  family  rows,
personal  clashes  and  conflicts,  are the most obvious  forms  of breaches of continuity  ...  they

for  people  to  deliberate  well  about  important  questions  and
evaluate purely national practices. 9
It may be too expensive  for candidates  to reach the electorate  via
television.  The  result may  be excessive  competition  to  accumu-
late funds  simply in  order to  have access  to  television;  this com-
petition may have corrosive  effects on the  electoral  process. Free
air time  would be  a possible  response,  perhaps  qualified  by  an
obligation,  on the part  of the candidate,  to  speak for at least fifty
percent of the time or to refrain from negative campaigning.
10.  There  may  be too  little substantive  diversity  of view-too  little
debate  among people  with genuinely  different perspectives  about
issues  of policy  and fact.  Here  too, the result may be  an insuffi-
ciently  informed citizenry.'

11.  The problem  may be not homogeneity  but heterogeneity,  which
may result in a highly balkanized viewing  public, in which many
or  most  people  lack  shared  viewing  experiences,  or  in  which
people  view programming  that largely  reinforces  their own con-
victions and prejudices I  The  result can  be extremism  and  frag-
mentation.62
To  be  sure,  some  of  these  problems  cannot  be  corrected  through
regulation that is either  feasible  or constitutional.  Moreover,  these various
conceptions  of the relevant problem  point toward  diverse  solutions,  some
of  which  would  raise  serious  First  Amendment  problems,  as  discussed
below.63 A particular challenge  is to  develop  approaches  that would  allow a
high degree  of flexibility,  minimize  government  involvement  in program-
ming content,  and also do some good.

regulation grows  weaker  every day;65  it has  even been urged  that  the FCC
no longer has  any  appropriate role.'  Once the problem of scarcity  has been
eliminated,  individual  consumers  can  design  their own  preferred  commu-
nications  package,  at least if the  government  permits  them  to  do so.  Con-
sider  this  utopian  picture  of  a  system  of  unrestricted  markets  in
communications:

There  will  be  room  enough  for  every  sight  and  sound,  every
thought  and  expression  that  any  human  mind  will  ever  wish  to
convey.  It  will  be  a  place  where  young  minds  can  wander  in
adventurous,  irresponsible,  ungenteel  ways.  It  will  contain  not
innocence  but  a sort  of native  gaiety,  a buoyant,  carefree  feeling,
filled with  confidence  in  the  future  and an  unquenchable  sense  of
freedom  and opportunity.
A  conceptual  point  first:  though  many  people  claim  to  argue  for
"deregulation,"  that route is  not in fact an  option,  or at least  not a reason-
able one. What "deregulation"  really means is  a shift from  the status  quo to
a system of different  but emphatically  legal  regulation, more  specifically
one  of property,  tort,  and  contract rights,  in which  government  does  not
impose  specific  public  interest  obligations  but instead  sets  up  initial end-
tlements  and  then permits  trades  among  owners  and producers.  This is  a
regulatory  system  as  much  as  any  other. If it seems  close  to  the  current
system for newspapers  and magazines,  it is  no less  a regulatory  system for
that reason;  a  great  deal  of law  (inevitably)  governs  the  rights  and  duties
of  newspapers  and  magazines.  Such  law  imposes  rights  and  duties,

65.  As  noted  below,  the  rationale  has  not  disappeared;  well  over  one-third  of  American
households  continue  to  depend on  free,  over-the-air  broadcasting.  See U.S.  BUREAU  OF THE  CENSUS,
STATISTICAL  ABSTRACT  OF  THE  UNITED  STATES:  1998  at  573  (118th  ed.  1998)  (Table  No.  915,
Utilization of Selected  Media:  1970  to  1996).  On  some of the  difficulties with  the whole  notion  of
scarcity,  see  R.H.  Coase,  The  Federal Communications Commission, 2J.L. &  ECON.  1 (1959).  The
defect of Coase's  analysis is  his  (remarkable)  lack of self-consciousness  about the idea  that  consumer
sovereignty is  the appropriate ideal  for broadcasting;  it is  as if that  idea is  so self-evidently  correct that
it need not even  be defended.

I  do not deal  here  with the  question  why broadcasters  and  newspapers  should  be subject to
different legal  regimes.  As a matter of fact, the difference  seems  to be a historical  accident,  associated
with the particular form of regulation  chosen  for broadcasting.  See id. at 4-9. As a  matter  of principle,
the  difference has  been justified as a way  of ensuring  two  competing  regulatory  regimes,  each well-
designed  to  combat the vices  associated with the  other. See generally BOLLINGER,  supra note 7. In my
view,  this justification  is  serious  but not convincing,  and some measures  designed  to promote  a  well-
functioning  democratic  culture  might  well  be justified  as  applied  to  newspapers  too.  See CASS  R.
SUNSTEIN,  DEMOCRACY  AND  THE PROBLEM  OF FREE SPEECH  107-08  (1993).  For example,  it would not
be unconstitutional,  in  my  view, for government  to  require  large  metropolitan  newspapers  to  have  a
"letters  to the  editor" page,  or to  require such newspapers  to  disclose their public  service  activities,  or
to require  such newspapers to  publish, on a nondiscriminatory  basis, paid  political advertising.  For the

permissions  and prohibitions;  among other things, it ensures,  via the law of
property,  that some  people,  and not others,  will have access  to the public
sphere. The  issue  is thus  not whether  to  "deregulate,"  but whether  one or
another regulatory  system is better than imaginable  alternatives.

Notice  that  this  is  a purely  conceptual  claim;  it  is  not a  normative
argument  of any kind.  Any market  system necessarily  depends  on regula-
tory controls,  in the  form of an assignment  (by law)  of property  rights and
(legal) rules  of contract. 9  A system of television  is hard to imagine without
ownership  rights; in the absence  of ownership rights,  who could use whose
spectrum  for what purpose? It is  no answer  to  point to voluntary  arrange-
ments.  Such  arrangements  are  likely  to  break  down without  rules  of law
allowing  some  people  to  exclude  others.  If the  Columbia  Broadcasting
System  does not have  a legal right to own spectrum  and to  enter into bind-
ing  agreements  with  others,  it will  not be  able to  provide television  as we
know  it. This point  should be a  familiar one for  land  and other "tangible"
property;  it is no less  true for the  services  provided by television. Indeed,  it
holds,  though to  a lesser extent, for those  who have web  sites and provide
services  over the  Internet;  without legal protection against  trespasses,  and
without  a  right  to  enter  into  legally  enforceable  agreements,  web  sites
would be  a  modern  version  of the  state  of nature-a  battleground  rather
than a framework for productive  relationships. 0

I therefore  turn to the  general question whether  there remains  any rea-
son for government  to regulate  television in the  "public interest."  My  con-
cern  here is both theoretical  and empirical. The  question is  whether, in the
current market, broadcasters  are  likely to provide  viewers what they would
like to  see, and if so, whether that point is decisive  on the question whether
public interest obligations  should be imposed.71  The brief answer is that the
idea  that  broadcasters  show  "what  viewers  want"  is  a  quite  inadequate
response  to  the argument  for public  interest obligations.72  The  discussion

most part,  however,  such requirements  do  not seem  necessary.  But I  cannot  discuss  these  issues  in
detail  here.
69. 

In  certain  circumstances,  norms  may  successfully  do  the  work  of law.  See  ROBERT  C.
ELLICKSON,  ORDER WIrHotrr LAw 4-6  (1991).  But even in  such circumstances,  legal  rules of property
and contract generally  loom in the background.

form of genuine  anarchy,  unregulated  by legal  rules, with norms  and self-help  (in the  form of code)
doing the work  ordinarily  done by  the  law of contract  and property.  Interestingly, the  Internet is  not
subject  to  the  usual  legal  realist  claim  that  private  ordering  is  dependent  on  law  and  that law  is
inevitable.  See CAss R. Su1.sTEIN,  THE PARTIAL  CONSTITUTION  51-54  (1993).  But  it is  very  hard  to
imagine this  state of affairs  for television,  and those  most critical  of the  existing legal  structure  seek
only to replace one legal regime with another. See HUBER,  supra note 27, at 5-30.

here  deals  with the technological  present  and the  short-term  future;  later I
introduce  complications  from emerging technological  developments.

A. 

Three Market Failures

According  to  the economic  model,  a well-functioning  television  mar-
ket  would promote  the  ideal  of consumer  sovereignty.  On  this  view,  the
point of markets  is to  satisfy  consumer preferences.  In this  system, people
would satisfy  their "preferences,"  as these are measured via  the criterion of
private  willingness to  pay. People  would be  able to  choose from a range  of
options,  and  suppliers  would cater  to their tastes.  To a considerable  extent,
of course,  the  existing  system  already  approaches  this  ideal,  and  this  is
increasingly the  case. But there are three serious  problems, each suggesting
that the  economic  ideal  of consumer  sovereignty  is  not  in fact  served  by
free  markets  in programming.  These  are  market  failures  if it is  assumed
that the  purpose  of a  well-functioning  television  market  is  to  ensure  that
programming  is  well-matched  to  viewer  preferences.  In  the  next  Part,  I
question the market  ideal itself.

1.  Eyeballs as the Commodity

The  first point  is the  simplest.  Currently  television  is not an  ordinary
product,  for broadcasters  do not  sell programming  to  viewers  in return  for
cash.  A  system of  "pay-per-view"  would  indeed  fit  the  usual  commodity
model;  but "pay-per-view"  continues  to  be  a relatively  rare  practice.  The
difference between  the  existing broadcasting  market  and  "pay-per-view"  is
quite important.  The key  problem here  is  that  viewers  do not pay a price,
market  or otherwise,  for  television.  As  C. Edwin  Baker has  shown,  it is
more  accurate  to  say  that  viewers  are  a  commodity,  or  a  product,  that
broadcasters  deliver to the people who actually pay them:  advertisers.73

This phenomenon  introduces  some  serious  distortions,  at least if we
understand  an ideal  broadcasting  market  as  one in which  viewers  receive
what they want.  From the  standpoint  of consumer  sovereignty,  the  role  of
advertisers  creates  market  failures.  Of course  broadcasters  seek,  other
things  being  equal,  to  deliver  more  rather  than  fewer  viewers  because
advertisers  seek,  other things  being  equal,  more rather than fewer viewers.
But  advertisers  have  issues  and agendas  of their own,  and the  interests  of
advertisers  can push broadcasters  in,  or away from, directions  that viewers,
or substantial  numbers of them, would like.

This is  a substantial difference from  the ordinary  marketplace.  Adver-
tisers  like  certain  demographic  groups  and  dislike  others,  even when  the
numbers  are  equal;  they pay  extra  amounts  in order  to  attract  groups  that
are  likely to  purchase  the  relevant products,  and this affects  programming

73.

TELEVISION AND  THE PUBLIC INTEREST

content.74 Advertisers  do  not want programming that draws  product safety
into  question,  particularly  if it concerns  their  own products  and sometimes
even more generally.75  In addition,  advertisers  want programming  that will
put  viewers  in  a  receptive  purchasing  mood,  and  hence  not  be  too
"depressing."76  Advertisers  also  tend to  dislike  programming  that is highly
controversial  or that is too  serious,  and hence  avoid  sponsoring shows  that
take  stands  on public issues.'  In these ways,  the fact that broadcasters  are
delivering  viewers  to  advertisers-this  is  largely  their  charge,  under
existing  arrangements--can  produce  offerings  that  diverge  considerably
from what would emerge if viewers  were paying directly  for programming.
To  this  extent  the notion  of consumer  sovereignty  is  seriously  compro-
mised whenever programming  decisions  are a product of advertiser wishes.

2.  Informational Cascades and Broadcaster Homogeneity

A second  problem is that it is  not clear whether  broadcasters  are  now
engaged,  in  anything  like  a  systematic  or  scientific  way,  in  catering  to
public  tastes. At first  glance it would seem obvious  that broadcasters  must
be  engaged  in  this  endeavor  (subject  to  the  qualification  just  stated,
involving the role  of advertisers);  if broadcasters  are  maximizing  anything,
they  must  be maximizing  viewers  (subject  to  the  same  qualification).  In
general,  attracting viewers  is their job7  But there is reason to  question this
judgment,  at  least  in its  simplest  form.  Sometimes  rational  people make
decisions  not on the basis of a full  inspection of the alternatives,  but on the
basis of an understanding  of what other people  are doing.79  Because  people
obtain information  from other  people's  actions,  individual  actions  carry
with  them one  or more  "informational  externalities,"  which  potentially
affect the decisions  of others. Thus,  rational  and boundedly  rational people,
in  business  as  elsewhere,  rely  on  the  signals  provided  by  the words  and
deeds  of others.'0  This reliance can produce cascade effects,  as B follows  A,
and  C follows  B  and A,  and D, as  a  rational  agent,  follows  the collected
wisdom  embodied  in the  actions  of A,  B,  and  C. Informational  cascades
often produce unfortunate  outcomes,  in fact outcomes  far worse than those
that  would  result  if individuals  accumulated  information  on  their  own.
Sometimes, moreover,  people  use the "availability"  heuristic,  deeming  an
event more probable  if an instance of its occurrence  can be readily brought

to  mind.8  Using  the availability  heuristic,  broadcasters  might reason  that if
one  show  or  another  has  attracted  substantial  viewers  in  the  past,  they
should  copy  it.  The  result  would  be  "fads"  and  "fashions"  in  program-
ruing.

82

In theory,  then,  broadcasters  might  be building  on  the  programming
judgments  of  other  broadcasters,  often,  perhaps,  reacting  to  the
"availability"  of salient recent instances in which a particular program  was
especially  popular  (dealing,  let  us  suppose,  with  the  Clinton-Lewinsky
scandal  or the  O.J.  Simpson  trial)  or especially  unpopular  (dealing,  let  us
suppose,  with  South Africa). If this is  true, private decisions  by broadcast-
ers  may produce both mistakes  and homogeneity-mistakes,  in the form  of
programming  that is  not what viewers want,  and homogeneity,  in  the form
of the  "blind leading the blind."83

Recent  evidence  suggests  that  this  theoretical  account  has  consider-
able truth.  A careful  study  shows  that there  is a good deal  of simple imita-
tion,  as  networks  provide  a  certain  kind  of  programming  simply  by
imitating  whatever  other  networks  are  doing  Recently  popular  shows
tend  to create cascade  effects.  This imitative behavior  is  not in the interest
of viewers.  On  the contrary,  it creates  a kind of homogeneity  and  uniform-
ity  in  the broadcasting  market,  and  thus  makes  for problems  in  terms  of
providing  what viewers  "want."'  This is  not a conventional market failure,
but  it suggests  that  existing  decisions  are  unlikely  to  promote  consumer
sovereignty.  The problem  is rapidly diminishing  with  an  increase in  avail-
able  programming  options,  but to  the  extent  that  substantial  numbers  of
people  continue to depend  on a small  number of broadcasters,  the existence
of informational  cascades  suggests  that the  market  does  not entirely  pro-
mote consumer sovereignty.

3.  Externalities and Collective Action Problems

Even  if broadcasters  did provide  each  viewer  with  what he  or she
wanted,  a  significant problem would  remain,  and from the  economic  point
of  view,  this  is probably  the  most  serious  of all.  Information  is  a public
good,  and once  one person  knows  something  (about, for  example,  product
hazards,  asthma, official  misconduct,  poverty,  welfare reform,  or abuse  of

power),  the  benefits  of  that knowledge  will probably  accrue  to  others. 6
Note in this regard  Amartya  Sen's  remarkable  observation that  no famine
has ever  occurred  in a  democratic  country  with a free  press. 87 This  obser-
vation is  complemented by a series  of less dramatic  ones,  showing the  sub-
stantial benefits  for individual citizens  of a media that is  willing and able to
devote  attention  to public  concerns,  including  the plight of the disadvan-
taged.88  Individual  choices  by  individual viewers  are highly  likely  to  pro-
duce  too  little  public  interest  programming  in  light  of the  fact  that  the
benefits  of viewing  such programming  are not fully "internalized"  by indi-
vidual viewers.  Thus,  individually  rational  decisions  may  inflict  costs  on
others  at the  same  time that they  fail  to  confer  benefits  on  others.  In this
respect, the problem "is  not that people  choose unwisely  as individuals,  but
that the collective  consequences  of their choices  often turn out to be very
different from what they desire or anticipate." 9

Most  generally, there  are multiple external  effects  in the broadcasting
area;  some  of these  are  positive, but unlikely  to  be  generated  sufficiently
by  individual  choices,  while  others  are  negative,  and  likely to  be  exces-
sively  produced by  individual  choices.  Consider  a  decision to  watch  vio-

interactions.  Many  of the  resulting  problems  are  connected  with  demo-
cratic ideals.  A culture  in which each  person  sees a high degree  of serious
programming  may well  lead to  better political judgments;  greater  knowl-
edge  on the part of one person  often leads  to more knowledge  on the part
of others  with whom  she  interacts.9'  Perhaps  most  important,  a degree  of
serious  attention to  public issues  can lead to improved governance  through
deterring  abuses  and  encouraging  governmental  response  to glaring  prob-
lems.  In  these  various  ways,  public  interest  programming  can  produce
social  benefits  that  will  not  be  adequately  captured  by  the  individual
choices  of individual  citizens;  the same  is  true  for programming  that pro-
duces  social costs,  including  apathy,  fear, and increased  criminal  activity.'
Because  of  the  collective  action  problem,  an  unregulated  market  will
underproduce  public  goods and overproduce  public bads.

B.  Problems on Nonmarket Criteria: Children, Deliberative
Democracy, and Related Issues

Thus  far  the  discussion  has  emphasized  difficulties  with  television
markets  on  conventional  economic  grounds;  but  it  is  wrong  to  endorse
purely  market approaches  to  television.9 3 Television  is  not best understood
as  an  ordinary  commodity,  subject  to  the forces  of  supply  and  demand.
There  are  several  reasons  why  this  is  so.  The  unifying  theme  is  that  the
American  political  tradition  is  committed  to  the  ideal  of  deliberative
democracy,'  an  ideal  that has  animated  much  First  Amendment  doctrine
and media  regulation  in  general."  Even  if  the  media  market  were  well-
functioning  from the  economic  point  of view,  there  would  be  room  for
measures  designed  to  promote  a  well-functioning  system  of democratic
deliberation, especially  in view  of the  importance  of television  to  people's
judgments  about what issues  are important  and  about what  it is reasonable
to  think.96  Consider,  by  way of general  orientation,  John  Dewey's  sugges-
tion:

[W]hat  is  more significant  is  that  counting  of heads  compels  prior
recourse  to  methods  of  discussion,  consultation  and  persuasion,
while the  essence  of appeal  to  force  is  to  cut  short  resort  to  such
methods.  Majority  rule, just  as  majority  rule,  is  as  foolish  as  its
critics  charge  it  with  being.  But  it  never  is  merely  majority
rule....  The important  consideration  is  that  opportunity  be  given
that  idea  to  spread  and  to  become  the  possession  of  the
multitude....  The  essential  need,  in  other  words,  is  the
improvement  of the methods  and  conditions  of debate,  discussion
and persuasion. That  is the problem  of the public.'

1.  Children and the Hearing Impaired

A  well-functioning  market  may  fail  to  serve  certain  categories  of
viewers.  Of these the most obvious  is  children,  who may be  poorly  served
by  an  absence  of educational programming"  or adversely  affected  by vio-
lent  programming.9  It  is  reasonable  to  treat  the  resulting  problems  as
"externalities,"  but the  more natural  conclusion  is that  the television  mar-
ket is  creating difficulties  even in the  absence  of a market failure. Because
television  has a significant role  as an  educational  instrument, the failure  to

TELEVISION AND  THE PUBLIC INTEREST

serve  children is a significant problem,"  for children lack much ability and
much willingness to  pay, and the  result can be inadequate  attention  to their
needs.101 To be  sure, some children  do have willingness to  pay in the sense
that they  can pressure  their parents  to purchase  certain programming  and
the products  that support it. But it is implausible  to say  that market criteria
exhaust the  goals  of a system of broadcasting  with respect to  the interests
of children.

A well-functioning  market may also  disserve people  who are hearing
impaired,  if they are  deprived  of access  to  television  by the  existing use of
technology.  This  is  a particular  problem  if they  are  unable  to  watch the
news  or  to  understand  descriptions  of  emergency  conditions.  Here  too
there is potential  room for a regulatory  response, partly in order to  include
the  hearing  impaired  in  civic  activities  by  informing  them  of  electoral
issues  and  news  in  general.  To  be  sure,  some  people  who  are  hearing
impaired  are  willing  to  pay  for  closed  captioning.  But  such  people  face
serious  collective  action problems  in making  their needs  and  wishes clear
to  advertisers  and producers.  In any case,  there is  an important  democratic
interest  in  ensuring  that  certain  programming  is  available  to  the hearing
impaired,  quite  apart  from  their willingness  to  pay.  There  is  thus  strong
reason  to  support  communications  policies  that  promote  the  enfranchise-
ment of people with  disabilities.

2.  Balkanization

Imagine  that in  a technological  future,  each  person could  devise  her
own preferred  communications  "menu";  imagine, in other words,  that pro-
gramming  could be fully, and not just partially,  individuated. On  economic
grounds,  this would seem to be a striking  advance,  a guarantee  of a kind of
optimality,  a  victory  for both  freedom  and  welfare.  But from  the  demo-
cratic  standpoint,  it  is  the stuff  of science  fiction,  and  it contains  serious
risks, above  all because  it may  well result in a  situation in which many  or
most are not exposed to  diverse  views, but instead  hear louder  and louder
echoes  of their own preexisting  convictions."l  One  of the  advantages  of a
well-functioning  system of freedom of expression  is  that it supplies  one  or
more  genuinely  public  spheres,  in which  diverse  points  of view are  pre-
sented  and confront  one  another,  and  are  exposed  to  people  who  have  a
willingness  to  learn. General-interest  newspapers  and magazines  often  do
precisely  this,  and it is important to  make  provision for multiple forums of

this kind. Insofar as  they disregard this point, market  conceptions  of com-
munications  miss a central matter.1 3

3.  Citizens, Consumers, and Precommitment Strategies

The most important point is that a market  system may fail  to provide  a
system of communication  that is  well-adapted to  a democratic  social order.
People  are  quite  aware  of  this  fact,  whatever  they  may  choose  in  their
capacity  as viewers  and listeners;  and they may, and often  do,  seek collec-
tive  corrections.  The problem  with  the economic  approach  is that it makes
private  preferences  normative,  or decisive, for purposes  of policy.

In  short, there is  a pervasive  difference  between  what people  want  in
their capacity  as viewers  (or "consumers  of broadcasting")  and  what they
want  in  their  capacity  as  citizens.""Â°  Both  preferences  and  values  are  a
function of the  setting  in  which people find themselves;  they  are emphati-
cally  a product of social role. Â°5  In these circumstances,  it would  be  wrong
to  think  that  the  choices  of individual  viewers  are  definitive,  or  defini-
tional, with respect to the question of what individuals  really prefer.  On the
contrary,  a  democratic  public,  engaged  in deliberation  about  the  world  of
telecommunications,  may  legitimately  seek regulations  embodying  aspira-
tions that diverge  from their consumption choices.

Participants  in  politics  may  be  attempting  to  promote  their  meta-
preferences,  or their preferences  about their own preferences.  They  may be
attempting to  carry out  a precommitment  strategy  of some kind.  They  may
be more altruistic  or other-regarding  in their capacity  as citizens,  perhaps
because  of the nature  of the goods involved.  They may be more optimistic
about the  prospects for change when acting collectively,  and  therefore  able
to  solve  a collective  action problem  faced in their  individual  capacities."6
In this  last respect,  the  democratic  argument  for  departing  from  private
consumption  choices  converges  with the  argument  emphasizing  the  char-
acter of information  as a public good.

When participants  in  a democracy  attempt  to  make  things better  and
do not simply track their consumption  choices, it is not helpful  to disparage

See LEss1G,  supra note  66,  at  185-86.  See  also  JORGEN  HABERMAS,  BETWEEN  FACTS  AND

NoRms  362 (1996),  emphasizing  that

[t]he diffusion  of information and points  of view  via  effective broadcasting  media is not  the
only  thing  that  matters  in  public  processes  of  communication,  nor  it  is  the  most
important....  Mhe rules of a shared practice  of communication  are of greater significance
for structuring  public  opinion.  Agreement  on issues  and  contributions  develops only  as  the
result of more or  less exhaustive  controversy  in  which proposals,  information,  and reasons
can be  more or less rationally dealt  with.

their efforts as  "paternalism" or as "meddling."  Their efforts  at reform rep-
resent  democracy  in action."Â°e  It is  entirely  appropriate  for  government  to
respond  to  people's  aspirations  and commitments  as  expressed in the  pub-
lic realm.  This is especially  so  when  a democratic  polity is itself attempting
to ensure more in the way of democratic deliberation.

4.  Endogenous Preferences

On the  market  view,  freedom  consists  in the  satisfaction  of viewer
preferences,  whatever their content. But this is  an inadequate conception  of
freedom.' Â°  It is  important  to  ensure a  degree  of freedom  in the formation
of preferences,  and not only  in preference  satisfaction.  If people's  prefer-
ences  are formed  as a result of the existing  arrangement,  including limita-
tions  in  available  opportunities,  or  of  exposure  to  a  limited  kind  of
television,  then  it makes no  sense  to  say  that the existing  arrangement  can
be justified by reference  to their preferences.

It seems  clear that the  public's "tastes,"  with respect  to television  pro-
gramming,  do  not  come  from  nature  or from  the  sky.  They  are  partly  a
product  of  current  and  recent  practices  by  broadcasters  and  other  pro-
grammers. They are often  generated by the market."Â°  What people want, in
short, is partly  a product of what they are accustomed  to  seeing.  It is  also  a
product  of existing  social  norms,  which  can  change  over time,  and  which
are  themselves  responsive  to  existing commercial  fare. Tastes  are formed,
not just served, by broadcasters.

This point raises  doubts  about the idea that government policy  should
simply  take  viewers'  tastes  as  given.  In  an  era in which  broadcasters  are
providing  a good deal of public interest  programming,  dealing with serious
issues  in a serious  way, many  members  of the public  will  cultivate  a taste
for that kind of programming.  This effect would promote democratic ideals
by  disseminating  information  and helping to  increase  deliberation."  In an
era in which broadcasters  are  carrying  sensationalistic  or violent material,
members  of the  public  may  well  cultivate  a taste  for more  of the  same.
"Free  marketeers  have little to  cheer  about if all they can  claim  is that the

culture  affects  preferences,  so also do markets  influence  culture."''  If this
is  so,  the ideal  of  consumer  sovereignty  is  placed  under  some  pressure;
market  activities  cannot  easily be justified by  reference  to tastes  that they
themselves  generate.

This  point should  not be overstated.  Probably  broadcasters  have lim-
ited power to push tastes very  dramatically  in one direction  or another. But
at a minimum,  the  idea that viewers'  tastes  are endogenous  to existing  fare
should be taken  as a cautionary  note about  treating consumption  choices  as
decisive  for purposes  of policy.  There is  nothing illegitimate about policies
that depart from consumption  choices  in favor of widely  held  social  aspi-
rations. But there is reason  for broader concern  about the  adverse effects  of
certain kinds  of programming-including  a failure  to  cover  serious  issues
in a serious  way--on democratic judgments.'

5.  Paternalism? Elitism?

It might be tempting  to respond  that the  arguments  thus  far are  unac-
ceptably  paternalistic,  indeed  elitist.  If individual  listeners  and  viewers
prefer fare  of  a certain  kind, how  can  there  be any  grou'd for  legitimate
complaint?  Perhaps  children  pose  a  special  case,  but even  here  parental
guidance is  far from unusual.  Why  should government displace  the  choices
of adults, including parents,  and substitute choices  of its own?

Let us  take  the  charge  of paternalism  first. Notice  that insofar  as the
argument  stresses a collective  action  problem faced by individual  consum-
ers,  paternalism  is  not  at work  at  all. Notice  too  that insofar  as  the  argu-
ment  centers  on  people's  desires  in  their  capacity  as  citizens,  no
paternalism is  involved;  the claim  is  that (a  majority of)  the  people seek  to
push consumption  patterns  in certain  directions.  This form  of precommit-
ment strategy,  or autopaternalism,  should not be confused  with paternalism
of  any  objectionable  kind." 3  To  be  sure,  this  argument  depends  on  an
empirical  proposition  to  the effect  that in their  capacity  as citizens,  people
would  like a communications  market  of a  certain kind." 4 But the  proposi-
tion seems  at the very least highly plausible.

To  the extent  that I have emphasized  the endogeneity  of preferences,
my  argument might  seem to  verge  on objectionable  paternalism.  Certainly
preferences  are not being taken  as given. But there is  nothing objectionable
about  insisting that in a democracy,  free and  equal  citizens  are entitled  to  a
public culture  that will  promote their freedom  and  their  equality.  It  is  one
thing to  say  that a government  should not be authorized  to  overcome  peo-
ple's judgments,  when  those people  are  armed  with  adequate  information.
It  is  quite  another  to  say  that  government  should  be permitted  to  take
modest,  viewpoint-neutral  steps  to  promote the  operation  of a democratic
order by, for example,  ensuring  free  air time  for candidates,  or subsidizing

certain  kinds  of fare,  or promoting  substantive  discussion  of substantive
questions.  And the charge,  indeed  the very  notion, of paternalism becomes
harder  to  understand  when  the  preferences  involved  are  a product  of the
very system whose legitimacy  is at issue.

Nor  is  there  anything  unacceptably  "elitist"  about a communications
policy  that fosters education  of children,  and more substantive  and diverse
coverage  of civic  issues.  To  the extent  that  substantive  programming  is
said to have  special  appeal  for  "elites"  (a vague  and empirically  uncertain
claim), the problem lies not in a policy  that encourages  such programming,
but in unjust background  conditions,  and  in particular, in unjust inequali-
ties  in education. A  communications policy  that attempts  to promote more
discussion  and understanding  of public  issues  is  a partial  way of overcom-
ing those unjust inequalities. It is not a way  of catering to  them.

To  be  sure,  the  charge  of  elitism would  have  force  if programming
content were  dictated  by  a political elite, promoting  its own preferred  fare
free  from  effective  electoral  control.  It is  crucial  to the  argument  offered
here  that  regulatory  strategies-from  the  FCC  or  from  Congress-are
subject to  democratic  supervision.  It is  also  crucial  that any  effort to pro-
mote programming  of a certain kind is  defended,  not by  the preferences  of
the regulators,  but by  democratic values  that should,  at least in  principle,
meet  with widespread  public  approval.  The judgment  on behalf  of delib-
erative democracy  (and corresponding  regulatory  strategies)  does  not itself
come from the sky. Any  view  on its behalf  depends,  not on a claim  that it
is extracultural,  but on the arguments that are made on its behalf.

There  is  no  argument  here  for  any  particular  conception  of public
interest broadcasting.  A  talk-show  on  racial  violence  may  well be  at least
as  desirable,  for democratic  purposes,  as  a  public  debate  between  candi-
dates for public  office. Staged and self-serving  statements  by politicians  on
C-Span may not add more,  and may add less,  to  public understanding  than
(easily  imaginable)  rock  or rap  music  videos.  The  point  of a  system  of
public  service  broadcasting  would  be  to  encourage  those  who  produce
television programming  to use their own creativity to  promote deliberation
about public issues, not to force programming  into any particular mode.

Of  course  public  interest  programming  will do  little good  if people
simply  change  the  channel.  No  one  urges  that  the  government  should
require  people  to  watch  governmentally  preferred  programming.  The  only
suggestion  is  that if the  government,  responsive  as  it is  to  citizen  aspira-
tions,  seeks  to  ensure  more public  interest  programming  than  the market
does,  there  is  no  principled  ground for  complaint. In  any  case  it is  likely
that some  people  would watch  the  resulting  programming  and  develop  a
taste for it; that empirical probability is  all that is necessary  to vindicate the
suggestions made  here.

6.  Constitutional Notes

This is  not  an  Article about  the  First Amendment  or about  constitu-
tional  law;  but it will  be  useful  to  conclude  this  Section  with  some brief
notations  on those  subjects.  From what has been  said thus far, it should be
clear that  a central  purpose  of the First  Amendment  is  to  ensure  a  well-
functioning  democratic  order."5  A system  of free expression  is  designed  in
large  part  to  protect  the  preconditions  for a  form  of sovereignty  that  is
suited  to  genuine  self-governance.  It is  not designed  to  protect  whatever
happens  to  come  out of the  mouths,  or pens,  or word-processors  of those
who are  attempting to  speak. This view  receives  support on both historical
and philosophical  grounds."1 6

One implication is  that government  may well be  permitted to regulate
speakers  who  are  not contributing  to  democratic  deliberation-for  exam-
ple, those who advertise  cigarettes.  Another implication is  that government
efforts  to  promote  a  well-functioning  democratic  order  should  not  be
invalidated  even  if they involve  content  regulation,  so  long  as there  is  no
discrimination  against  any point  of view. If government  seeks  to  ensure  a
certain  level of educational  programming,  or if it allows  free  air time  for
candidates,  or if it provides  a right of access  for those who attempt  to speak
on political  issues,  it is  not violating  the  free  speech  guarantee  merely  by
virtue  of the  fact that  it is  intruding  on  the discretion  of  those  who  own
stations. A  conclusion  to  the contrary  would  convert the  First Amendment
into  a  form  of  Herbert  Spencer's  Social  Statics,"7  or  at  least  Richard
Epstein's  Simple Rules for A  Complex  World; 8  it  would  tear  the  First
Amendment from its theoretical  underpinnings." 9

On  this  view  of the  First  Amendment,  there  is  no  tension  between
constitutionalism  and  democracy,  or  between  individual  rights  and
majority  rule,  properly  understood;  robust  rights  of free  expression  are  a
precondition for both democracy  and majority rule, properly understood.  In
this  way,  private  autonomy  is  in  no  tension  with,  but is  on  the  contrary
inextricably  intertwined  with,  the  notion  of popular  sovereignty.'  The
point is  not limited  to  freedom  of speech.  Protection  of private property,
for example,  can  be  seen  as  a  precondition  of  the  status  of citizenship;
those  whose  holdings  depend  on  the  beneficent  exercise  of government

discretion  are hardly in  a position  to  operate  as independent citizens  in  the
public domain.  And  the protection  against unreasonable  searches  and  sei-
zures,  and other  abuses  of authority  by  the  police,  are  safeguards  of indi-
vidual  liberty that  simultaneously  prevent  attacks  on popular  sovereignty.
The  account  offered  here  thus  provides  a  basis  for understanding  many
individual rights in a way  that fuses  the "freedom  of the ancients"  and the
"freedom of the moderns."'12

PRINCIPLE,  POLICY,  TECHNOLOGY

These  points  suggest that there is  good reason,  in principle,  for some
kind of regulatory  response  to  existing  markets  in television. But  nothing
said thus far argues  for any  particular governmental  initiative.  There  is no
simple  "match"  between  the  identifiable  market  and  nonmarket  failures
and  public  interest  requirements  in  general.  For  example,  it  is  hard  to
imagine  a legitimate  governmental  response  to  the problem  of excessive
homogeneity  on the major networks.  We have  also  seen that existing pub-
lic interest  obligations  are extremely varied;  each of them must be assessed
on its  own.

At  first glance,  policies  that attempt  to  promote  better programming
for children  are most  securely  supported  by  the arguments  made  thus  far
(as  a response  to  what is  reasonably  classified  as a market failure,  and  also
as  a  way  of  increasing  positive  externalities  and  of  promoting
social  aspirations).  Efforts to  ensure that hearing  impaired  people  are able
to  enjoy  television,  through  closed  captioning,  are justifiable  on  similar
grounds.  There is  room also  for efforts  to  ensure  better coverage  of elec-
toral campaigns-perhaps  through  a requirement  of free  air time  for candi-
dates,  perhaps  through  a  private  "code"  designed  to  ensure  more
substantive  discussion.  Disclosure  requirements,  allowing  the  public  to
have a general  sense  of broadcaster performance,  seem to  be justified  as a
nonintrusive  method for allowing  civic  aspirations  to help influence  future
programming.  As  a response  to  the possibly unfortunate  effects  of adver-
tiser pressures,  and also  as a way  of ensuring  against a destructive "race  to
the bottom" with respect to  programming  content, a general code  of broad-
caster behavior  seems  appealing."

A.  Practice

There  are important pragmatic  questions  here. To  say  that a response
is justified in principle  is  not at all  to  say  that it will  succeed  in practice.

[Vol.  88:499

has  produced  unintended  adverse  consequences,123  many  problems  have
emerged  with command-and-control  regulation  of the kind that has  typified
FCC regulation  for most of its history.  Consider,  for example,  the  fairness
doctrine,  designed  to  ensure exposure  to public  issues  and  to allow  diverse
voices to  have access  to  the  airwaves.  A  serious  problem with  the  fairness
doctrine  is  that it appears to  have discouraged  stations  from  covering con-
troversial  issues  at  all,  thus  ensuring  a kind  of bland uniformity  that  dis-
serves  democratic  goals. 24  A  uniform  set  of mandates  may  also produce
waste  and poor programming;  if a network  is especially  bad  at generating
good  shows  for children  and  has  a hard  time  attracting  a  children's  audi-
ence,  is  it  so  clear  that  that  network  should  be  faced  with  the  same
obligations  as  everyone  else?  In  view  of the  great  diversity  of the  broad-
casting  market, a "one-size-fits-all"  approach  may be  far  more costly,  and
less effective,  than creative alternatives.

It is  useful to distinguish  here between  approaches  that suppress mar-
kets  and  approaches  that  supplement  markets."u  Market-suppressing
approaches  include  minimum wage  and maximum hour  laws,  or price  and
wage controls.  Market-supplementing  approaches  include job-training  pro-
grams  and the  earned income  tax credit. In telecommunications  policy,  the
fairness  doctrine  was  a  market-suppressing  remedy;  so  too  are  require-
ments  that  broadcasters  provide  three  hours  of educational  programming
per week,  or a certain  amount of time for candidates  for public  office. By
contrast, the grant of public  funds to the Public Broadcasting  System (PBS)
is a market-supplementing  approach;  so  too is a subsidy  granted  to each  of
the networks,  designed  to  ensure  a certain  amount  of public interest  pro-
gramming.  To  be  sure,  the  line between  the  two  approaches  can  be  thin
when the market-supplementing  approach  ends  up displacing  material  that
would  otherwise  be  supplied  in  accordance  with  forces  of  supply  and
demand.

B.  Communications Past, Present, and Future: Planned
Obsolescence and Beyond

The  arguments  offered  thus  far  have  not  specifically  addressed  the
new  market  in  communications.  An  especially  important  question  is
whether  emerging  changes  in television technology  should  strengthen  sat-
isfaction  with market outcomes.

TELEVISION  AND  THE PUBLIC INTEREST

1.  Predicting the Future

Of course the most striking  feature of the emerging  communications
market is  a  dramatic  increase in the  number of available  stations  and pro-
gramming  options.  The existing regulatory  regime was  designed for  a sys-
tem  with  three  private  broadcasting  networks  and  PBS.  In  1996,  about
thirty-five  percent  of people  who  had television  remained  dependent  on
broadcasters,  which results  in access  to  five  or six  stations.126  This means
that about two-thirds  of viewers had  access  to  between fifty  and  one hun-
dred  stations,  including  the  all-news  stations  C-SPAN  and  CNN,  and  a
range  of  "soft  news"  stations  such  as  MSNBC.  By  itself  this  is  an
extremely  significant  change,  and the  shift  from  this  situation  to  one  in
which  most people  have  access  to  (say)  500  stations  may  be  only one  of
degree.

More dramatic innovations  are coming  in the  future, with  the possible
ultimate  "convergence"  of  various  television  sources,  including  digital
television  and the Internet.'27  If a  "television  set"  becomes  akin  to a  com-
puter  monitor  that provides  access  to  the  full range  of American  maga-
zines,  would  not  the  case  for public  interest  regulation  be  substantially
weakened?  The foregoing discussion  offers an ambivalent  answer.  Some of
the problems  with the market  status quo  would dissipate,  but others  would
remain. Let us explore  these questions in more detail.

For purposes  of analysis,  we might separate  the market for  television
into  four  rough  stages.  The  first  is  the  period  between  the  1940s  and
1970s-the market for which the  existing regulatory system was designed;
call this  the  old regime.  As noted,  the  old regime included  three large  net-
works  and  also  PBS;  the  four  stations  provided  all  of what  Americans
knew  as  television.  The  second  market  is  one  of the  1990s;  call  this  the
transitional  state.  Here  the most dramatic  change is in the number of avail-
able  options.  This  is  a  system  in  which  a  substantial  percentage  (about
thirty-five  percent)  of the  viewing  public  relies  on  five  broadcasters  and
PBS,  but in which sixty-five percent  of the  public has access  to  cable tele-
vision,  and  thus  is  able  to  choose  among  fifty  or more  options."  Of that
sixty-five percent,  a growing  segment  is able  to  see well  over  one hundred
stations. But  in the transitional  state,  broadcasters. continue  to  have  a spe-
cial  role, both because  a substantial number  of people do not have access to
cable  at all,  and because  even cable  viewers watch  the major networks  dis-
proportionately.

The  third stage,  likely  to begin  shortly,  is  continuous  with the transi-
tional  state;  call  this the  stage of multiple options.  This  will be a market in
which  broadcasters  will  continue  to  be  seen  by  more  people  than  other

providers,  but they  will  become  decreasingly  distinctive  in  terms  of both
the  size  and  the  nature  of  their  audience.  Even  more  people  will  have
access  to  cable  or  other  options,  and  many  of those  who  rely  on  broad-
casting  will be  able  to  have more  options  too.  But  broadcasters  will  con-
tinue  to be  seen by  a disproportionate  number of people,  if only because  a
shrinking  but still substantial  percentage  of viewers  will  continue  to  have
access  only to  broadcasters;  this  significant  subgroup  is  important  partly
because  of its sheer  size  and partly because  it includes  an especially  high
percentage  of people,  including  children,  who  are  poor  and  poorly  edu-
cated.  In this stage,  broadcasters  will  in  some ways  be akin  to Newsweek,
Time,  and  U.S. News  & World Report, in  the  sense  that they  will  have  a
relatively  dominant role  in terms  of sheer  numbers.  But  they  will have  to
compete  with  other  programmers,  some  general,  some  specialized,  with
analogues  (most of them now  in place  on  cable  or even  the  Internet)  to
Sports Illustrated, The Economist, Dog Fancy, National Review, National
Geographic, The  New Republic,  Consumer Reports, Playboy, and  many
more.  This  third  stage  will  be  marked  by  the  rise  of  digital  television,
which  is  allowing  broadcasters  to  "multiplex,"  that  is,  to  provide  two,
three,  four,  or even  five  programs  where  they  could previously  provide
only  one.  The  result  may  be to  make  broadcasters  themselves  more  spe-
cialized.129 It is hard  to  speculate  about the future, but the  best prediction  is
that a situation of this kind will prevail  for the next decade and more.

The  final  stage-call  it one  of technological  convergence-is  one  of
substantial  or possibly  even  complete  shrinkage  in  the distinctive  role  of
broadcasters. 30  This will be  a  stage  in which  television programming  can
be provided  via the Internet,  over  telephone  lines,  or both;  a television,  or
one kind of television, may  itself be a simple computer monitor, connected
to  various programming  sources from which viewers may make selections.
If it is  economically  feasible  for broadcasters  to  continue  as such,  they are
unlikely  to  have  a special  role  and  will be  among  a large  number  of pro-
viders.  At most, and extending the analogy  to Time or Newsweek,  they will
have  a  somewhat  larger  and  more  general  audience  than  most  of  their
competitors;  perhaps  they  will  be  entertainment  conglomerates  with
multiple  stations and programs. Perhaps  they will not be distinctive at all.'
The  most extreme  version  of this final  stage would  be akin to  the  market
for books, in which people  make individual choices,  usually not filtered by

an intermediary  offering packages.1

TELEVISION AND  THE PUBLIC INTEREST

2.  Regulatory Options and Technological Change

All  of the arguments  offered  thus  far-about  market and  nonmarket
failures-make  sense  for the  old regime  and  the  transitional  state.  They
also  seem to make  sense  for  the emerging  third  stage  of multiple options;
recall  that even  here,  a  substantial  segment  of the public  will  depend  on
broadcasters  only,  and people  with  access  to cable  and  other  alternatives
continue,  statistically  speaking,  to  watch  a  disproportionate  amount  of
broadcast fare. But arguments  for public interest  obligations  would be less
sensible  as  applied  to  a market  in  which  broadcasters  occupy  no  special
role, partly  because  some  of the relevant problems  would be diminished,
partly because in such  a market it seems  peculiar to  impose  on broadcast-
ers,  and no one  else, a special  duty to  protect public interest  goals. In that
market, perhaps  every  station  should be  faced  with  some  of the  require-
ments  discussed below  (in particular,  the disclosure requirement).  But the
case  for other requirements  (such  as uniform mandates, a broadcaster-only
code, or "play or pay") would be greatly weakened, not least  since it would
seem arbitrary to  single out broadcasters  for such requirements.

Let us  examine,  in more detail,  the force  of the  particular  arguments
as  the market changes  over time.  Even if informational  influences produce
a  degree  of  homogeneity  among  broadcasters,  and  even  if broadcasters
tend to  follow  one  another, the  increasing  number of channels  means  that
for most Americans,  there is  far more heterogeneity  now  than there  was a
decade ago,  and a great deal more heterogeneity  is likely in the near future,
probably  dramatically  increasing  heterogeneity.  At the  same  time,  adver-
tisers  are  likely  to have  an  increasingly  weak role  in  determining  overall
programming  content.  When  a  few  broadcasters  exhaust  the  market,
advertiser  preferences  could have  a more substantial  effect than  they  now
do. Thus,  two of the arguments  made above-involving  the market failures
resulting  from advertiser  pressures  and  informational  cascades-are  sig-
nificantly  weakened.133

But some  of the arguments  offered  above-especially  those  focused
on  democratic  ideals-retain  considerable  force.  Even  in  the  very  long
term,  there  will  continue  to  be  substantial  external  benefits  from
public  interest  programming,  benefits  that  are  not  adequately  captured
by  individual  viewer  choices.  And  to  the  extent  that  citizens  seek  to
push  communications  policy  toward  (for  example)  more  and  better
programming  for children,  or free  air time for candidates,  or greater  access
for  the  hearing  impaired,  changes  in  the  evolving  market  offer  only
partial  answers.  Heterogeneity  may  be  an  inadequate  solution  here.  It

133.  Of  course  these  changes  should  not  be  overstated.  Recall  that  32  percent  of American
households with televisions still  lack cable television,  and that a  substantial number  of Americans  are
likely  to  depend  on  over-the-air programming  for  the  not-too-distant  future;  hence,  the  increasing
heterogeneity  is not quite as dramatic as it might seem.

is reasonable  for citizens to believe  that there  should be very general public
exposure to  public issues,  and that it is  not sufficient  to have  one,  or  two,
or three,  or even more  stations  (CNN,  C-SPAN,  MSNBC)  that  take  such
issues  seriously.  Indeed,  citizens  may  favor  a kind  of general  precommit-
ment strategy-operating  against their  own particular  viewing  choices-
through  which  broadcasters,  at  least,  are required  to  devote  some  time to
educational  or civic programming.  Thus,  the  presence  of news-only  sta-
tions,  especially  on cable,  is  not a  sufficient  response  to  those  who  want
broadcasters  to  do more  and better.  It is  insufficient  partly  because  a sig-
nificant  segment of the  population  will have  no access  to  cable  at all,  and
partly  because  in  their capacity  as  citizens,  people  may  favor  a precom-
mitment strategy that favors  certain public  interest goals.

In the very  long run,  this argument too will be weakened. As  we have
seen, the  strongest  objection  would  come when  broadcasters  are no longer
genuinely  distinctive;  when  this  is  the  case,  it  will  seem  arbitrary  to
encourage  broadcasters,  but not  others,  to  provide  certain  kinds  of pro-
gramming.  In the  face  of such  changes,  it will indeed  make sense  to  adapt
the  proposals discussed  below to  this dramatically  altered market.  But it is
hard  to  explore  this  question  in  the  abstract;  everything  turns  on the  par-
ticular regulatory  proposal that is  at issue.

The question  of adaptation  will arise  at several points below. For now
let us  observe  only that  in  the extreme  situation-when  broadcasters  are
not in any  sense distinctive-the  case  for regulation limited to  broadcasting
would be very weak, and alternative  strategies,  involving funding of public
interest  programming,  would  be better.  Thus,  my  emphasis  here-on  dis-
closure,  economic  incentives,  and  voluntary  self-regulation-is  designed
for  a (likely not inconsiderable)  period  in  which broadcasters  continue  to
occupy  a special role. To  simplify a complex story,  the very long-term  may
call  for a  combination  of public  subsidies  for high-quality  programming
and disclosure requirements  for general-interest  stations. But in  the shorter
term, there is  a great deal  more  to  consider. And it is  important to  see  that
in the long-term  much  may be  lost,  as  well  as  gained,  with  a  highly  bal-
kanized  communications  system in which many  people  are  not exposed  to
serious programming,  many others  simply hear echoes  of their own voices,
and widely  shared viewing experiences  become rarer."

There  is  a large issue  in the  background  here:  how to  define  the mar-
ket from which to  assess proposals  for public interest  requirements.  Tradi-
tionally,  "television  broadcasting"  has  been  viewed  as  the  relevant
category,  but skeptics might well ask why  the real  category is  not "sources
of information  and entertainment."  If that category  were  the relevant  one,
there might  seem  to  be no problem  calling for requirements  at all-not  in
the  1930s, not in the  1950s,  not in the  1970s,  not in  the  1990s,  and  not  in

TELEVISION AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST

the foreseeable  future. The traditional approach  seems best  defended  on the
ground  that television  has  a  special  role  and  salience;  if this  is  no longer
true,  a particular  regulatory  regime,  limited to  television,  loses  its ration-
ale.'35 The best argument for the future  is that even if television  as a whole
is  far from the  only  source  of information  and entertainment,  it continues
to have a distinctive  social role, and efforts to promote the goals associated
with public interest programming might do considerable  good.

IV
DISCLOSURE

Consider  a  simple proposal:  broadcasters  should  be required  to dis-
close, in some detail and on a quarterly basis,  all of their public service  and
public  interest  activities.  The  disclosure  might include  an  accounting  of
any  free  air time provided  to candidates,  educational  programming,  chari-
table  activities,  programming  designed  for  traditionally  under-served
communities,  closed  captioning  for the hearing  impaired,  local program-
ming,  and public service  announcements." 6 The  hope,  vindicated by expe-
rience with similar  approaches  in  environmental  law, 37  is  that a disclosure
requirement  will by  itself trigger improved performance, by creating  a kind
of competition  to  do better,  and by  enlisting various  social pressures  in the
direction  of improved  performance.  A  requirement  of this  sort would  be
part  of a general  trend  in federal  regulation,  one with  considerable  prom-
ise.138

A.  Precursors

Many  statutes  and regulations  now require  the  disclosure  of informa-
tion.  Some of these are  designed  to  assist consumers  in making  informed
choices;  such statutes  are  meant to  be market-enhancing.  By  contrast,  oth-
ers  are  designed  to  trigger  political  rather  than  market  safeguards;  such
statutes  are  meant  to  enhance  democratic  processes.  The  most  famous
of  these  is  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA). 139  Enacted
in  1972,  the  principal  goal of NEPA  is to require  the government  to  com-
pile  and disclose  environmentally-related  information  before  the govern-
ment  goes  forward  with  any  projects  having  a  major  effect  on  the

environment.1"  NEPA  does  not require  the  government  to  give  environ-
mental effects  any particular weight, nor is  there judicial review  of the sub-
stance of agency  decisions.141  The  purpose  of disclosure  is  principally  to
trigger political safeguards,  coming  from the  government's  own judgments
or from external  pressure.  Governmental  indifference  to  adverse  environ-
mental  effects  is  perfectly  acceptable  under  NEPA:  the  idea behind  the
statute  is  that if the public is  not indifferent,  the  government  will  have to
give some weight to environmental  effects.

Probably  the most successful  experiment  in information  disclosure  is
the  Emergency Planning  and Community  Right-to-Know  Act (EPCRA). 142
Under this statute,  firms and individuals  must report to  state and local  gov-
ernment  the  quantities  of potentially  hazardous  chemicals  that have  been
stored  or released  into  the  environment.  On  the  basis  of  the  relevant
results,  the  EPA  publishes  pollution  data  about the  releases  of  over  300
chemicals  from over  20,000 facilities."  This has been an exceptional  suc-
cess  story,  one  that has  well  exceeded  expectations  at the  time of  enact-
ment.14  A  detailed  report  suggests  that  EPCRA  has  had  important
beneficial  effects,  spurring  innovative,  cost-effective  programs  from  the
EPA and from state and local  government.146

Many  other statutes  involving health,  safety,  and the  environment fall
into the  category  of information  disclosure  measures.  The Animal  Welfare
Act 47 is  designed partly to ensure  publicity about  the treatment  of animals;
thus covered  research facilities  and dealers  are required  to  file reports  with
the government  about their conduct,  with  the apparent  goal that the reports
will  deter  noncompliance  and  also  allow  continuing  monitoring.' 
In
addition  to  its  various  command-and-control  provisions,  the  Clean  Air
Act 149  requires  companies  to create  and  disclose  "risk management  plans"
involving  accidental releases  of chemicals;  the plans must include a worst-
case  scenario."  The  Safe Drinking  Water  Act"'  was  amended  in  1996 to

TELEVISION  AND  THE PUBLIC INTEREST

require  annual  "consumer  confidence  reports"  to  be  developed  and  dis-
seminated  by  community  water  suppliers.1 52 Statutes  governing  discrimi-
nation  and  medical  care  also  seem  committed  partly  to  the  idea  that
"sunlight  is  the best of disinfectants"; 53  thus  they  require  covered  institu-
tions to  compile reports  about their conduct and compliance  with applica-
ble  law.  The  Federal  Election  Campaign  Act"M  requires  political
committees  to disclose a great deal  of information  about their activities.

Of  course  there  is  an  overlap  between  informational  regulation
designed to assist consumers  and informational regulation designed to trig-
ger political checks. A  statute that requires  companies to  place "eco-labels"
on their products  may produce  little in the way  of consumer response,  but
shareholders  and  participants  in  the  democratic  process  may  attempt  to
sanction those  companies  whose  labels  reveal environmentally  destructive
behavior.  Companies  will know  this  in  advance,  with  likely  behavioral
consequences.  The  risk  of  sanctions  from  shareholders  and  state
legislatures  may  well  produce  environmental  improvement  even  without
regulation.

A great  deal of recent  attention has been given to informational regu-
lation  in  the  particular  context  of  the  communications  industry.  As  an
alternative  to  direct  regulation,  which  raises  especially  severe  First
Amendment  problems,  the government  might attempt to increase  informa-
tion instead. Thus,  the mandatory  "v-chip"  is intended to  permit parents  to
block programming  that they want to  exclude from their homes;  the v-chip
is  supposed  to  work  hand-in-hand  with  a  ratings  system. 155  Similarly,  a
provision  of the  1996  Telecommunications  Act requires  television  manu-
facturers  to  include  technology  capable  of  reading  a  program  rating
mechanism;  requires  the FCC to create  a ratings methodology  if the  indus-
try  does  not produce  an acceptable  ratings plan within  a year; and requires
that broadcasters  include  a rating  in their signals  if the  relevant program is
rated. 5 6 Spurred  by this  statute,  the networks  have  generated  a  system for
television ratings,  which is now in place. 157  The  question is whether  disclo-
sure requirements  might be enlisted more  generally.

B.  Rationale

Why  has  information  disclosure  become  such  a popular  regulatory
tool? There  are several answers.  For various reasons,  a market failure  may

come  in  the  form  of  an  inadequate  supply  of  information. 5 '  Because
information  is  generally'59  a  public  good-something  that  if provided  to
one is  also provided  to  all or many-workers  and consumers  may  attempt
to  free  ride  on the  efforts  of others,  with the result that too  little informa-
tion is provided. For this reason,  compulsory  disclosure  of information  can
provide  the  simplest  and most direct  response  to  the relevant  market fail-
ure.

Information  disclosure is  often  a far less expensive  and  more efficient
strategy  than  command-and-control,  which  consists  of  rigid  mandates
about  regulatory  ends  (a  certain  percentage  reduction  in  sulfur  dioxide
emissions,  for example),  regulatory  means  (a  technological  mandate,  for
example,  for  cars),  or  both."6  A  chief  advantage  of  informational
regulation  is  its comparative  flexibility.  If consumers  are  informed  of the
salt  and  sugar content  of foods,  they  can proceed as  they wish,  trading  off
various  product  characteristics  however  they  see  fit.  If workers  are  given
information  about the risks posed by their workplace,  they can trade safety
against  other possible variables  (such as salary,  investments  for children or
retirement,  and leisure). 6'  If viewers  know  the  content  of television  pro-
grams  in advance,  they  can use  market methods  (by  refusing  to  watch)  or
political  methods (by  complaining  to stations)  to induce changes.  From the
standpoint  of efficiency,  information  remedies  can  be  better  than  either
command-and-control  regulation or reliance on markets  alone.

From  the democratic  point of view,  informational  regulation  also has
substantial  advantages.  A  well-functioning  system of deliberative  democ-
racy requires  a certain  degree  of information  so  that citizens  can engage in
their  monitoring  and  deliberative  tasks.  Subject  as  they  are  to  parochial
pressures,  segments  of the government  may have insufficient  incentives  to
disclose  information  on  their  own;  consider  the  Freedom  of Information
Act  (FOIA) 62  or the Federal Election  Campaign  Act  (FECA), 163  designed
to  counteract the  self-interest  of government  or private  groups, which may
press  in the direction  of too little disclosure.  A good way to  enable citizens
to  oversee  private  or  public  action,  and  also  to  assess  the  need  for  less,
more,  or different  regulation,  is to  inform  them of both private and  public

See ANTHONY  OGUS,  REGULATION:  LEGAL FORM  AND  ECONOMIC  THEORY  121-25  (1994).

158. 
159.  Of  course  it  is  possible  to  give  information  more  "private  good"  characteristics,  and
innovative approaches  can be  expected  in  the next  decade.  Consider,  for example,  fees for  access  to
information  on  the Internet,  or the  subscription-based  Consumer Reports; neither of these  approaches
converts information  into  a private  good, but both reduce  the range of people  who may, without  high
cost,  have access  to it. It is  possible to  imagine a range of approaches  that  would  diminish  the cost of
access for some while increasing  it, or holding it constant, for others.

activity.  The  very  fact  that the  public  will be  in  a  position  to  engage  in
general monitoring  may well be a spur to  desirable outcomes.

EPCRA is  the  most obvious example  here.  Sharp,  cost-effective,  and
largely  unanticipated  reductions  in toxic releases  have come  about without
anything in the way of direct regulation."6  One of the causes  appears  to be
adverse  effects  on  stock prices  from repeated  disclosure  of high levels  of
toxic releases.' 
In the area of broadcasting,  it is possible  to  hope that  dis-
closure  of public  interest  programming,  and the mere  need to  compile  the
information  each  year,  can  increase  educational  and  public  affairs  pro-
gramming  without involving government  mandates  at all. A primary  virtue
of informational regulation  is that it triggers political safeguards  and allows
citizens  a  continuing  oversight  role,  one that  is,  in the  best cases,  largely
self-enforcing.

None of this is to  say  that informational  regulation  is  always effective
or  desirable.  Under  imaginable  assumptions,  such  regulation  would  be
much  less  effective  than command-and-control  regulation  and  much more
expensive  than  reliance  on  markets  unaccompanied  by  disclosure
requirements.  Sometimes  informational  strategies  cost  more  than they  are
worth,  and  may be  ineffectual  or even counterproductive.  Whether  these
are  convincing  objections  depends  on  the incentives  faced by  those  who
disclose,  and  these  incentives  are  likely  to  differ  with  context.  Undoubt-
edly,  the most successful  cases  of disclosure  involve well-organized  groups
able to  impose reputational  and financial  harm  on those  engaged in  harm-
ful  activity."

C.  The Minimal Proposal

We  are now in a position  to  discuss  a disclosure requirement  for pub-
lic  interest  programming  in  somewhat more  detail.  On a  quarterly  basis,
every broadcaster  should be required to  make public  the full range  of pub-
lic  interest  and public  service activities  in which it has engaged.  The rele-
vant  activities  might  involve  free  air  time  for  candidates,  educational
programming,  public  service  announcements,  access  for  disabled viewers
(as  through  closed  captioning  or video  descriptions),  charitable  activities,
emergency  warnings  and  services,  and  the like.  The  FCC  should  require
completion  of  a  relatively  simple  form  to  ensure  accurate  and  uniform
accounting,  and FCC staff should sanction those stations that have failed to
disclose,  or that have done so inaccurately.

A special  advantage  of disclosure requirements  is that they  appear to
fit well  with  the  emerging  communications  market  insofar  as they  allow
maximum  flexibility  and  do not impose requirements  that may be rapidly

outrun  by changing  technologies.  Even in  a period  in which  broadcasters
are  akin  to  Time  and Newsweek,  such  requirements  would  make  a  good
deal  of  sense  as  a  means  of  creating  some  democratic  pressure  for
improvement.67  Of course  it  is  reasonable  to  think  that,  as  the  market
evolves,  disclosure requirements  should be placed  on all programmers,  and
not be  limited  to  broadcasters.  The  hope-based  on  good  results  in  the
environmental  context-would  be  that such requirements  would  produce  a
kind of "race,"  at least in  some markets,  to do more and better.

D.  Of Realism and Ineffectiveness

Is the  hope realistic?  People did  not anticipate  that the  Toxic  Release
Inventory  (TRI)65  would by  itself spur behavioral  changes;  the question  is
whether  the  same  forces  might  operate  here.  The  answer  depends  on
whether  the mechanisms  that have produced  significant  voluntary  changes
in the  environmental  arena will also be triggered  in this setting.

In order  for voluntary  improvements  to  occur,  the  disclosure require-
ments must be accompanied  by political activity  or existing norms  that will
increase  public  interest  programming.  With  respect  to  the  TRI,  well-
organized  groups  have  been able  to  threaten,  or to use, publicity  so  as  to
induce  companies  to  undertake  voluntary  reductions.  Environmental
groups  have  mobilized  when  disclosure  shows  high  levels  of toxic  emis-
sions;  anticipating  this,  companies  have reduced  emissions  voluntarily.'69
Thus,  the  effect  of the  TRI has been  to  draw  private and  perhaps  govern-
mental  attention  to  the  most  serious  polluters,  who  have  an  incentive  to
reduce  on their own.  Once  this process is  underway,  there has been  a kind
of competition  to  produce  further reductions,  as  each  polluter seeks  to  be
substantially  below the group of most serious polluters.

The  question  is  whether  the  same  might  happen  here.  The  answer
depends  first  on  the  existence  of external  monitoring  and  second  on  the

167.  An  obvious  question  is  whether,  if  the  case  for  disclosure  has  been  made  out,  similar
requirements ought to be  imposed on magazines  and  even newspapers.  Indeed,  the same question might
be  asked about economic incentives  and voluntary self-regulation,  as discussed  below. I do not  discuss
these  questions  here.  For  those  who  believe  that  there  is  increasingly  little  difference  between
television and print  media, it might seem that  if requirements  of this  sort are not desirable  for the latter,
they are  also  undesirable  for the former.  The best response  to  this argument  is in  BOLLINGER,  supra
note 7, at 85, with the suggestion that the different  regulatory regimes  for the broadcast  and print  media
are  well-suited  to  two  different  images  of press  freedom,  one  image  involving  democratic  self-
government, the other involving a form of economic laissez-faire.  Bollinger believes that  the existence
of two parallel  regulatory  regimes  makes  appropriate  space  for each of these  images,  and  that  if one
regulatory regime  goes wrong  (through, for example, excessive regulation of television, or an excessive
"race to  the bottom" in magazines),  the other can serve as a corrective.  See id. at  128-32. This Article is
in  the general  spirit  of Bollinger's  approach,  but  it  attempts  to  develop  more  flexible  tools  for
implementing  it, tools that are better adapted to  the emerging television market.

TELEVISION AND  THE PUBLIC  INTEREST

power  of the  monitors  to  impose reputational  or financial  harm  on broad-
casters  with  poor  records. 10  The  external  monitors  may  include  public
interest  groups  seeking  to  "shame"  badly  performing  broadcasters;  they
may include  rivals who  seek to create a kind  of "race to the  top." From  the
disclosures,  it should  be clear  which  broadcasters  are  doing  least to  pro-
mote the public  interest,  and perhaps  those  broadcasters  will be  specially
targeted  by private  groups  and competitors.  The  ultimate  effect  cannot  be
known  a  priori.  If public  interest  organizations,  and  viewers  who  favor
certain programming,  are  able to  mobilize,  perhaps in concert  with certain
members  of  the  mass  media,  substantial  behavioral  effects  might  be
expected.  It is  even possible  that a disclosure  requirement  would help cre-
ate its own monitors.

These  are  analogies between  environmental  disclosure and disclosure
of public interest activities, but there are important differences  as well. It is
possible  that toxic  releases  are  such  a salient  and easily  quantified public
"bad"  that a political response  is  quite likely;  perhaps  a failure  to provide
public interest programming  is  a far less  salient "bad."  An announcement
that  a certain  company has emitted  a  certain level of toxic pollutants  may
produce  a  rapid  public  outcry  and  considerable  media  attention;  an
announcement  that  a certain  station  has failed  to provide free  air  time for
candidates  may be met with public indifference,  even a yawn. Partly  this is
because  acts  seem  worse than omissions  (whatever the conceptual  difficul-
ties  with making  the distinction).  Partly  this is because  the harmful  effects
of toxic  pollution  seem serious  and  real in the  abstract,  a point  that is  far
less  clear  with  a  particular  station's  refusal  to  provide  programming  for
children.  The harmful effects  of that refusal might be mitigated  by the fact
that  programming  for children  is  available  on  other  stations,  and  indeed
any  problems  caused, or not solved, by profit-seeking  television companies
might  well  be  remedied  by  other  sources  (newspapers,  magazines,  the
Internet).  These  points  suggest that information  disclosure may  well work
better  in the  environmental  context,  in which  the nature  and extent  of the
problem make public concern  far more  likely.

In short,  companies  are responsive  to economic  incentives,  as well as
to  existing  social norms.  Information  disclosure  works  best  when market
pressures,  or political  pressures,  are  likely  to  result  in  significant  costs
for those whose performance  is poor. In the environmental  context, disclo-
sure  strategies  have  worked  well  when  companies  have  feared  their
consequences.7 
In the context  of television,  the risk is  that disclosure will
have no effects  at all-a purely  symbolic measure.  Indeed,  the very  collec-
tive action problems  that argue for public service  obligations raise  the pos-
sibility that an information system will be quite ineffectual.

But  in  view  of the  relative  unintrusiveness  of  a  disclosure  require-
ment, and  the flexibility  of any private  responses, this  approach  is  certainly
worth  trying.  At  worst,  little  will  be  lost.  At  most,  something  will  be
gained,  probably  in the  form  of better  programming  and greater  informa-
tion  about the  actual performance  of the  broadcasting  industry-and  also
about the  circumstances  in which  disclosure requirements  will  be  effective
on their  own. In light of the aspirations  of most viewers,  the possible result
of disclosure  will  be  to  improve  the  quality  and  quantity  of both  educa-
tional  and civic  programming  in  a way  that  promotes  the  goals  of a  well-
functioning  deliberative  democracy.  The most  effective  system  of disclo-
sure  would work in  concert  with  well-organized  advocacy  groups  willing
to publicize  poor performance  and to  bring  general  attention  to  those  who
do both  worst and best.

V
ECONOMIC INCENTIVES

In this Part, I explore the possibility  that broadcasters  might meet their
public interest  responsibilities,  not through  a set  of uniform  requirements,
but through  economic  incentives.  As  we will  see,  the  most  creative  and
promising  approach,  modeled  on recent  environmental  reforms,  involves
"play or pay," in which broadcasters  are given a choice between  complying
with  public  interest  requirements  or paying  someone  else  to  put  public
interest programming  on the air. I begin with  a discussion of "play  or pay,"
and then  move to  a more ambitious  treatment  of the  alternatives,  growing
out of the law of tort, and posing  a debate between  market-suppressing  and
market-supplementing  approaches.

A.  Of Nature and Coase

Ronald Coase's  work on  efficiency,  free  trades,  and  transaction costs
originated  in  the area of communications,  and in particular, in  an  attack on
the  FCC; but it has been most influential  in  the  environmental  arena.' 
In
that area,  there has  been  a great  deal  of dissatisfaction  with rigid  govern-
mental  commands,  and there  has also  been an  unmistakable  movement  in
the direction  of more flexible  economic  instruments,  which  are likely  to be
far more  efficient.'73  A command  might  say, for  example,  that every  coal-
fired power plant must reduce  its  sulfur dioxide  emissions  by fifty percent,
or that  it must  use  technology  of a  governmentally  specified  kind.  With
respect to  environmental  protection,  incentives  typically  come  in  two  dif-
ferent forms:  pollution  fees, imposed  on those who  produce environmental

harm,  and  tradeable pollution  right  or "licenses,"  given to  those who pro-
duce pollution.  Under the pollution  fee model,  the government  might  say
that companies  must pay  a certain amount per unit of sulfur  dioxide  emis-
sion. Under the tradeable  pollution right model, the government  might say
that each company is  permitted to  emit a certain specified  amount of sulfur
dioxide, but that its permission,  or right, can be bought and sold on the free
market. In the  former model,  it pays to reduce  pollution simply in  order to
reduce  the level of the tax.  In the latter model,  it also pays to reduce  pollu-
tion  because  the reduction  can  be used to engage  in more of the  relevant
activity  or in  order to  obtain money  from  another  who  cannot  reduce  so
cheaply.  Fees  or tradeable licenses  should  create good  dynamic  incentives
for  pollution  reduction,  and  also  move  environmental  protection  in  the
direction of greater  cost-effectiveness. 74

There  is a complex literature  on the  choice between pollution fees  and
tradeable  emission  rights. 175  The  solution  depends  largely  on  an  inquiry
into  what the  government knows  and does not know.'76  In general,  a fee is
better  if the  government  is  able  to  calculate  the  damage  done per unit  of
pollution  but has  difficulty  in calculating  the appropriate  aggregate  pollu-
tion level. In those circumstances,  a fee is better because  the  government is
unlikely to  err in setting it, whereas  a system of tradeable  permits will pro-
duce mistakes.  By contrast,  a tradeable  permit  is better if the government
knows  the  appropriate  aggregate  level, but is unable  to  calculate the  dam-
age done per unit of pollution. In either case, the government  can capitalize
on the  informational  advantage  held by private  businesses  participating  in
pollution  control,  so as to  allow them to  decide  on the  most effective,  least
expensive method of achieving  any particular pollution reduction. If, under
a  system  of pollution  fees,  it is  extremely  expensive  for Company  A  to
reduce  its current  level,  it may  choose  to  pay  a  high tax.  If the  system is
one of tradeable  pollution rights, it may simply pay  someone  else, capable
of reducing  pollution  more  cheaply,  to  produce  the  relevant  reduction
instead.  For any  desired  level of reduction,  a  system  of economic  incen-
tives  should produce  the  right result at a lower  cost, by  allocating  burdens
to  those most able to bear them.

B.  Taxes, Public Bads, Hot Potatoes, and Cold Spots

Although the  FCC has experimented  with allocating  communications
rights  via  auction,  little  thought  has  been  given  to  the  possibility  of
using  economic  incentives  to  promote  public  interest  goals  in  the

communications market.  In principle,  however, both the  fees  approach  and
the license  approach  may well be preferable  to  government commands.  At
least this  is  so  if  we  think  of public  interest  programming  as  a  "good,"
which people  should pay for failing  to produce, just as pollution  is a "bad,"
which  people  should pay  for producing.  Consider  educational  program-
ming and  free  time  for  presidential  elections.  Suppose,  for  example,  that
ABC is in  an  especially  good  position  to  produce  high-quality  program-
ming for children,  whereas  CBS  is  in  an  especially  good position  to  pro-
mote  high-quality  programming  involving  presidential  elections.  Rather
than requiring  both  ABC  and  CBS  to  produce  educational  programming
and programming  involving presidential  elections,  the  government  might
allow each to pay a fee, or a tax, if it is to be  relieved of the requirement  of
providing  one  or the other.  This is  the  "tax"  model  of public  interest pro-
gramming.  Alternatively,  the  government  might  adopt  the  tradeable  emis-
sion  right  model,  and  allow  CBS  to  sell  ABC  its  obligation  with
respect  to educational  programming,  while permitting ABC to  sell CBS  its
obligation with respect to presidential  elections.

A  large problem  with  a tax  is that it is  very  hard  to  calculate.  Should
the government use  market measures of some kind,  or attempt to  measure
the public  loss, or lost public gain,  from the  broadcasters'  behavior? Either
approach  would  be  quite  difficult.  In  these  circumstances,  the  simplest
approach  would be  for the  government  to  experiment  with  "play  or pay"
approaches,  in  which  broadcasters  have  a  presumptive  obligation  to  pro-
vide  public  service  programming  but  can  buy  their  way  out  by  paying
someone else  to provide  that programming  instead.  Such approaches  have
had  considerable  success  in the  environmental  area,  despite  a number  of
familiar reservations."7  People have  objected,  for example,  that emissions
trading  will make  an unfortunate  "statement"  about  pollution,  thus  legiti-
mizing  it, 78  or that trading  will  result  in  the  concentration  of pollution  in
dangerous  "hot  spots,1 179  or  that  the  administrative  burdens  of a  trading
system are  overwhelming.'  Practice  has generally  shown  these  objections

a system in  which those  who  do

important  advantage,  because  it is so  much more flexible  than  one in  which

TELEVISION AND  THE PUBLIC INTEREST

system of "play or pay"  seems  to be the  most cost-effective  means of pro-
moting  public  interest  goals, just  as  emissions  trading  is  the most  cost-
effective  means  of reducing  pollution.  For  those who  dislike it,  a public
interest  obligation  can  be  treated  as  a kind  of  "hot  potato";  fortunately,
from their  point of view,  it is  one that they can  transfer to  others,  as a gift
accompanied by cash.

It  is  possible  to  respond,  as  has  been  conventionally  thought,  that
public interest  responsibilities  are  a general part  of the public trust and not
alienable,  and that broadcasters  should not be permitted to "buy their  way"
out  of  those  obligations.  But it  is  unclear  what  content  to  give  to  this
statement;  the question  is  what concrete harm would  be created  by  a right
to  "pay"  rather  than  "play."  If the  "play  or  pay"  option  had  corrosive
effects  on  the  norms  of the broadcasting  industry,  by making  people  take
public responsibilities  less seriously,  that would indeed  be a problem;  but
there  is little reason to  believe  that the  option would have  this effect. The
simple  question is this:  What  if a broadcaster were willing  to give ten mil-
lion  dollars  to  PBS  in return  for  every  minute,  or every  thirty  seconds,  of
relief  from  a  public  interest  responsibility?  At  first  glance,  the  nation
would  be better off as a result, simply because  the result would be to  pro-
vide  the  same  level  of  public  interest  broadcasting  at  lower  cost.  Any
objection to a system of tradeable  rights would have to be more subtle.

A  conceivable  problem with an  economic  incentive  in this context  is
that it may undermine  the general  purpose  of public interest programming
by  producing  a situation in which that programming  is confined  to  a small
subset of stations-"cold  spots"-in a kind of communications  equivalent,
or converse,  of the  "hot  spot"  problem  in  the  environmental  area."8 3  The
"hot spot" problem arises  when trades result in  a concentration of pollution
in a single  area,  with serious  adverse  health  effects;  it is  generally  agreed
that steps must be taken to  ensure that this  does not happen."8  In  the com-
munications  context,  the  problem  will  arise  if  all  of  the  widely  viewed
broadcasters  end  up  selling  their obligations  to  a  single  station  or set of
stations.  This is undesirable if it results  in a kind  of "ghettoization"  of pub-
lic interest  programming  and if it is  believed, as  seems  quite  sensible, that
all or most viewers  ought  to have  access  to  some  public interest program-
ming.

A  second  problem  is  both  conceptual  and  administrative.  When  a
trade  is  made,  what is  being traded?  Perhaps  it seems  simplest,  and most
sensible, to  trade minutes  for minutes. But all broadcast minutes  are not the
same.  An "internal"  trade could  be one in which ABC (for example)  trades
an  hour of prime-time  programming  for  an  hour of  3:00  A.M.  program-
ming;  an  external  trade  could  involve  a  transfer  of  one  hour  of  ABC's

highly popular  evening  hours  to  (say)  FOX's  far  less  popular  show in  the
same  period.  Steps  must be  taken to  ensure  that in  any  trade,  there  is  an
equal  public interest benefit for public  interest  loss. Perhaps  a test  of audi-
ence shares--"viewer-per-viewer"  trades-is the best way to  start.

An  approach  of this  kind  would  have  the  fortunate  consequence  of
helping to  handle the  "cold  spot" problem  as well.  Part of the problem  can
be handled by  monitoring the  sales to  make sure that a high-viewer  broad-
caster  is  trading  to  other high-viewer  stations.  If the  "minute-for-minute"
trades were  adjusted  to take  account  of the number  of viewers,  a trade to  a
low-viewer  station  would  be especially  expensive.  Demographic  consid-
erations  could play  a role  as well.  The  details  are  less  important  than  the
suggestion that a creative  administrative  solution  could reduce  the relevant
problems, just as these have been handled in  the environmental  arena.

C.  Economic Incentives and the Constitution

What  is  the  relationship  between  economic  incentives  and  the  First
Amendment?  A direct tax on undesirable programming,  or on the failure  to
provide  desirable  programming,  would raise  serious  constitutional  ques-
tions. This is  because  the  tax  would be a regulation  of speech  on the  basis
of content.  Whether  such  a regulation  would  be unconstitutional  should
turn on many  of the  questions  raised  in  debates  over the legitimacy  of the
"fairness  doctrine,"  designed to  compel  coverage  of serious  issues  and  an
opportunity  to  speak for opposing  views. 85  Many  people  have argued  that
with decreasing  scarcity, the  fairness  doctrine  is no  longer legitimate,  if it
ever was.'86  If this objection  is  correct,  an  economic  incentive  in  the  form
of a tax would be questionable  too.

This point  raises  the  question why,  if a tax  would  be constitutionally
problematic,  a system of "play or pay,"  which has  similar motivations  and
consequences,  would  not  be  constitutionally  problematic  as  well.  The
intuition  might be that  a tax  is  a  direct penalty  on a  certain programming
content, whereas  "play or pay"  simply  provides  an alternative  ("pay")  to  a
legitimate  mandate.  But this  seems  to  be  a form  of wordplay.  If  a tax  is
questionable,  "play or pay"  should be  questionable  as well.

My  suggestion  here is  that there  should be no  constitutional  objection
to  the  extent that the  government  is acting,  in  a viewpoint-neutral  fashion,
to  promote  educational  goals  and  attention  to  civic  affairs.  Current  law
gives  no  clear  answer  to  that  question."1  For those  who  believe  that  the

government  is prohibited from favoring  programming  of a particular con-
tent, "play  or pay" should  be unacceptable.  The problem  with this view  is
that it  seems  to  convert  the First Amendment  into  a  species  of Herbert
Spencer's  Social Statics,"'8  in a  way  that loosens  the connection  between
the  free  speech  principle  and  underlying  democratic  goals.  If the  First
Amendment  is associated  with democratic  self-government  and with  delib-
erative democracy,  "play  or pay,"  of the sort suggested  here, would  be per-
fectly consistent with the free speech  guarantee.  9

D.  Expanding the Viewscreen: A  Glance at the Cathedral

Thus  far I  have  been  exploring  economic  incentives  by  contrasting
taxes  and tradeable  rights with command-and-control  regulation.  But if we
wanted  a more complete picture,  we would widen the viewscreen  a bit. In a
classic  article,  Guido  Calabresi  and A.  Douglas  Melamed  proposed  four
"rules"  that courts  might adopt  for nuisance  suits."9  Two  of the rules  come
from a  situation in which either  the  plaintiff or the  defendant  is  given the
relevant entitlement,  and it is protected  via a "property rule,"  in which case
the  entitlement  could  be reallocated  only  through  a trade.191  The other two
rules  come  from  a  situation  in  which  either  is  given  an  entitlement  pro-
tected by  a  "liability rule,"  in which  case the  entitlement  could be reallo-
cated through a legally forced  exchange,  at a price  determined  through the
legal system  (assumed  to  be  the  market price)."9  Calabresi  and Melamed
also  discuss  "inalienability  rules,"  in  which  no  exchanges  are  permitted,
either voluntarily or through the legal system. 193

There  is  a great deal  of room for exploring,  through this lens,  the  sys-
tem of public interest  regulation.  If public  interest programming  is  desir-
able,  and if certain programming  is  undesirable,  it makes  sense  to think  of
ways  of requiring  broadcasters  to  pay  "damages"  or instead requiring  the
taxpaying  public  to pay  for better programming.  Valuation,  of course,  is  a
serious  problem.  Suppose  that certain  programming  (educational  or civic,
for example)  is  a  public  good,  producing  positive  externalities,  and  that
certain  programming  (violent  material,  for example)  is  a public  bad, pro-
ducing  negative  externalities.  How can  the  government  assign monetary
values  to  the desirable  and undesirable  effects?  Is  it constitutional  for the
government  to do  so? These  questions are  hard enough  in the  area  of torts;

they are far harder in  the context of broadcasting.  I restrict myself here to a
comparison  of some leading alternatives.

Rule 1.  The government requires all broadcasters to provide public inter-
est programming; no bargaining is allowed.

Comment:  This is  the  traditional  model,  with  the  debate  being  about
its scope;  the number of obligations  was  sharply reduced  in the  1980s,  but
without rethinking  the basic model. Under this system, the public's interest
in the  relevant programming"9  is protected  by an inalienable  property rule.
The entitlement  is granted  to the  government,  and it is entitled to  mandate
broadcaster  performance.  Broadcasters  have  a  kind  of  "split"  property
right; they  own  the right to broadcast  as they  choose  (in  general),  but the
public has  a kind  of lien on  the property,  giving  it ownership  rights  over
certain  areas.  Those  who like  the traditional  approach  appear  to  think that
it has  good  social  consequences,  by,  for  example,  ensuring  that  public
interest programming  is not relegated to unpopular  times  and channels,  and
also  that  it has desirable  "expressive"  effects,  by,  for example,  affirming
the  status  of broadcasters  as  public  trustees.  As  we  have seen,  it also  has
several  problems;  its rigidity  is  likely  to  lead  to  inefficiency,  and it may
well produce  unintended  adverse  consequences,  as  in the  case  of the  fair-
ness doctrine.

Rule 2a.  The government requires broadcasters who do not provide public
interest programming to pay a kind of "damage award" to be determined
by  the government and then used to fiund public interest programming by
others, such as PBS.

Comment:  Under  this  approach,  the  public  continues  to  have  the
relevant  entitlement,  which  is protected  by  an  unusual  liability  rule.  The
broadcasters'  failure  to provide  educational  programming  for children  or
free  air time for candidates  would count as a kind of social harm for which
broadcasters  would  have to  pay. (The same  might be said of the  provision
of  violent  or  sexually  explicit  programming,  though  here  the  First
Amendment  problems  would  be  quite  serious.)  One  problem  with  this
approach  is  the  need to  calculate  the  level of the  "damage  award."  There
are no  clear market measures  for this  amount,  which will  therefore  have  a
level of arbitrariness.

Rule 2b.  The government requires each broadcaster to provide a certain
level of public interest programming, but permits broadcasters to transfer
their obligations (accompanied by  money)  to  others,  at  a  market-
determined rate.

194. 

I am so describing  it for convenience, without  making any normative judgment.

TELEVISION AND  THE PUBLIC INTEREST

Comment:  This is  akin to Rule 2a, in the sense  that the public has  the
relevant entitlement,  which is protected  by  a kind of liability rule, but here
the market, rather  than the legal system, determines  the value of not play-
ing  the public  interest programming.  One  station  might  sell  to another  its
obligation to  provide,  say, one hour of educational  programming;  the sell-
ing  station  would  pay  the  market-determined  amount  to  ensure  that  the
buying station will find it worthwhile  to  take on the new  duty. This kind of
market  determination  could be  a substantial  advantage in  light of limited
information  on the government's  part, as the government is in an extremely
poor position to calculate  any  such "damage award."

As  compared  with  Rule  1, a potential  problem  with this  approach  is
that some  people  may  avoid  the stations  that  "play"  and may  not see  the
relevant  programming  at  all.  On  the  other  hand,  the  empirical  question
remains  whether under  Rule 1 most members  of the viewing  audience  will
see  and benefit from the mandated programming.

Rule 2c.  The  government establishes a minimum  total content of public
interest broadcasting on broadcast networks  each year (for  example, 6
hours of free air time for candidates, 150 hours of educational program-
ming for children); assigns initial obligations to  each broadcaster; and
then permits broadcasters to  trade the obligations at market-determined
prices.

Comment:  This is very  close to  Rule 2b; the only difference  is  that it
is  a  precise analogy  to  certain  initiatives  in environmental  law,  in  which
the  government  establishes  a maximum  level  of pollution  in the relevant
area, provides  pollution permits,  and then  allows trades  among polluters. 15
A disadvantage  of this approach,  as compared to  Rule 2a, is  that it may be
harder  to  calculate  the  total  level  of  appropriate  programming  than  to
decide  on  the  appropriate  tax  for those who  do  not  "play."  On  the other
hand,  the  opposite  may  be  true.'96  An additional  difficulty,  as  discussed
above,  is that broadcasting  hours  are  not fungible.  An  hour of children's
programming  is  much less valuable  at 3:00  A.M. on  Monday  than  at 9:00
A.M. on Saturday.

Rule 3a.  The  government pays broadcasters (at reasonable but govern-
ment-determined rates) to provide public interest programming.

Comment:  Under  this  approach,  the  broadcasters  have  the  relevant
entitlement, which is protected  by a liability rule. The broadcaster  owns the
entitlement,  but the  government  is  permitted  to  obtain  a forced  exchange,

just as it is  in the  general  law  of eminent  domain.  In fact it is  possible  to
see  some  kind  of payment  as  the  constitutionally  compelled  solution,  at
least  if the  right  to  provide  such programming  as broadcasters  choose  is
taken  to  be,  by  constitutional  decree,  an  entitlement  in  broadcasters.  For
example,  the  government might  be  able  to  compel  coverage  of important
issues,  or  attention  to  the  needs  of  children,  or programming  involving
emergencies,  but the public has to pay.

Interestingly,  the  government  appears not to have tried  this approach,
at least not as a general rule. An advantage of this approach  is that it should
not be difficult to  calculate  the  value  of the  exchange;  the  market  will help
answer  that question.  This is  an important  advantage over  Rule 2a.  On the
other hand, Rule  3a has probably  been resisted, as  compared  with  Rules  1,
2a,  and 2b,  with  the thought that because broadcasters  are beneficiaries  of
public  largesse,  they  should  not be paid  to  promote  public  interest  goals.
This  is  of course  a distributional  concern,  and  the  underlying judgment-
that  "broadcasters,"  rather  than  "taxpayers,"  should  pay-is  not  clearly
correct  in light of the  complexity  of the  incidence  of the  burden  imposed
under Rules  1, 2a, or 2b. The  burden under the  latter rules  does  not  simply
fall  on  "broadcasters,"  but more  likely  on  advertisers  and  ultimately  on
consumers-perhaps  to  the  benefit  of those  who  advertise  in  newspapers
and on cable. Rule 3a might be preferable  if it is  amended  as  suggested  in
Rule  5a, which would require broadcasters  to buy spectrum rights.

An  important  difference between  Rule 3a  and Rules 2a,  2b, and  2c  is
that  the  latter  rules  give  the  entitlement  to  the public,  in  a  way  that  may
have  important  psychological  effects  on  any  trades.  The  initial  allocation
of the  entitlement  creates  an  endowment  effect  and  tends  to  "stick,"'" 
in
part  because  of its  legitimating  function.  Those who  favor public interest
obligations  might be skeptical of Rule 3a for this reason alone.

An  additional problem with  this kind of system is  that it may provide
broadcasters  with  an incentive  to  produce less  public  interest  broadcasting
on  their  own  than  they  otherwise  would,  or  at  least  to  understate  the
amount  that  they  would  voluntarily  provide.  In  an  unrestricted  market,
political  and  shareholder  pressures,  conscience,  and  advertiser  and  viewer
demand  will  result  in  a  nontrivial  amount  of  public  interest  program-
ming. 9 '  But if the government  proposes  to  pay  broadcasters  for  whatever
public  interest  programming  they provide,  voluntary  service  may  be  sub-
stantially  reduced.  This is  a pervasive  problem  with  paying  people  to  do
good or not to  do bad; the payment may induce less  of the good or more  of

the  bad.  The  question  for Rule  3  is  whether  it  is possible  to  generate  a
"baseline production  level"  from which any subsidy could be calculated.

Rule 3b.  The government must-and does-buy the right to ensure public
interest programming, at market-determined rates.

Comment:  This is  a variation on 3a in the  sense  that it transforms  the
broadcasters'  entitlement  into one protected  by a property rule. It is akin  to
a  system  of  free  markets  in  broadcasting,  but  with  two  qualifica-
tions:  Broadcasters  are  not required to pay for their  entitlement  in the first
instance,  and government  stands ready  to compete  with others  who seek to
obtain  access  to viewers.  One advantage  of Rule 3b  over 3a is that it oper-
ates  entirely  on the basis  of market-determined  prices;  no  one has  to  cal-
culate  a  special  government  rate.  But if one  believes  that  existing  fare  is
not problematic,  the  government's  purchases  will  be wasteful.  And those
committed  to public interest programming  may object that the government
will not purchase  enough (unless this is specified in  some way in advance);
they  may  also  object  that  so  long  as  licenses  are  being  given  away  free,
other rules, not giving a "windfall"  to broadcasters,  are better.

Rule  4.  Broadcasters provide such public interest broadcasting as they
choose, including none at all.

Comment:  Under this  approach, the broadcasters'  interest is protected
by  a  property  rule.  Broadcasters  own  the  relevant  entitlement.  Just  as
occurs  in  an ordinary  market, people  can pay broadcasters  to provide pub-
lic interest  programming,  at market-determined  prices.  The  problem  with
this approach  is that the market price might be too  high, for all of the rea-
sons  discussed in Part I.B  of this Article.  This  approach  is  similar to Rule
3b,  except  that  the  government  does  not stand  ready  to  ensure  a  certain
level of public interest programming.

Rule 5a.  Broadcasters must buy, via auction, the right to broadcast, and
once they  do  that, they  can provide such public interest broadcasting as
they choose, including none at all.

Comment:  This  is  a  genuine  market  solution.  It  does  not  involve
a  governmental  "giveaway"  of a  scarce  resource,  and  after  the  valuable
commodity  has been purchased,  free  trades  are  allowed.  It seems  to  have
all  the  advantages  of Rule  4, with the  further  advantage  that  the  valuable
property  right  is  purchased  rather  than  simply  conferred.  The  problems
with this  approach  should be easy  to  identify from Part I.B  of this Article.
In short,  the  result may  be insufficient  public interest programming,  partly
because  of  the  endowment  effect,  partly  because  of  collective  action
problems,  partly  because  of the  limitations  of  the  market model  in  the

CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW

[Vol.  88:499

communications  industry,  and partly because  of public aspirations  diverg-
ing from private consumption  choices.

Rule 5b.  Broadcasters must buy, via auction, the right to  broadcast, but
once they  do  that, they  may be  asked or (if for some  reason necessary)
compelled to provide public interest broadcasting at market-determined
prices.

Comment:  This is  quite  similar to  Rule 5a.  The difference  is  that the
government  stands ready  to pay for public interest  programming  on broad-
cast  stations,  at market prices;  and if broadcasters  for some reason  refuse,
the  government  can  force  an  exchange.  Under Rule  5b, part  of the  entitle-
ment is  owned,  but protected  only  by  a liability  rule. This  approach  is  in
one  sense  a cousin  of Rule  2b. The  major  difference  is  that here  the  tax-
payers  are  paying  for public  interest  programming  (at  the  same  time  that
they  receive  money  from  the  sale  of  the  spectrum),  rather  than
"broadcasters."  The  most important  difference  is  therefore  distributional.
As  noted above,  that difference  is  more complex  than it seems  in light of
the  fact that when  a burden is  imposed  on "broadcasters,"  their advertisers
are  likely to  be paying  much  of the  bill,  and  the  result  will  be  complex
effects  on consumers,  on other communications  outlets,  and  on advertising
choices.  There  is  no simple redistribution,  in Rule 2b, from "broadcasters"
to the "public."

Rule 5c.  Broadcasters must buy, via auction, the right to broadcast; once
they  do so, they may be subject to public interest obligations, but they can
pay a "damage award," to be used by some other station to support public
interest programming, if they fail to fulfill their obligations themselves.

Comment:  This  should also  decrease  the  amount paid for  the entitle-
ment,  as compared  with Rule 5a.  This is  a "play or pay"  version  of Rules
5a  and  5b.  The  problem  here  lies  in  determining  the  level  of any  such
"damage  award."  This approach  is  in  one sense  a cousin  of Rule 2a,  as  a
"play  or pay" system.

A  full  understanding  of these  possibilities  would  greatly  facilitate
both  conceptual  and  empirical  inquiry.  Undoubtedly  a choice  among the
various  options  should  depend  partly  on  the  particular  public  interest
obligation  involved;  for  example,  a  requirement  of emergency  warnings
might  take  the  form of Rule  1, whereas  a requirement  of free  air time for
candidates  might be some combination  of Rules  1, 2b, and  5b. The analysis
thus  far  suggests  that  Rules  2b  and  5b  have  special  advantages  over  the
alternatives.  Rule  2b, the basic  "play or pay" system,  seems  well-suited to
the  current  period,  as  a kind  of interim  improvement  over  the  regulatory

2000]

TELEVISION AND  THE PUBLIC INTEREST

status  quo. In some areas,  Rule 5b may well be better in the longer term, as
broadcasters  come  to resemble  general-interest  magazines.  Movement  in
the direction  of  selling  the  spectrum,  rather  than  giving  it away  to  prese-
lected owners, would also be highly  desirable.

E.  A Brief Note on Cultural Policies and Cultural Subsidies

The  immediately preceding  discussion raises obvious questions  about
when and whether it is  appropriate  for the government  to devote  collective
resources  to  the promotion  of a better  cult-are,  and in particular,  to promo-
tion of a better  democratic  order. A  "cultural policy"  might, for example,
involve the use  of taxpayer funds  to promote opera  or high  art, perhaps  by
subsidizing  musicians  and  artists,  perhaps  by  making  it  easier  for  poor
people  and  children  to  afford  to  go,  perhaps  by  creating  a  situation  in
which  people  can  attend  at  vastly  reduced  rates  or  even  for  free.  In
Washington,  D.C.,  for  example,  people  can  attend  public  museums,
including  those  devoted  to  historical  and  democratic  issues,  for  free,  a
practice  that  creates  a  distinctive  atmosphere  for  people  who  visit  the
nation's  capitol.  Such visits  would have a different tone  if, for example, it
were necessary  to  pay three dollars  to attend the National  Archives,  which
house the original  Declaration  of Independence,  Constitution,  and Bill  of
Rights.

The  general  topic of  public  funding  of cultural  endeavors  is  highly
controversial  and  has  received  considerable  attention.1"  The  discussion
thus far  suggests, at  a minimum,  that such policies  should  be less contro-
versial  when  individual  consumption  choices  involve  a collective  action
problem, or when in their  capacity  as citizens, most people  urge their gov-
ernment  to  promote  some  activity  in  order  to  promote  genuinely  public
aspirations.  The  argument  is  most  secure  when  those aspirations  involve
democracy  itself. There is reason  for  the  government  to support program-
ming that promotes public  education  about civic  affairs, whether or not that
programming  is provided  by markets  themselves;  and at a minimum,  gov-
ernment  subsidies  of  this  kind  are  firmly  supported  on  theoretical
grounds.2 Â®

perhaps by a wider range of those who produce  television for the  American
public.  The idea of voluntary self-regulation--of  television  and content  on
the  Internet-has  received  growing  attention  in many  nations."0 '  For many
decades,  in fact,  the  NAB  did indeed  impose  a code,  partly  to  promote its
economic  interest  (by  raising  the price  of advertising),  partly  to  fend off
regulation  (by showing  that  the  industry  was  engaged  in  self-regulation),
and  partly  to  carry  out  the  moral  commitments  of  broadcasters  them-
selves.'  And voluntary  self-regulation has  played a role in  numerous  areas
of media  policy,  including,  for  example,  cigarette  advertising,  children's
advertising,  family  viewing,  advertising  of  hard  liquor,  and  fairness  in
news  reporting.0'  A  code  has  a great  deal of potential.  Above all,  it could
address a far greater number  of problems  than could  an economic incentive
(for First Amendment reasons),  and it appears  to  have far  more potential
for producing good,  and reducing bad,  than a disclosure requirement.

For  example,  a  code  could  address  all  public  interest  obligations
mentioned  thus  far,  but  also  attempt  to  protect  against  sexually  violent
material,  against subliminal  advertising,  against  sensationalistic  treatment
of politics,  and against a wide range  of other problems  with  television.  The
question  is  whether  it  is possible,  in  the  current  era,  for broadcasters  to
overcome  some  of the unfortunate  effects  of the marketplace  with volun-
tary measures.  An underlying question, likely to  be faced  in many  areas of
regulatory  policy both domestically  and internationally,  is  whether  a code
would  work as  a kind  of unfortunate  cartelization  or instead  as protection
against an undesirable  "race to the bottom."

A  code might  do  a  great  deal  of  good,  partly  because  of the  likely
existence  of external monitors,  partly because  of a code's  capacity  to help
develop  a kind of internal  morality  likely to  affect many  of its  signatories.
A general  lesson is that  the antitrust laws  ought not to be  invoked too read-
ily  to  prevent  producers  from  undertaking  cooperative  action  in  circum-
stances  in  which competition  is  producing  palpable  social  harms.  In  such
contexts,  a code  can  provide some  of the  advantages  of government  regu-
lation,  but  do  so  in  a  more  flexible  and  better-informed  fashion.  It  is
hazardous  to invoke  the antitrust laws  to prevent  an  industry from provid-
ing  the  kinds of benefits  that might be provided,  more crudely  and  expen-
sively, by direct regulation.20

TELEVISION AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST

A. 

The Problem and a Recently Emerging Strategy

Notwithstanding  the  qualifications  described  above, competitive  pres-
sures often  can and do provide programming  that people would  like  to  see.
In an era of cable and satellite television,  and an increasingly  large range  of
options,  competitive  pressures  will  be especially  important in  producing
"niche"  programming  for people  who have  a particular interest  in serious
programming.  The  communications  market  increasingly  resembles  the
market for magazines;  recall the possibility,  in a digital market, of over  one
thousand  stations.  But  competitive  pressures  have  a  downside.  They  can
lead to  sensationalistic,  prurient,  or violent programming,  and to  a failure
to provide  sufficient  attention  to  educational  values,  or to  the kind  of pro-
gramming that is indispensable  to  a well-functioning  democracy. Â°s  This is
so  especially  in light of the fact that a small relative  advantage  can lead to
huge  increases  in  viewers,  a  fact  that  presses  television  in  tabloid-like
directions. As Robert Frank and Philip Cook have suggested,

[i]ncreasingly  impoverished  political  debate  is  yet  another  cost of
our current cultural  trajectory.  Complex modem  societies  generate
complex  economic  and social  problems,  and the  task  of choosing
the best course is  difficult under the best of circumstances.  And yet,
as  in-depth  analysis  and  commentary  give  way  to  sound bites  in
which  rival  journalists  and  politicians  mercilessly  ravage  one
another,  we become  an increasingly  ill-informed and  ill-tempered
electorate.2"
It would be possible  to  respond  to  the harmful  effects  of competitive
pressures  in  various  ways.  Probably  the  simplest response  would take  the
form  of voluntary  self-regulation,  through  some  kind  of "code"  of  good
programming;  this  approach  is  specifically  designed  to  respond  to  the
problems  that  can be  introduced  by  market  pressures.  In various  nations,
including  the United  States,  cooperative  action has  played  a constructive
role  in  situations  of this  kind.2"  Though  it  has  yet  to  receive  much  aca-
demic  commentary,2 s voluntary  self-regulation  via industry  agreements  is
emerging  as  a  regulatory  strategy  of  choice,  especially  in  the  environ-
mental  arena?Â°  The  EPA,  for  example,  has  encouraged  companies  that
produce  pesticides  to  agree  on  pesticide  reduction  strategies,  and  here

the fact of broad  agreement  is  crucial."'  California  has attempted  to  deal
with  the  problem  of workplace  accidents  via  a  "cooperative  compliance
program"  involving self-enforced  safety  plans  on  large  construction  proj-
ects.  The  result  has  been  a  significant  drop  in  accident  rates.2"'  Self-
regulating  agreements are now in place in Canada's  system for forest man-
agement;  in the Responsible  Care program  of the  chemical  industry,  now
operating  in  more  than  forty  countries;  and  in  national  regulation  of
nuclear power plants 12

What  accounts  for  the  increasing  popularity  of  industry  self-
regulation,  as part  of the  general  project  of "reinventing  government"?1 3
From the industry's  standpoint,  self-regulation  allows  far more flexibility
than government  mandates.  From  the standpoint  of government,  a special
advantage  of codes  is  that  they  avoid the  kind  of informational  overload
that comes from government prescriptions.214 It is partly for this reason  that
voluntary  agreements  among  companies  have had good  effects  in the  area
of occupational  safety  and health?15 In a point  of special  relevance to  tele-
vision, codes  also have been found to  have the power to influence  commu-
nity  attitudes  in  a  way  that  tends  to  contribute  to  the  development  of  a
custodial  ethic.216  Thus,  codes  have  helped  to  develop  an  institutional
morality  that brings  the behavior  of industry  members  within  a normative
framework.

2 17

Such cooperative  action raises concerns  about antitrust  violations  and
self-interested  profit-seeking  under  a  public-spirited  guise.  This  is  of
course  a risk, but the  antitrust law can go wrong when  it prevents  coopera-
tive  action  that overcomes  palpably  adverse  effects  of market  pressures.
Indeed, the International  Standards  Organization  is  designed specifically  to
ensure  a  form  of  cooperation  to  overcome  those  adverse  effects; 28  the
question is whether  that experience has communications  analogues.

TELEVISION AND  THE PUBLIC INTEREST

My  emphasis  here  is on  allowing  programmers  and journalists  to  do
what,  in  an important  sense,  they  would actually  prefer to  do. It is  worth
underlining  this point. Many journalists in the world of broadcasting  would
very  much like  to  do better;219  competitive  pressures  are  the problem, not
the  solution, and  a voluntary code could help them and the public as well.

B.  A  Code:  Sample Provisions

The  question is  whether  it might be possible  to  adopt a new  code for
broadcasting,  specifically  designed  for the  new  communications  market.
There have been many precursors for voluntary self-regulation  via codes."
A  new  code  might  update  the old  NAB  code,  and help  overcome  current
problems,  without  having  the  degree  of  tepidness  of  the  existing
"standards."  A code  might even promote some of the goals associated with
deliberative democracy.

What  provisions  might a new  code include?  The  appropriate  level of
specificity  is  an  important  concern;  especially  clear  provisions  ("three
hours  of  educational  programming  per  week")  risk  excessive  rigidity,
whereas  vague  provisions  ("reasonable  efforts  to  provide  educational
programming  for children")  risk meaninglessness.  Discussions  of code-
making in general  have stressed  the need for  "the public announcement  of
the  principles  and  practices  that  the  industry  presumptively  accepts  as
a  guide  to  appropriate  conduct  and  also  as  a  basis  for  evaluating  and
criticizing performance."'  This point argues  in favor of a degree of speci-
ficity.

Consider  the  following  possible  code  provisions, 

simply  for  the

sake of illustration:

1.  Each  broadcaster  shall  provide  three  hours  of free  air time  for
candidates  during  the two-month period  preceding  the  election.
In  return for free  air  time, candidates  shall  discuss  substantive

labour,  forced  labour,  health  and  safety,  trade  union  rights,  discrimination,  discipline,
working hours, and pay.... As  the name  SA8000  suggests,  it is the  first to  be modelled  on
existing  and  widely  accepted  commercial  standards  such  as  IS09000,  drawn  up  by  the
International  Standards  Organisation  in  Geneva,  which  is  used  to  determine  whether
companies  have  the  management  systems  to  meet  required  product  quality.  But the  real
strength of the new  approach  is commercial  sanctions. A  company  which adopts  the  code
also agrees  to be  independently  inspected  to see whether  it is  abiding by  the conditions  laid
down. It will be able  to attract customers  and gain a competitive advantage by advertising  the
fact that its  factories and suppliers meet the standard.

222.  These  provisions are adapted but substantially revised  from the more detailed code  suggested
by the  Advisory  Committee's  FINAL  REPORT,  supra note  19. I believe that  the provisions  described
there  are  too  vague  and tepid  to  be  useful  (I can  attest  that this  was  a  quid pro  quo  for Committee
agreement);  for reasons  discussed in the text, vague  and tepid  provisions create  a high probability  of
futility and ineffectiveness.

issues  in  a  substantive  way  and  must provide  something  other
than short "sound bites."

2.  Each  broadcaster  shall  provide  one  hour  of  educational  pro-
gramming  for  children  each  day.  Broadcasters  shall  attempt  to
ensure  that  children  are  not exposed  to  excessively  violent pro-
gramming  or programming  that is  otherwise  harmful  to, or inap-
propriate  for,  children.  Broadcasters  shall  avoid  programming
that  encourages  criminal  or  self-destructive  behavior;  they
should  also be  sensitive  in presenting  sexual  material  that chil-
dren might encounter.

3.  News  coverage  shall  be substantive  and issue-oriented.  It  should
not emphasize  the sensational  and the  prurient. It should concern
itself  with  claims  and  disagreements  on  matters  of  substance.
Consistent with the  exercise  of legitimate  station  discretion,  sta-
tions  should  not give excessive  or undue  attention  to  sensational
accusations,  or to  reports  of "who  is  ahead  in  the  polls,"  at  the
expense of other issues.

4.  Morbid,  sensationalistic,  or  alarming  details  not essential  to  a
factual  report, especially  in connection  with  stories  of crime  or
sex,  should  be  avoided.  News  should  be  broadcast  in  such  a
manner  as  to  avoid  panic  and  unnecessary  alarm.  News  pro-
gramming should attempt  to  avoid prurience,  sensationalism,  and
gossip. Stations  should make  an  effort to  devote  enough  time to
public  issues  to  permit  genuine  understanding  of problems  and
disagreements.

5.  Violence  should be  portrayed responsibly  and  not exploitatively.
Presentation  of violence  should  avoid  the  excessive,  the  gratui-
tous,  the  humiliating,  and the  instructional.  The  use  of violence
for  its  own  sake  and  the  detailed  dwelling  upon  brutality  or
physical  agony,  by  sight or sound, should  be  avoided.  Programs
involving violence should venture to  present the consequences  to
its  victims  and perpetrators.  Particular care  should  be  exercised
where  children  may  see,  or are involved  in,  the  depiction  of vio-
lent behavior. Programs  should  not present rape,  sexual  assault,
or sexual violence in an attractive  or exploitative  light.

6.  Broadcasters  shall  ensure  that their programming  is responsive  to
the  needs  of citizens  with  disabilities.  To  this end,  broadcasters
shall  ensure  that programming  is  accessible,  through  the  provi-
sion  of  closed  captioning  and  other  means,  to  the  extent  that
doing  so  does  not impose  an  undue  burden  on  the  broadcaster.
Particular  efforts  should  be  made to  provide  full access  to  news
and  public  affairs  programming.  Hearing  impaired  citizens  are

sometimes  at  risk  of  a  form  of  disenfranchisement,  or  even
physical  danger, because steps  are not taken to  ensure  that televi-
sion broadcasting  is  available  to  them. Stations  should take spe-
cial  steps  to  ensure  that  information  about  disasters  and
emergencies  is  fully  accessible  to  those  who  are  hearing
impaired,  ideally in "real time."

7.  Broadcasters  shall  cover  international  as well  as  domestic  ques-
tions  and give appropriate  coverage  to  important  events  in other
nations. They  should recognize  that purely  national questions  are
often hard to  evaluate  without an  understanding  of the practices
of others,  and also  that many  questions,  including  those  of war
and  peace,  cannot  be  well-understood  without  the  kind  of
background  that comes  from suitable  attention  to  developments
and events  abroad.

C.  A  Code: Problems and Prospects

Such  a  code would  of course  raise  many  questions.  The  first would
involve the  problem of enforcement.  Without  an enforcement  mechanism,
a  code  might  have  no  effect  at  all,  indeed  it might  be  a  form  of public
deception.'  The  enforcement  question  is  a  central  part  of the  general
inquiry into the preconditions  for effective self-regulation. 4

There  are several  obvious possibilities.  The  simplest would be for the
NAB  to  undertake  enforcement  on  its  own,  just as  it  did  under  the  old
code. It might, for example,  give a seal of approval to  those who are shown
to  comply  with  its provisions  and  deny  a  seal  of approval  to  those  who
have been shown  not to  have complied.  The NAB  might  also  give special
public recognition  to  those  stations that have  compiled an  excellent public
service  record  in the  past year.  Such  recognition  might  be  awarded  for,
among  other things,  meeting the  needs  of children in a  sustained  and crea-
tive  way;  offering  substantive  and extended  coverage  of elections,  includ-
ing  interviews,  free  air  time,  and  debates;  offering  substantive  and
extended  coverage of public issues;  and providing  opportunities  for  discus-
sion  of  problems  facing  the  local  community.  At  the  time  of  license
renewal,  a  notation  might  be  given  to  the  FCC  that  there  has  been
compliance or continuing  or egregious  noncompliance  with the code.  If the
NAB is unwilling  to  enforce  a code  of this kind,225 perhaps  a private group

code).  For  a  helpful  overview  of the  preconditions  for  success,  see  Douglas  C.  Michael,  Federal

In the summer of 1998  and January  1999,  the NAB  decided not to oppose the idea  of a code
publicly  and officially,  but did  suggest "serious concern"  about any government  effort to  interfere with

[Vol. 88:499

could  take the initiative, both promulgating the  code and publicizing it, and
in that  (modest) sense  sanctioning  violations. 6  A  special  problem  here is
that  in  light  of increasing  competition  from  nonbroadcast  programming
sources, a code  would not be in the  economic  interest of broadcasters  even
if  generally  adopted,  and  this  is  an  unpromising  fact  for  a  code's
effectiveness? 7  Perhaps  supplemental  enforcement  will  come  from rivals
of those who  defect from the agreement  and violate the  code;  this is  a  rea-
sonable  prediction  in  theory,  and  something  similar  has  been  found  in
analogous  areas."

Any  enforcement  by  the  NAB  or even  a  private  monitoring  group
would be most likely to  succeed  if accompanied  by  external  pressures  of
one  sort  or another.  As  in  the  case  of  disclosure  requirements,  the  most
promising possibilities  include public interest  groups  able to  mobilize rele-
vant  social  norms  and  to  focus  media  attention  on  derelict  actors. 229 Per-
haps  such  activity would  be  accompanied  by  market pressures  of various
sorts,  as  consumer action  has had  significant  effects  on  code  enforcement
in  related areas 3 0 A  degree of FCC interest  in  the  existence  of code  viola-
tions would also help.

These  points  raise  a  related  question:  the  appropriate  scope  of any
such code. Undoubtedly  such  a code  was less painful  and easier  to  operate
when  three broadcasters  exhausted  the universe of television. Broadcasters
now  find  themselves  in  competition  with  many  other  entertainment
sources,  including  cable  and the  Internet.  In  these  circumstances,  broad-
casters  are  not  likely  to  constrain  themselves  if their  competitors  are
not  similarly  constrained;  the  competition  for  an  audience  for  news  is
much  affected  by  the  existence  of "tabloid  television,"  and  a rule  limited
to  broadcasters  would raise  an  obvious  question  about fairness.  A  broad-
caster  who  ties  himself to  the  mast may  find himself  with  a  significantly
reduced  audience.  This  point suggests  that in the  development  of a code,
broadcasters  should  perhaps  be joined  by  the  National  Association  of
Cable Television.

By itself, however, a code limited  to broadcasters  should do consider-
able good, even if some broadcasters  are reluctant  to  subscribe to  it. When
the  market  reaches  the  stage in which  broadcasters  are  merely  some  of a

editorial  freedom. See Paige Albiniak,  Preparing for Battle, BROADCASTING  & CABLE,  July  6,  1998, at
22; Fox Still Undecided on Leaving NAB,  Expresses Concerns, CoMM.  DAiLY, Jan.  14,  1999, at 6.

226.  This approach  would  have  special  advantages  in  light of the fact  that  some stations  are  not
members of the NAB.  For NAB stations  that must compete  with nonmember stations, a code creates  an
obvious  competitive risk,  and there  is a continuing  question whether it is  possible to  design strategies,
public or private, to combat this risk.

TELEVISION AND  THE PUBLIC INTEREST

large  number of providers,  with no distinctive  status,  it might make  sense
to  think  of a more  general  code (with  suitable  adjustments  for  particular
kinds  of programmers).3 1 It is  worth  underlining  the  point that,  as  in the
context  of disclosure,  the likelihood of success  will increase  with the exis-
tence  of third-party  monitors,  both public  and  private,  and  also  with  a
threat of more intrusive  action should it prove necessary.3 2

D.  Notes on the First Amendment and Antitrust Law

A  code  for  television broadcasters  might  be  thought  to  raise issues
of  both  constitutional  and  antitrust  law.  The  constitutional  issues  are
relatively  straightforward;  the  antitrust  issues  are  a  bit more  complex.  I
offer a brief discussion here.

There  is  essentially  no  risk  that  a  code  of  the  sort  suggested  here
would  create serious  First Amendment  problems.  By itself, a code is  a pri-
vate  set of guidelines,  and private  guidelines  by  themselves  raise no  First
Amendment  issue- 3  If a  private  group  decides  to  impose  restrictions  on
the  speech  of  its  members,  and  government  is  not  involved,  the  First
Amendment  is irrelevant.'  Of course  things would be different if govern-
ment mandated any  such code.

Nor would  provisions  like those  described  above  be likely  to violate
the  antitrust  laws.  The  Department  of Justice  has  so  concluded,  as  have
district courts  in two important  cases in which the  private antitrust actions
at  issue involved  parts  of previous  codes.  The  district  court in  American
Brands, Inc. v.  National Ass'n  of Broadcasters5  examined  a  claim  that
code  standards  forbidding  cigarette  advertising  violated  antitrust  laws.
That  court  refused  to  issue  an  injunction  against  such  standards.  In
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists v.  National Ass 'n of
Broadcasters, 6  the district  court upheld code  standards  regarding  adver-
tising  aimed at children.  The  courts in both  of these  cases found  the code
standards  reasonable  and in the public  interest.  As I have noted, the most

231. 

For example,  it is hardly  clear that a station devoted to children should  be required to provide

free  air time for political  candidates.

See San  Francisco  Arts  & Athletics,  Inc.  v. United  States  Olympic  Comm.,  483  U.S.  522
(1987)  (holding that the Constitution is  not applicable  to Olympic Committee);  Rendell-Baker  v. Kohn,
457  U.S.  830 (1982)  (holding  that the Constitution  is  inapplicable  to private actors);  Flagg Bros.  v.
Brooks, 436 U.S.  149  (1978)  (noting that  a private contract raises  no First Amendment  issue).  If a code
is  a product of government  threat, and is  effectively required  by  government,  the  First Amendment
comes  into play.  There  can  be no  question  that  a governmentally  mandated  code,  not voluntary  but
taking the form outlined here,  would raise legitimate  constitutional problems.  This  does not necessarily
mean  that the First Amendment  would be  violated, but  it does mean  that  the  code  would have  to  be
tested  for compliance  with  First Amendment  principles,  including  constitutional  limits  on  content
regulation.

recent  code's  disintegration  came  at the  hand  of a  1979  antitrust  action,  in
which  the  Department of Justice  alleged  that certain  Code  provisions  vio-
lated  the  Sherman Act.  But the  Justice  Department's  complaint  was  quite
narrow,  and the  court's  decision 7  would  not invalidate  a  code  of the  sort
suggested  here."  The  television  market's  unique  characteristics  would
allow  a code of the sort porposed  here to survive a "rule  of reason"  inquiry,
which requires  balancing  of the  relevant factors.  It would  be most reason-
able  to  hold  that  any  restrictions  contained  in  the  code  would  promote
competition  as well  as various  public interests  goals, such  as education  of
children,  access for the handicapped,  and  other civic functions.239

E.  Less Puzzling Puzzles

We  are  now in a position  to  disentangle  the  two  puzzles discussed  in
Part  I.B  above.  Why  were  broadcasters  pleased  that  the  proposed  NAB
code would  violate  antitrust  laws?  Why did  they prefer  rigid government
mandates  to  a  flexible,  "play  or pay"  approach?  The  broadcasters  on  the
Committee  favored  a  code  partly  because  they  thought  it  a  good  idea
in  principle  and  partly  because  they  had  little  to  lose  from  it.  Though
generally  "winners,"  they were selected for the Committee  because  of their
commitment,  through  both  words  and  deeds,  to  moderating  some  of the
adverse  effects  of competition.  They  were vulnerable  to  "winner-take-all"
effects  insofar  as  they  were  reluctant  to  engage  in  certain  competitive
practices.  In this  way, a  code  might  even help  them. But  the  NAB  would
not  like  a meaningful  code  at  all.  The  broadcasting  industry  as  a  whole
would be  hurt by  such  a code,  especially  because  cable  television  would
not be bound  by  it. Why should  broadcasters,  in  an intensely  competitive
market,  give  a significant  edge to  cable?  Especially  if the  result would  be
that cable  could take  a lot more,  of the viewing  audience  than it now does?
It is  not  surprising  if broadcasters  who  supply  a  large  degree  of public
interest programming  believe that they would be  net winners with  a code-
and if the broadcasting  industry as  a whole believes  that it would  be a  net
loser.  Such an  industry,  cautious  about invoking  its own  economic  interest
alone, is all too likely to invoke the antitrust  laws (or the First Amendment)
for purely strategic and self-interested  reasons.

This point also  helps explain  the Committee  broadcasters'  skepticism
about "play or pay"  alternatives.  A  set of rigid public interest  requirements
does not hurt them  and may  even help  them, insofar  as it places  their com-
petitors  under  legal  duties  that  they  would  themselves  meet  voluntarily
(because  of their aspirations  or because  of the  particular demands  of their
audience  and  their advertisers).  A  system of "play or pay"  would mean  that

TELEVISION AND  THE PUBLIC INTEREST

these  broadcasters  would  be undercut  by  competitors  who,  unwilling  to
play,  would  pay-and  capture  a  large  audience  share,  in  a  version  of
"winner-take-most."  But this  is not a  convincing  objection  to  a system of
"play  or pay."  It  is  true  that some  of those  who  "play"  will  be at  a com-
petitive  disadvantage  with respect  to  some  of those  who  "pay"  others  to
play  instead.  But by  itself this  competitive  disadvantage  is  not worthy  of
concern,  any  more  than  we  should  be  concerned  when,  in  the  environ-
mental  context,  some  of those who  reduce pollution  are  at  a  competitive
disadvantage  with respect to  those  who, instead  of reducing  pollution, pay
a substantial  fee to  third parties  who have reduced pollution.  The question
is what approach  yields the best outcome  for the public.  If there is too little
public interest broadcasting,  or too much pollution, the  solution  is not the
simple  command  to  "play,"  or to  "reduce,"  but  to  increase  the  price  for
failing to play or for failing  to reduce.2

The best defense of a code  of the sort I have discussed is that it would
produce  "winner-take-less"  outcomes,  in  a  way  that  would  provide
significant  benefits  for  the  public  by  diminishing  some  of  the  adverse
effects  of market competition  and  by  strengthening  broadcaster  norms  in
favor of obligations  to children  and to democratic  values. And  if this  is so,
it  provides  a  general  lesson  about  how  voluntary  private  action  might
sometimes  handle  problems  usually dealt with by direct regulation-and  a
lesson  about  the reflexive  use  of  the  antitrust  laws  to  prevent  producer
cooperation.  A  key  question  is  whether  mechanisms  might  be  created  to
ensure compliance with any  such code.

VII
A SUMMARY

This discussion  has ranged  over  a number of regulatory  tools,  and it
may  be  helpful,  by  way  of  summary,  to  discuss  them  all  briefly  and  at
once.  We  have seen  that both disclosure  and codes  have the  advantage  of
ensuring  a minimal  government  role,  in a way  that reduces  constitutional
concerns  and  also allows  a high  degree  of flexibility.  The  danger  is  that
these remedies  will have little effect;  here the key question is whether  there
are  good  external  monitors,  able  to  impose  reputational  or other  costs  on
those who do poorly.  We have  also seen that "taxes"  on programming  that
does  not  serve  public  interest  goals,  and  subsidies  to  programming  that
does  serve  such goals,  can  have  similar effects.  A principal  problem  with
subsidies is  that they  create an  incentive not to provide  such programming
voluntarily.  The following  table charts  the basic territory:

[Vol.  88:499

Some  of these  tools  could  serve  as  complements  rather than  as alter-
natives.  Disclosure  makes  sense  with  or without  additional  strategies.  It
should be  the  least controversial  item on the  list;  the  only  real  question  is
what else should accompany  it. Disclosure  is likely to work especially  well
in  tandem  with  voluntary  self-regulation,  indeed  the  two  tools  are  natural
allies.  By  contrast,  mandates  and economic  incentives  are  genuine  com-
petitors,  and  in  the  current  context,  economic  incentives  generally  seem
best,  with mandates  operating as a "backstop,"  probably to be eliminated  in
the long term.24

As  I have  emphasized,  these  recommendations  are  designed  for  the
current  stage  of  telecommunications  technology;  they  are  also  likely  to
make  sense  for  the  near  term.  For  the  next  decade,  the  key  question  is
whether  initiatives  designed  for  broadcasters  should  be  applied  to  cable
programmers  as well  (especially  disclosure  and  compliance  with  a code).
In the very  long  term, when broadcasters  occupy  no special role, it  may be
best to  impose  disclosure  requirements  on  general-interest  stations,  and
also to  subsidize  high-quality programming  of various  sorts. A reasonable
conclusion  would  be  that  in  the  long-term,  public  interest  programming
will be best promoted  via  subsidies,  not through  regulation  of any  kind.  In
such  an  era,  much  will  have been  gained  and  much will  also  have  been
lost, with the  fragmentation  of the  television  market,  with  less  in  the  way
of common  experiences,  and, possibly,  with  less  frequent  exposure  to  seri-
ous  coverage  of serious  issues0 2  It  is  too  soon  to  know  whether  the  very
long term will come in the next decade  or long  thereafter.243

One final  note:  The discussion  here  has been focused  on law,  not on
norms  or culture;  but the  argument  for a  certain  conception  of the  social
role of television  bears  at least  as much on  norms and  culture  as  on law.  It
is  possible  to  think  that  before  long,  it  will  not  make  sense  to  impose
regulatory  requirements  on  CBS,  NBC,  ABC,  and Fox,  any  more than  it
makes  sense  to  impose  regulatory  requirements  on  Newsweek,  Time,  The
New  York  Times,  USA  Today, National Review,  or The New  Republic. I
have  argued  against this  conclusion,  but it must be taken  seriously. Even  if
it is  accepted,  it is  crucial  to  say  that  those  who  provide  television,  like
those  who produce  newspapers  and  magazines,  have a distinctive  cultural
responsibility,  associated  with  the  promotion  of  a  democratic  culture.
Many  people  not  subject  to  regulation  take  this  responsibility  seriously;
many do  not. If law  diminishes  as  a constraining  force,  it is  all  the  more
important  to  speak  on  behalf  of the basic  norms-protection  of children,

serious  attention  to  serious  issues,  inclusion  of a  wide  variety  of  social
groups,  including  the hearing  impaired-that have undergirded  regulatory
law  in the past. If it flourishes,  a "trustee  culture"  can do much  of the work
of the law.

CONCLUSION

Much of the discussion here has  involved appropriate regulatory tools.
For the most part, the policy  instruments of choice  should not involve rigid
dictates  or commands,  which  are expensive  and potentially  counterproduc-
tive,  and in any  case ill-suited  to  an  era of rapidly changing  technology.  I
have  suggested  a strong preference  for the less intrusive  options of disclo-
sure,  economic  incentives,  and  voluntary  self-regulation.  Disclosure  has
been  a surprisingly  successful,  low-cost  strategy  in  other areas  of regula-
tory  law.  If certain  broadcasting  is  seen  as  a  public  good,  analogous  to
clean  air, economic  incentives  may be able to  accomplish  a good deal,  and
to  do  so  at  relatively  low  cost.  Because  competitive  pressures  are  fre-
quently  the  engine  behind poor  broadcaster  performance,  voluntary  self-
regulation  may turn out to be a desirable  kind of "cartel,"  helping to  coun-
teract short-term  interests. Through  this route it may be possible to  develop
an  intermediate  system of controls,  responding  to  the market and nonmar-
ket failures  of current markets,  but without introducing the  rigidity  and in-
efficiencies  of  command-and-control  regulation.  These  points  hold
notwithstanding  current  and anticipated  technological  developments.2  Of
course,  the  appropriate  attitude  toward  such  instruments  is  pragmatic,
empirical,  and  experimental,  rather  than dogmatic  or theological.  If these
instruments  fail to work, it will be worthwhile  to consider alternatives.

If measures  of this kind  have promise  in the  areas  of environmental
protection  and  public  interest  programming,  there  is  every  reason  to
explore  them in other, less familiar  contexts as well. In many  areas  of law,
command-and-control  regulation has proved  a partial  or  complete  failure,
and the natural  alternative-a  system  of well-defined  property  rights  and
freedom  of contract-may  produce  serious  problems  of its  own.  In such
circumstances,  any  "third way,"  if it is  ultimately to  develop  for the mod-
em  regulatory  state,  is  likely  to  place  heavy reliance  on  disclosure,  eco-
nomic incentives,  and voluntary  self-regulation.

See Goldberg  et al.,  supra note 5,  at 296 (footnote  omitted),  arguing that:

A further point of some importance is  that there  is no  single new media form or market,  and
there is  never likely to  be such uniformity. Markets  remain  distinct;  for example  there is  still
a  clear  distinction  between  television-type  services  and  on-line  services.  Technological
convergence  may  be  imminent  in  the  form  of  television  Internet  access  (or  Web  TV)
becoming cheaply available,  but the cultures  remain radically different.  Indeed, in the context
of television,  it  seems  likely that, though delivery  forms may  change,  the  culture may  not,
and that new  types  of media  may  supplement  rather than  replace  existing ones.  Again  the
message is one of caution  before we scrap  existing regulatory  arrangements.

CALIFORNIA  LAW  REVIEW

[Vol.  88:499

The most fundamental  points involve the  appropriate understanding  of
a system  of free expression-an understanding  of what gives  such a system
its  motivation and point. I have emphasized  the  external benefits  that  come
from public  interest programming  and  also the  peculiar  characteristics  of
the  television market,  where  viewers,  or eyeballs,  are  a  commodity  pro-
vided  to  advertisers.  Because  of the collective  action problem,  regulatory
efforts  that attempt to promote democratic  goals, or that provide  captioning
for  the hearing  impaired,  are  easily defended  in principle.  But I have  also
argued  that purely  economic  principles  should  be rejected  as  the  founda-
tion  for  communications  policy. With  respect  to  public interest  program-
ming,  viewers' 
tastes  may  be  a  product  of  an  undesirable  set  of
communications  options,  and in their capacity as citizens, people  may weli
want to  make things better rather than worse. Especially  in light of the role
of the communications  media  in  the production  of culture-and  on  both
preferences  and values-it is  entirely  legitimate  for  a democratic  govern-
ment to refuse  to make  "consumption  choices"  the  exclusive basis  for pol-
icy  design.  I  have  emphasized  that  a  public  committed  to  deliberative
democracy  might  well  support  initiatives  designed  to  provide  better  pro-
gramming  for children  and  better coverage  of public issues. 45  So long  as
they are  subject to  democratic  control,  such initiatives  should be  regarded
not as a paternalistic  interference  with private  choices  by a regulatory  elite,
but  as  an  effort by  a self-governing  public  to  promote  a political  culture
that  is  consistent  with its  own  highest  aspirations.  Above  all,  this  is  the
sense  in which  there  is  a  difference  between  the  public  interest  and what
interests the public.
