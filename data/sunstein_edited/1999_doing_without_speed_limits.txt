INTRODUCTION

In  late  1995,  Montana  became  the  first  and  only  state  to  eliminate  a  nu-
merical  daytime  speed  limit  on  its  interstate  highways. 
Instead,  the  state
adopted  a  "Basic  Rule"  of "reasonable  and  prudent"  daytime  driving.  The
law  produced  a  heated  debate  about  its  consequences,  the  relationship  be-
tween  norms  and  law,  and  the  choice  between  rules  and  standards  in  statutes

affecting  primary  conduct.  Montana's  endeavor  to  regulate  drivers'  conduct
without  a  numerical  speed  limit  offers  an  intriguing  opportunity  to  explore
the  role  of social  norms  in regulating  behavior,  the  importance  and  feasibility
of cooperation,  and  the  possibility  of controlling  behavior  through  relatively
open-ended  law.

In  this  essay,  we  investigate 

the  consequences  of  Montana's  daytime
driving  rules.  We  examine  the  law  itself,  its  effects  on  driving  behavior  and
law  enforcement,  and  recent  attempts  to  overturn  the  law.  Specifically,  we
evaluate  the  law's  impact  on  the  motoring  public  and  Montana  as  a  whole.
We  also  consider  the  Basic  Rule's  effect  on  legal  standards:  Does  the  law's
subjective  nature  promote  arbitrary  and  ineffective  enforcement?  We  ex-
plore  the  effect  of the  law  on  so-called  "rule  of law"  values  of both  drivers
and  police  officers. 
In  late  1998,  the  Montana  Supreme  Court  invalidated
the  Basic  Rule  on  due  process  grounds,  and  the  ultimate  fate  of  the
"reasonable  and  prudent"  rule  remains  unclear. 
In  Part  VI,  we  offer  a  brief
discussion  of that  issue.

Our  basic  findings  are  as  follows:
1.  In  the  short  term,  the  change  in  the  speed  limit  had  few  consequences
for  the  driving  behavior  of  Montana  citizens,  in  terms  of overall  speed  and
safety.  Most  citizens  appeared  to  coordinate  their  behavior  around  a  certain
area  of  appropriate  speed,  both  during  the  period  of  an  official  55  mile-per-
hour  (mph)  limit  and  after  the  return  of the  Basic  Rule.  This  point  suggests
the  possibility  that  driving  habits  may  outstrip  the  law. 
Indeed,  we  suspect
that  much  of driving  behavior  is  governed  by  informal  norms.  Those  norms
govern  speed  as  well  as  many  other topics,  and  have  a  far  greater  degree  of
flexibility  and  specificity  than  any  law.  Of  course  these  norms  operate
against  a  backdrop  set  by  speed  limits  in  other  states  and  past  limits  in  Mon-
tana.  It  is  hard  to  know  how  fast  Montanans  would  drive  without  this  back-
drop.

2.  The  change  in  the  speed  limit  had  the  significant  consequence  of en-
couraging  very  fast  and  somewhat  reckless  driving  by  tourists.  Many  of
these drivers  appeared  to  be  attracted  to  Montana  by  virtue  of  its  Basic  Rule.
This  point  also  has  an  important  implication;  a  state  that  allows  very  fast
driving  (because  of a  high  speed  limit  in  the  form  of a  rule  or  standard)  may
find  itself  becoming  a  "speed  magnet,"  which  may  produce  unanticipated
dangers.

3.  Partly  as  a  result  of (2),  aggregate  mortality  and  morbidity  rates  on  the
interstate  highways  of Montana  increased  after  the  switch  to  the  Basic  Rule.
Both  statistics,  however,  generally  remained  within  historical  fluctuating
ranges,  and  a  sharp  upward  spike  in  1997  does  not  offer  any  unambiguous
lesson.

4.  Even  taking  (2)  and  (3) into  account,  the  aggregate  motor  vehicle  acci-
dent  rate  did  not  increase  enormously  in  Montana,  perhaps  because  the  Basic
Rule  encouraged  drivers  to  use  the  interstate  highways,  which  are  relatively
safe.  This  point  suggests  a  final  important  implication;  one  of  the  conse-

quences  of decreasing  safety  on  interstate  highways  may  be  to  increase  over-
all  safety,  if the  decrease  is  a  result  of a  change  in policy  that  shifts  drivers
away  from  relatively  more  perilous  rural  roads  and  makes  interstate  driving
more  attractive.

5.  The  Basic  Rule  has  created  serious  problems  for  law  enforcement. 
Its
vague  nature  subjects  the  Basic  Rule  to  many  different  interpretations  by
both  drivers  and  law  enforcement  officials.  The  results  have  included  in-
creased  roadside  confrontations  between  officers  and  motorists,  and  also  a
judicial  and  administrative  backlog  in adjudicating  possible  violations.

6.  There  is  some  evidence  that  motorists  are  becoming  accustomed  to  the
law.  For example,  traffic  citations  for  Basic  Rule  violations,  initially  soaring
in  the  law's  first  year,  declined  as  drivers  apparently  adapted  to  the  flexible
standards.  Similarly,  after  a  sharp  spike  in  fatalities  in  1997,  Montana's
roadways  became  safer  in  1998,  the  law's  third  year  of operation.

In  the  end,  we  do  not  mean  to  say  that  the  Basic  Rule  is  a  good  or  a  bad
idea.  The  most  important  and  interesting  elements  of  this  story  lie  in  the
details  rather  than  the  "bottom  line."

I.  MONTANA  AND  THE  BASIC  RULE

A.  Some Relevant Facts

To  understand  the  Basic  Rule,  it  is  necessary  to emphasize  that  Montana  is
a  large  and  thinly  populated  area.  With  147,047  square  miles  of territory,  it
stands  as  the  fourth  largest  state.'  Montana's  population,  however,  totals
approximately  870,000,  making  it  the  third  most  sparsely  populated  state 2
with  an  average  of just  six  people  per  square  mile. 3  Billings,  with  its  87,000
residents,  is  the  state's  largest  city. 4  Yet  Billings  does  not  face  the  suburban
sprawl  of other  metropolitan  areas;  the  first  traffic  light outside  of the  city  is
145  miles  away  in  Miles  City,  population  8,400. 5

Traveling  Montana's  vast  expanse  via  its  interstate  highways  can  be  rela-
tively  hazardous.  The  state  has  88,000  miles of highway. 6  There  is  no  sepa-
rate  state  police  force  and  only  212  Highway  Patrol  officers  monitor  the

roads. 7  As  of  1995,  Montana's  rate  of 2.3  fatalities  per  100  million  vehicle
miles  was  considerably  above  the  national  average  of  1.8  deaths  per  100
million  vehicle  miles. 8  Moreover,  the  deadliest  stretch  of  road  in the  country
and  two  of  the  nation's  three  most  perilous  highway  areas  are  located  in
Montana,  with  fatality  rates  of 6.206  and  4.031  per  100  million  miles,  re-
spectively. 9  In  sum,  Montana's  wide  open  spaces  afford  ample  distance  and
danger  for  the  motoring  public.

B.  The Fall and Rise of the Basic Rule

Before  the  enactment  of federally  mandated  speed  limits,  Montana  gov-
erned  its  highways  under  its  Basic  Rule.' 0  This  law,  passed  in  1955,"1  ac-
corded  motorists  substantial  freedom  in  conducting  themselves  on  the  road,
requiring  drivers  to  operate  their  vehicles  in a

careful  and  prudent  manner  and  at  a  rate  of  speed  no  greater  than  is
reasonable  and  proper  under  the  conditions  existing  at  the  point  of  op-
eration,  taking  into  account  the  amount  and  character  of traffic,  condi-
tion  of brakes,  weight  of vehicle,  grade  and  width  of highway,  condi-
tion  of surface,  and  freedom  of obstruction  to the  view  ahead.12

Citizens  of  Montana  regarded  the  Basic  Rule  as  practical  and  a  necessary
way  of life,  viewing  fast  driving  in  the  words  of one  inhabitant,  as  a  "God-
given  right."' 3

Congress  altered  the  situation  in  1974. 

In  the  wake  of the  1973  Arab  oil
embargo, 
the  Federal  Aid  Highways
Amendments  of  1974  and  imposed  a  "National  Maximum  Speed  Limit"  of
55  mph. 14 
Initially  urged  as  a  conservation  effort,  the  law  rapidly  gained

authorized  number  of  Highway  Patrol  officers;  however,  Montana  Highway  Patrol  Major
Bert  Obert  noted  that  the  Highway  Patrol  does  not  operate  at  this  full  contingent  and  usu-
ally  fields  slightly  more  than  200  officers.  For  example,  in  1998  there  were  206  Highway
Patrol  officers.  See  Telephone  Interview  with  Bert  Obert,  Major,  Montana  Highway  Pa-

support  as  a  safety  measure,  reducing  highway  fatalities.15  The  federal  gov-
ernment  enforced  the  mandate  by  restricting  highway  funds  for  those  states
that  refused  to  establish  the  new  limit.' 6  As  a  result,  every  state  acquiesced
and  55  mph  emerged  as  the  national  speed  limit.17

Its  libertarian  populace' 8  not  content  to  bow  to  Washington's  edict,  Mon-
tana  passed  a  "[fluel  conservation  speed  limit"  to  achieve  nominal  compli-
ance  with  the  federal  government's  ultimatum.' 9  The  law,  explicitly  de-
signed  to  "insure  conservation  of a  resource," 20  established  violations  of  the
speed  limit  as  misdemeanors  not  reported  against  a  driver's  insurance  rec-
ord. 21  Infractions  cost  the  driver  $5,  payable  directly  to the  Highway  Patrol
officer  issuing  the  ticket. 22  Simultaneously,  Montana's  legislature  enacted
another  law  stating  that  its  fuel  conservation  speed  limit  would  remain  effec-
tive  "only  as  long  as  the  establishment  of  those  speed  limits  by  the  state  is
required  by  federal  law  as  a  condition  to  the  state's  continuing  eligibility  to
receive  [federal  highway]  funds  ...  "23

Montana's  motorists  virtually  ignored  the  newly  imposed  speed  limits;
driving  behavior  was  largely  a  function  of  norms,  not  of  law. 24  Partly  be-

the  fuel crisis ended  because  of presumed  safety  benefits).

It  is  important  to  note  that  Montana's  Basic
Rule continued  to remain  in  effect even  during the period  when  the  fuel  conservation speed
limit  applied.  For  example,  if  a driver  was  stopped  for  driving  120  mph  on  a  road  on
which  the  55  mph  fuel  conservation  speed  limit  applied,  he  would  be  issued  a Basic  Rule

cause  they  were  accustomed  to  driving  under  the  Basic  Rule  and  partly  be-
cause  of the  weak  sanctions  for  speeding,  the  state's  citizens  continued  their
basic  driving  patterns  in  the  decades  following  1974.  As  one  newspaper  de-
scribed  the  situation,  "Montana  drivers  are  known  for  flouting  the  law,  and
the  state  for  winking  at  such  behavior. 25  Studies  reported  that  a  majority  of
motorists  disobeyed  Montana's  speed  limit  on  both  interstates  and  two-lane
highways. 26   Critics  derided 
limit  as  "irrelevant,"
"practically  meaningless,"  and  "a  joke." 27  Moreover,  some  disobeyed  the
speed  limit  on  principle,  as  a  protest  against  federal  intrusion. 28  Thus,  the
very  existence  of the  law  created  at  least  a  degree  of faster  driving. 29  Folk-
lore  emerged  regarding  the  laxity  of  enforcement. 30  The  state  traffic  high-
way  spokesman  recognized 
the  dilemma,  acknowledging,  "'You  cannot
choose  the  speed  limit  for  people,  . .
[t]he  truth  is  that  it  can't be  enforced
unless  people  agree  with  it.'"31

the  national  speed 

The  lax  compliance  took  a  toll  on  law  enforcement.  Despite  writing  ap-
proximately  66,000  $5  tickets  per  year,  the  Highway  Patrol  described  the
law  as  "'a  nondeterrent  to  speeding.'" 32  The  law  also  had  a  corrosive  effect

the  widespread  violations,  noting,  "[niobody  drove  the  speed  limit  anyway."

29  The  social  meaning  of  fast driving  became,  in  the aftermath  of the  federal  speed  limit
law,  a  kind  of rebellion  against  federal  intrusion,  and  in  some  quarters  the  result  was  to
spur  faster driving.  See,  e.g.,  Lawrence  Lessig,  The Regulation of Social Meaning, 62  U.
CHI.  L.  REV.  943,  951  (1995)  (discussing  the  role  of social  meaning  in  human  behavior).

30  For  example,  Representative  Pat  Williams,  Montana's  only  Congressman,  recounted
an  anecdote  where  a  driver  paid  a  patrolman  in  cash  and  the  motorist  began  to  close  his
window  to drive  away.  The  officer  stopped  the  individual  and  said  "'Hold  on,  old  timer,
hold  onto  that  ticket.  It's  good  for  the  rest  of the  day.'"  Kenworthy,  supra note  13,  at
A3.  In  another  Montana  driving  tradition,  a  driver  and  each  of his  passengers  would place
"$5  on  the  dashboard,  and  if the  driver  made  it  from  Billings  to  Helena  without  getting
stopped,  he  won  the kitty."

on  the  public's  perception  of  law  enforcement.  The  head  of  the  Highway
Patrol  noted  that  motorists'  disregard  for  speed  limits  "'caused  disrespect  for
us  [the  Highway  Patrol]  in  particular  because  we  were  burdened  with  en-
forcing  the  law.''33  Furthermore,  the  law  demoralized  the  officers  them-
selves.  One  patrolman  lamented,  "'You  wondered  how  much  good  you
were  doing  out  there. "'34

Montana  received  its  reprieve  from  federal  regulation  of  its  interstate
highways  with  the  enactment  of  the  National  Highway  System  Designation
Act  (the  "NHSDA")  in  1995. 35  Spurred  by  the  Republicans'  desire  to  limit
the  role  of  the  national  government,  Congress  enacted  the  NHSDA  by  the

reason  that  we  avoid  firm  conclusions  about  the  effects  of  the  change  in  Montana  is  the

Proponents  of  the  NHSDA  mounted  their  own  public  relations  effort.
They  argued  that  the  law  would  simply  legalize  existing  behavior  by  drivers,
and  bring  the  law  more  in  accordance  with  informal  norms  already  produc-
ing  sufficiently  safe  driving. 45  Supporters  downplayed  the  safety  fears,  not-
ing  improvements  in  drunk-driving  laws,  seat  belts,  air  bags,  and  anti-lock
brakes.46

On  December  9,  1995,  Montana  reverted  to  its  Basic  Rule  of reasonable

and  prudent  conduct to  govern  its  roadways. 47

II.  DRIVING  HABITS

A.  What Montanans Did and Did Not Do

What  was  the  consequence  of this  change?  In  the  short  term,  the  effects
were  minimal.  Throughout  1996  drivers  did  not  significantly  alter  their  con-
duct under  their  new-found  roadway  freedom. 48  Although  the  percentage  of

47 See  Kenworthy,  supra note  13,  at  A3.  The  new  law,  however,  provides  stiff  penal-
ties.  Unlike  the  conservation  speed  limit,  under  the  Basic  Rule  fines  can  range  from  $70
to  $500 and  count  against  a  driver's  insurance  record.  See  MONT.  CODE ANN.  §  61-8-303

along  the  road  would  have  little  effect  on  the death  toll.").

motorists  traveling  above  80  mph  increased  from  2%  to  5 %,49 
total  average
speeds  increased  negligibly,  from  72  to  74  mph  during  the  law's  first  few
months. 50  In  fact,  speed  played  no  part  in the  first  twelve  traffic  fatalities. 51
Lynn  Conn,  a  Helena  resident,  seemed  to  typify  Montanans'  attitude  toward
52
the  Basic  Rule:  "'I'm  a  65  mph  driver,  and  I  imagine  I'll just  stay  there.'
The  Director  of the  state's  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Division  said,  "'[a]  lot  of
press  outside  the  state  did  not assume  Montanans  had  a  modicum  of common
sense  .... I  still  give  the  average  Montanan  a  lot  of credit  for  pretty  much
driving  in  a  reasonable  and  prudent  manner.  The.  world  is  not  going  to

mains  relatively  constant  in  terms  of  speed,  although  speed  limit  proponents
warn  that motorists,  now  more  accustomed  to the  increased  roadway  speeds,
may  be  driving  less  carefully. 54

Three  factors  may  explain  the  constancy  of  drivers'  behavior.  First,  it
may  take  a  significant  period  of  time  for  a  change  in the  speed  limit  to  pro-
duce  changes  in  driving  behavior.  Second,  as  Montanans  like  to  insist,  the
state's  motorists  appear  to  possess  good judgment  and  honed  ability  in  trav-
ersing  its  highways. 55  This  accounts  for  the  striking  72  mph  speeds  before
the  repeal  of the  law  and  the  nominal  initial  increase  thereafter.  Republican
Governor  Marc  Racicot  contended  that,  "'[w]e  tend  to  respect  each  other,
instead  of aiming  for  one  another.  I have  great  faith  that  Montanans  will  be

concerned  with  safety  and  security.'
Montanans  are  "'used  to  driving  long  distances,  and  they  know  which  roads
are  safe  at  which  speed.'

57

The  third  and  perhaps  the  most  compelling  explanation  of drivers'  con-
stant  speeds  may  be  Montana's  often  treacherous  road  conditions.  These
conditions,  more  than  formal  law,  may  dictate  much driving  behavior.  Inter-
state  drivers  in Montana  face  a  litany  of perils:  brutal  weather,  icy  pavement,

roads  not  designed  for  high-speed 
travel,  animal  crossings,  and  sharp
curves.5 8  Epitomizing  both  Montanan  drivers'  judgment  and  the  often  chal-
lenging  road  conditions,  one  resident  stated,  "'[i]f  you  don't  drive  in  a  rea-
sonable  and  prudent  manner,  you  end  up  in the  ditch."' 59  A  visiting  reporter
said  that  in  Montana,  "'[t]he  real  limits  are  set  by  the  land.'" 6°  Thus  it  ap-
pears  that  driving  behavior  in  Montana  is  largely  a  function  of local  knowl-
edge;  it  is  partly  for this  reason  that  the  change  in law  was  far less  important
to behavior  than it  was  feared  to be.  Before  the  abandonment  of the  national
speed  limit,  citizens  of  Montana  were  violating  it  regularly,  and  when  the
abandonment  occurred,  those  citizens  continued  to do  what  they were  doing.

B.  Tourists and Speed Magnets

Tourists  are  the  central  exception  to  motorists'  constant  driving  behavior.
The  repeal  of the  national  speed  limit  turned  Montana  into  a  national  speed
magnet.

Montana  receives  an  estimated  seven  million  visitors  annually. 6 1  Many  of
these  outsiders  came  to be  known,  or  more  appropriately,  derided,  as  "speed
tourists." 62  Such  visitors,  spurred  by  their  desire to  drive  fast,  descended  on
the  "Montanabahn." 63  Their  exploits  became  legendary.  A  Porsche  driver
boasted  that  he  traveled  from  Missoula  to  Billings,  a  distance  of  350  miles,
in  less  than  three  hours; 64  a  Minnesota  car  club  wanted  to  race  "700  Cor-
across  the  state  at  150  miles  an  hour;" 65 a  writer  for  Forbes hit  a

top  speed  of  116  mph  in  a  Miata; 66 fifteen  test  engineers  drove  a  convoy  of
Mercedes  through  the  state  "at  speeds  in  excess  of  95  mph;" 67  a  French
tiremaker  "wanted  to  run  tests  at  140  mph;" 68  and  lastly,  a  reporter  for
Popular Mechanics drove  a  high-test  minivan,  aptly  named  "The  Montana,"
across  the  state  at  113  mph  to  review  the  vehicle. 69

The  resulting  behavior  outraged  state  officials:  "'I think  [the  planned  Basic
Rule  violations]  show  a  real  lack  of respect,  not only  for  the  law  in Montana,
but  for  the  rights  and  safety  of  Montana  drivers  and  tourists  .... Even  if
these  were  professional  drivers,  not  everyone  else  on  the  road  was." '' 70
Highway  Patrol  officials  were  equally  livid.  One  officer  questioned  a  mo-
torist  who  was  stopped  for  driving  107  mph  over  a  bridge  deck,  asking,
"'What  would  happen  to  you  in  your  home  state?"' 71  When  the  man  re-
sponded  that  at  home  he  would  have  been  charged  with  reckless  driving,  the
officer  questioned,  "'Well,  what  makes  you  think  it's  all  right  to  do  that  in
this  state?" 72

The  influx  of tourists  altered  both  average  speeds  and  highway  fatalities.
But  before  analyzing  these  statistics,  it  is  important  to  note  their  limitations.
Most  importantly,  the  Highway  Patrol's  statistics  lack  appropriate  detail  in
determining  the  full  impact  of Basic  Rule  driving  patterns.  For  example,  the
statistics  do  not  reveal  how  many  of the  out-of-staters'  accidents  occurred  at
times  when  the  Basic  Rule  was  not  the  governing  law  and  a  numerical  speed
limit  was  in effect. 73  Nor  do  the  reports  specify  what  percentage  of the  out-
of-state  drivers'  accidents  involved  factors  other  than  speed,  including  alco-
hol  or  failure  to  wear  seat  belts,  both  significant  contributors  to  highway  fa-
talities.  Lastly,  fatality  statistics  tend  to  fluctuate  considerably  each  year,
even  under  conditions  when  the  posted  speed  limit  remained  constant,  again
undercutting  the  impact of such  annual  comparisons. 74

[Vol.  79:155

Within  the  context  of  the  preceding  paragraph's  disclaimer,  noticeable
driving  patterns,  especially  those  involving  out-of-state  motorists,  began  to
emerge. 75  Although  the  average  speed  increased  only  2  miles  per  hour  dur-
ing  the  Basic  Rule's  first  few  months, 76  by  the  close  of  the  law's  first  year,
average  speeds  climbed  to  78  mph  on  the.  interstate, 77 in  significant  part  (it
appears)  because  of tourists. 78  Moreover,  a  Highway  Patrol  study  indicated
that  "60  percent  of  the  cars  traveling  more  than  85  mph  were  from  out  of
state.  The  figure  was  75  percent  for  those  traveling  more  than  95  mph."79
Another  investigation  documented  that  out-of-staters,  particularly  Canadians,
drive  at higher  speeds  than residents  on  Montana's  roads. 80

The  Montana  Highway  Patrol's  roadway  safety  statistics  tend  to  support
the  perception  of  tourists  as  the  more  dangerous  drivers.  From  1996  to
1997,  the  number  of  out-of-state  vehicles  involved  in  fatal  accidents  in-
creased  by  38%,81  and  the  number  of roadway  deaths  involving  out-of-state
vehicles  increased  by  69%  during  the  same  one-year  span.82  These  numbers
should,  of course,  be  put  in perspective.  For example,  non-Montanans  were
involved  in  only  23%  of  fatal  accidents  in  199683  and  only  26%  in  199784-

that  out-of-state  vehicles were  involved  in  52  deaths  between  January  1,  1997  and  August
18,  1997,  but just 35  between  January  1, 1998  and August  18,  1998).

75  State  officials  blame  misinformation,  misunderstanding  and  the  misconception  that
motorists  may  drive  as  fast  as  they  want  for  the  tourists'  elevated  speeds and  reckless  be-
havior.  See Henderson,  supra  note  58,  at 3.

76  See  Knickerbocker,  supra  note  7,  at  3 (noting  that  the  average  auto  speed  increased

hardly  an  overwhelming  proportion  of  roadway  crashes.  Similarly,  non-
Montanans  were  involved  in  only  24%  of roadway  deaths  in  1996  and  30%
in  1997.85  These  statistics  suggest  a  simple  conclusion.  Most  fatal  accidents
do  not  include  out-of-staters,  but  the  Basic  Rule  attracted  unsafe  drivers  from
out  of  state,  and  this  helped  produce  an  increase  in  fatalities  including  non-
residents.

C.  A  Note on  Coordination

The  varying  driving  habits of Montanans  and  out-of-staters  indicate  a  gen-
eral  coordination  problem  under  the  law;  each  motorist may  interpret  the  Ba-
sic  Rule  differently,  thereby  causing  significant  divergences  in  traffic  flow.
Such  speed  disparities  can  be  perilous,  potentially  increasing  the  "risk  of
crashes  and  other  hazardous  traffic  situations,  such  as  unsafe  lane  changes
and  following  too  closely."86  A  Highway  Patrol  study  estimated  that  the
number  of people  traveling  with  the  general  traffic  flow  decreased  to  a  rec-
ord  low  of 41 %.87  This  is  important  because  accidents  may  be  a  function  of
flow  rather  than  mere  speed.  Hence  a  numerical  speed  limit  has  an  advan-
tage  to  the  extent  that  it  provides  a  number  around  which  drivers  may  coor-
dinate  their  behavior.  The  significant increase  in fatalities  in  1997  may  have
resulted  partly  from  this  lack  of coordination.

D.  Early Results

Despite  the  slightly  elevated  speeds  and  potential  traffic  flow  disparities,
the  statistics  tallying  the  Basic  Rule's  effects,  measured  in  terms  of fatal  ac-
cidents  and  total  roadway  deaths,  remain  inconclusive.  During  the  first  year
under  the  Basic  Rule,  both  fatal  accidents  and  total  roadway  deaths  declined
by  4.8%  and  7.9%,  respectively. 88  Fatal  accidents  on  interstate  highways,

the  roads  where  the  Basic  Rule  most commonly  applies,  did  increase  from  33
in  1995  to  37  in  1996,  although  the  latter  was  below  the  39 lethal  crashes  re-
corded  in  1994.89

Statistics  from  this  first  year  appeared  to  suggest  that  proponents  of the
Basic  Rule  were  correct  on  some  disputed  questions. 
In  particular,  support-
ers  contended  that  increased  speeds  on  highways  lured  motorists  away  from
dangerous  country  roads  and  onto  better-designed,  more  expedient  high-
ways. 90  Consequently,  although  interstate  deaths  increased,  the  Basic  Rule
promoted  safety  by  decreasing  total  deaths  on  all  roads. 9'  The  first  year  un-
der  the  Basic  Rule  seemed  to  fulfill  the  promise  of efficient,  self-regulating,
and  most  surprisingly,  safer,  travel  on  Montana's  roads.

In  the  following  year  the  safety  tide  turned  dramatically.  During  1997,
fatal  accidents  increased  by  26%  and  total  roadway  deaths  soared  by  34%.92
Speed  proved  particularly  lethal.  Measuring  those  crashes  where  speed  was
a  factor,  fatal  accidents  increased  39%93  and total  deaths  rose by  47%. 94

Yet  the  pattern  reversed,  though  not  as  markedly,  in  1998.  As  of August
18,  1998,  comparing  the  year-ago  period,  fatal  accidents  increased  a  meager
.77%95  and  total  roadway  deaths  actually  declined  by  6.2%.96  Even  the  pre-
sumably  virulent  element  of  speed  proved  less  troublesome  in  1998.  Again
comparing  year-ago  periods,  fatal  crashes  in  which  speed  was  a  factor  de-
creased  by  12%97  and  total  roadway  deaths  involving  speed  as  a  factor  de-
creased  by  19%.98

DOING WITHOUT SPEED LIMITS

This  data  is  even  less  conclusive  than  the  vacillating  numbers  indicate.
For  example,  when  comparing  1996  to  1997,  excepting  those  accidents
where  a  numerical  speed  limit  was  in  effect  (i.e.,  non-Basic  Rule  times  or
zones),  the  increases  in  fatal  accidents  and  total  roadway  deaths  amounted  to
15 %99  and  28 %, 100  respectively-higher  numbers  from  the  previous  year,  but
not  as  devastating  as  the  original  figures.  Deleting  those  accidents  where  al-
cohol  was  a  factor  further  ameliorates  the  situation.  Calculating  fatal  acci-
dents  and  total  deaths  without those  incidents  where  alcohol  was  a  factor,  the
numbers  rise  a  modest  13%1o  and  19%,102  respectively.  Even  the  specter  of
unbridled  Basic  Rule  speed,  seemingly  a  leading  factor  in  roadway  deaths,
may be  less  important  than it  seems  in light  of the  complexity  in  tracing  cau-
sation.  The  Highway  Patrol  suggested,  "'[i]t's  really  difficult  to  pin  down
one  factor  and  say  this  is  the  primary  cause  ... 
[or]  factor  that  resulted  in
this crash  and perhaps  this death."10 3  In  short,  driving  safety  under  the  Basic
Rule  fluctuates,  producing  relatively  less  hazardous  motoring  in  1996  and
year-to-date  1998,  while  exacerbating  roadway  fatalities  in  1997.  Equally
important,  the  Basic  Rule  stands  as  only  one  factor  in  roadway  safety  analy-
sis;  conditions  such  as  alcohol  and  unsafe  driving  during  times  or  in  zones
with  numerical  speed  limits  also  were  significant  elements  in  this  multi-
faceted  problem.  Of  course  it  is  possible  that  some  of these  conditions  are
connected  with  the  Basic  Rule.  Dangerous  driving  while  drunk  may  be  ag-
gravated  in  the  absence  of  a  numerical  speed  limit,  and  reckless  driving  in
zones  without  such  limits  may  have  a  "spillover"  effect  on  zones  with  nu-
merical  limits.

There  is  also  reason  to  question  the  meaning  of the  fatality  figures  them-
selves,  because  such  data  varies  enormously  from  year  to  year.  For  exam-
ple,  from  1987  to  1988  Montana  roadway  deaths  decreased  by  15%,  while
increasing  by  17%  from  1989  to  1990.104  Consider the  following  chart:

Measured  in  historical  context,  the  34%  increase  in  roadway  fatalities  in
1997  appears  to  be  a  statistical  anomaly  within  this  fluctuating  /range,  while
the  aggregate  of almost  three  years under  the  Basic  Rule  is  not  greatly  out  of
line  with  historic  patterns  of overall  roadway  death  variations.  106  Some  state
lawmakers  have  so  urged,  with  one  asserting,  "'[a]s  far as  I can  see,  the  sta-
[a  numerical  speed  limit].  . . . One  year's
tistics  aren't  there  to  warrant' 
worth  of statistics  are  not  enough  to  make  a  determination." 10 7  The  Director
of  Montana's  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Division  captured  the  essence  of  the
fatality-rate  debate,  noting,  "[i]f  you're  looking  for  a  compelling  reason  to
have  a  maximum speed  limit,  you  won't  find it  in the  data." 0 8

In  conclusion,  the  Basic  Rule  has  done  little  to  alter  Montanans'  driving
behavior.  Tourists,  however,  relish  the  lack  of numerical  limits,  potentially
contributing  to  divergent  traffic  flows and  increased  overall  speeds.  Overall,
the  nascent  fatality  figures,  representing  a  decrease  in deaths  in  1996,  a  sub-
stantial  increase  in  1997,  and  a  subsequent  decline  in  1998  year-to-date  com-

parisons,  suggest  a possible  increase  in unsafe  driving,  but  offer  an  inconclu-
sive  verdict  on  Basic  Rule  safety.

III.  TRADEOFFS

The  Basic  Rule  carries  with  it  both  advantages  and  disadvantages.  Al-
though  we  cannot  undertake  a  full  cost-benefit  analysis  here,  we  can  cast
light  on  some  of the  important  variables.  Part  of  the  analysis  involves  a
form  of "risk-risk  tradeoffs,"109  which  occur  when  the  regulation  of one  risk
affects  another  risk.  Just  as  regulation  of one  source  of  environmental  dan-
ger  (such  as  nuclear  power  plants)  may  increase  the  danger  from  another
source  (such  as  coal-fired  power  plants),  so  too  for  speed  limits. 
Increasing
or  decreasing  speed  limits  may  increase  some  risks  while  decreasing  others.
For  example,  a  higher  speed  limit  on  an  interstate  highway  may  increase
deaths  on  the  interstates  while  reducing  the  use  of,  and  deaths  on,  less  trav-
eled,  more  dangerous  roads.  Hence,  an  increased  speed  limit  may  save  ag-
gregate  lives.  This  section  seeks  to  identify  and  analyze  some  of  the  most
important tradeoffs.

A.  Safety

The  most  heralded  detriment  of Montana's  Basic  Rule  is  the  law's  impact
on  roadway  safety.  As  noted  in Part  II.B  above,  while  the  numbers  are  less
than  conclusive,  it  seems  fair  to  characterize  Montana's  roads  as  somewhat
more  dangerous  under  the  Basic  Rule. 
Increased  speeds,  reckless  tourists
and  traffic  flow  disparities  appear  particularly  hazardous  under  the  new  law.
Admittedly,  the  evidence  is  ambiguous,  for  it  is  possible  to  claim  that  many
of the  accidents  and  deaths  occur  at  times  or  in zones  not  governed  under  the
Basic  Rule,  that  such  numbers  tend  to  fluctuate  from  year  to  year,  and  that
increased  seatbelt  usage  and  decreased  use  of  alcohol  could  have  dramati-
cally  increased  safety.  These  claims  undercut  the  most  alarmist  reading  of
the  data.  More  evidence  is  necessary  for  a  final  judgment;  currently,  it  ap-
pears  that  the  Basic  Law  has  decreased  safety  by  a  modest  but  non-trivial
amount.  On  the  whole,  safety,  while  the  most  significant  concern,  cannot
yet be  shown to  be  more  than a  slight  detriment  overall.

B.  Fuel Efficiency

Decreased  fuel  efficiency  represents  another  adverse  consequence  of the
Basic  Rule'  As  vehicle  speed  increases,  fuel  efficiency  decreases,  thereby
causing  motorists  to  spend  more  on  gasoline  and  consume  more  than  neces-
sary  of  a  non-replenishing  natural  resource.  The  Popular Mechanics re-

EXPENDITURES:  A  SPECIAL  ISSUE  OF  THE  JOURNAL  OF  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY  5  (W.  Kip
Viscusi  ed.,  1994)  (suggesting  risk-risk  analysis  as  a  replacement  for  cost-benefit  analy-
sis).

BOSTON UNIVERSITY  LAW REVIEW

[Vol.  79:155

porter  who  test  drove  the  Montana  minivan  throughout  the  state  provides  a
colorful  discussion  of the  decrease  in  fuel  efficiency  at  high  speeds,  writing,
"[b]ack  at  113  mph,  the  trip  computer  on  the  Trans Sport  [Montana  minivan]
says  we're  averaging  6  miles  per  gallon.  Right  there,  we  discover  the  first
drawback  of traveling-even  legally-at  such  high  speeds.  At  this  rate,  the
Trans  Sport's  24-gal.  tank  will  be  dusty  by  Tarkio,  about  125  miles  down  the
road."1 10  Conversely,  a  commercial  truck  driver  noted  the  economic  advan-
tage  of lower  speeds,  stating  that  on  his  trip  through  Montana  from  Vancou-
ver,  British  Columbia,  to  Hartford,  Connecticut,  "'[i]t's  about  a  thousand
bucks  in my  pocket  to  drive  slower."'  1I

Reasonable  questions,  however,  can  be  raised  about  the  fuel  efficiency  ar-
gument.  Obviously,  fuel  efficiency  alone  is  not  the  criterion  upon  which  to
establish  speed  limits;  if  it  were,  the  law  would  limit  vehicles  to  their  most
efficient  and  unrealistically  low  speeds  of 35  to  40 mph. 112  It is  also  possible
to  increase  fuel  efficiency  while  maintaining  a  relatively  high  speed  limit
through,  for  example,  higher  miles  per  gallon  or  using  light  rather  than
heavy  trucks. 1 3  Even  accounting  for  such  rebuttals,  however,  decreased
fuel  efficiency  looms  as  another  Basic  Rule  disadvantage.

C.  Air Pollution

Increased  air  pollution  is  another  adverse  effect  of  the  Basic  Rule.  Pre-
liminary  data  from  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  suggests  that
"rural  states  such  as  Montana,  which  have  sharply  raised  their  speed  limits
[although  the  increase  in  actual  speed  itself  is  slight],  face  a  higher  increase

110 Oldham,  supra note  69,  at  46.  The  reporter  also  admitted  that  at  the  vehicle's  top

speed  of  113  mph,  the  air  conditioner  ceased  functioning,  "turning  the  vehicle  into  the
fastest  greenhouse  on  the  face  of the  Earth."  Id.;  see  also Whitely,  supra note  21,  at  Al
("Speed  doesn't  come  without  cost.  Even  dropping  to 85  mph  on the  293-mile  drive  from
Ritzville,  Wash.  to  Missoula  [MT],  the  Explorer  got  24.01  miles  a gallon.  For  the  194-
mile high-speed  trip  from  Missoula  to Butte  and then  north  into Helena,  it  got  10.43  miles
a gallon.").

"13 A  reporter  for  the  Los  Angeles  Times colorfully  illustrates  the  point  that  vehicles'
lower fuel  economy,  rather  than  increased  speeds,  is the  real  culprit  in  the  decreased  fuel
efficiency  debate.

All of the  gasoline  saved  with  a lower  speed  limit  has been  more  than  consumed  by a
curious  development.  Our  fleet  mileage-the  collective  mpgs  of the  nation's  driv-
ers-has  dropped  dramatically  recently  because  of the  popularity  of light trucks  ....

in  ozone-forming  Nox  [oxides  of  nitrogen]  emissions." 114  The  EPA  survey
estimated  that  Montana  faced  a  12.74%  increase  in  ozone  forming  emis-
sions. 115  On the  other hand,  Montana  already  meets  the  national  primary  and
secondary  standards  for  ozone,  and  hence  the  increase  in  air  pollution  from
automobiles  does  not  appear  to  create  serious  risks of any  kind.  An official
from  the  Montana  Department  of Environmental  Quality,  Jim  Carlin,  found  a
negligible  impact  on  the  environment  of motorists'  higher  speeds."16  While
Mr.  Carlin  noted  elevated  levels  of  carbon  monoxide  around  Billings  and
Missoula  were  probably  attributable  to  increased  speeds,  he  characterized  the
practical  effect  of  such  speed-related  increases  in  air  pollution  as  "hardly
even  quantifiable;  they  [the  higher  levels  of emissions]  wouldn't  be  a  good
reason  to  debate  the  speed  limit  law."" T7  This  appears  to  be  a  plausible
view,  though  the  increased  pollution  certainly  counts  as  an  adverse  effect.

D.  Tourism

The  fact  that  Montana  operates  as  a  "speed  magnet"  is  not  only  a  nega-
tive;  perhaps  the  Basic  Rule  actually  helps  generate  more  tourism,  thereby
creating  various  positive  welfare  effects.  This  is  certainly  a  reasonable
judgment.  Nevertheless,  there  is  a  debate  about  whether  the  "reasonable  and
prudent"  standard  might  decrease  tourism,  another  potential  drawback." 8
Initially,  as  with  many  other  aspects  of  the  new  law,  Basic  Rule  opponents
made  alarmist  predictions,  forecasting  a  steep  drop  in  tourism,11 9 Montana's
second  largest  industry. 20  But  these  predictions  were  based  on  anecdotes,
not  evidence.  For  example,  the  Highway  Patrol  reported  that  "one  out-of-
state  woman  had  called  to  say  she  was canceling  her  vacation  for  safety  rea-
sons."' 2'  A  Maine  newspaper,  after observing  only  one  month under  the  Ba-
sic  Rule,  exhorted:

A  lot  of people  from  other  states  will  avoid  driving  through  Montana
now  that  they  know  some  of  the  barriers  are  down  against  extravagant
speeds  on  those  highways ....  Montana  is  right  to  be  worried  about

economic  detriment,  actually  might constitute  a  net advantage  under the  Basic  Rule.

how  people  will  view  a  state  with  its  speeders  unleashed.  That  gor-
geous  state  suddenly  looks  like  a place  to  visit some  other  year." 122
In  analyzing  a  potential  decrease  in  tourism,  the  Billings  Gazette  polled
travel  agents  in  New  York,  Washington,  D.C.,  Philadelphia  and  New  Jersey
to query  whether  vacationers  intended  to cancel  planned  trips  to  Montana.1 23
None  reported  any  cancellations. 124  Christopher  Reynolds,  a  Los  Angeles
Times  travel  writer,  concurred  that  the  spate  of  publicity  would  not  deter
tourists. 125  The  general  manager  of  one  of  Missoula's  newest  hotels  as-
serted,  "I think  the  speed  limit  [the  Basic  Rule]  will  bring  people  into  Mon-
tana." 126  An  official  from  Travel  Montana,  the  state's  tourism  agency,  con-
firmed  that  "there  is  no  indication  that  the  law  has  either  helped  or  hindered
tourism." 27  In  the  end,  speed  limits  seem  to  have  no  significant  effect  on
Montana's  robust  tourism  industry.  Any  decrease  from  frightened  motorists
has  probably  been  matched  by  those  seeking  a  state  without  numerical  speed
limits.

E.  Reputation

A  final  concern  to  Montana  under  the  Basic  Rule,  the  detriment  to  the
state's  reputation,  is  less  tangible.  Montana  has  endured  national  ridicule
and  derision  from  the  public  since  instituting  the  Basic  Rule.  Comedians
poked  fun  at  Montana  and  its  free-wheeling  spirit.128  Others  have  been  less
charitable.  National  Public  Radio's  "Car  Talk"  program  labeled  Montanans

"a  bunch  of morons."  129  Syndicated  columnist  Tony  Kornheiser  was  equally
condescending  in  his  description  of  Montanans,  quipping,  "[h]ave  you  seen
the  kind  of people  who  live  in  Montana?  Montanans  make  West  Virginians
look  like  it's opening  night  at  Lincoln  Center.  This  is  the  end  of  Montana  as
a  state  and  the  beginning  of Montana  as  a  test  track." 30  A  Highway  Patrol
officer lamented  that  the  Basic  Rule  "'[m]ade  us  the joke of the  nation.'"'13

Montanans  viewed  outsiders'  criticism  as  an  attack  on  their  state's  values
and  vehemently  defended  their  libertarian  ways.  Governor  Racicot's  Com-
munication  Director  bristled,  "'[tihe  tone  of  much  of  the  coverage  has  been
patronizing  at  best ....  And  I  understand  it.  Urban  Americans  can  be  un-
comfortable  if  they  don't  have  someone  else  telling  them  what  to  do." 1 32
One  resident  replying  to Kornheiser's  arrogant  missive  did  not  mince  words:
The  whole  thing  shakes  down  to a  simple  truth  about  how  we  do  things
here.  Our  legislature  made  a  law  reflecting  reality  instead  of prescrib-
ing  it.  We're  doing  just  fine  with  that,  thank  you,  we're  used  to  being

Despite  these  impassioned  rebuttals,  Montana's  image  emerged  a  bit battered
from  the  national  press  pounding.  On  the  whole,  however,  since  tourism
remains  unaffected  and  Montanans  themselves  shrug  off outsiders'  opinions,
the  eccentric  reputation  may  prove  a  source  of pride  for  the  state's  independ-
ent residents.

speeds.1 35  There  may  well  be  significant productivity  gains  from  time  saved.
Highway  Patrol  Sergeant  Robert  Koch  highlighted  the  economic  importance
of saving  time  on  the  roadways,  noting,  "'[w]e  have  a  lot of people  making  a
living  driving,  . . . and  they  are  appreciative  of the  fact  they  can  drive  70  or
even  80  miles  per  hour  on  the  interstate."" 136  Residents  also  favor  the  in-
creased  speeds  to  facilitate  weekly  errands  or  enhance  social  life.  137  The  in-
creased  speeds  can  result  in  substantial  time  savings. 
"A  car  going  65  mph
takes  more  than  10  hours  to cross  Montana.  Go  80  mph,  and  you  shave  off
two  hours." 138  Overall,  a  U.S.  News  &  World Report article  aptly  summa-
rized  the  productivity  argument,  stating,  "[fluel  efficiency  has  doubled  since
1974,  and  saving  a  few  bucks  on  a  long  trip  by  doing  65  vs.  75  is  hardly
compelling.  But  many  drivers  will  find  savings  of  an  hour  or  two  in  travel
time  quite  appealing." 1 39  It would  be  highly  desirable  to  quantify  the  various
savings  from these  efforts,  though  we  have  not been  able  to do  so here.

Interestingly,  Basic  Rule  supporters  also  claim  increased  safety  as  an  ad-
vantage  under  the  Basic  Rule.  Proponents  contend  that  prior  to  the  law,  the
majority  of  motorists did  not  obey  the  posted  speed  limits.1 40  Consequently,
advocates  argue,  drivers  who  adhered  to  the  mandated  levels  were  actually
dangerous,  disrupting  the  traffic  flow  by  traveling  significantly  slower  than
most  other  vehicles  on  the  road.141  Furthermore,  proponents  claim  that  the

135 Montana  Representative  Sonny  Hanson,  a  leading  Basic  Rule  advocate,  summarizes
the  arguments:  "The  reason  we  have  to  have  a  variable-type  speed  limit  is  because  of  the
size  of  the  state.  And  so,  we  really  need  a  daytime  speed  limit  that  reflects  the  distances

such  protracted  travel:  "'The  big  killer  out  here  is  falling  asleep  on  a

of the  'yee-hi!,'  dust-stirring  stagecoach  gallop,  and  it  is  fun." 148  Eliciting  a
wellspring  of public  support,  the  Basic  Rule  fosters  an  incalculable,  but  per-
haps  important,  advantage;  the  law  represents  an  extension  of  Montana's

IV.  LAW  ENFORCEMENT

A.  In  General

For  law  enforcement  officials,  the  Basic  Rule  is  both  a blessing  and  a  bur-
den.  The  highway  patrol  is  writing  considerably  more  speeding  tickets. 149
In  1995,  the  Highway  Patrol  issued  4,197  citations.  150  That  number  soared
to  6,825  in  1996,  but  declined  to  5,262  in  1997  as  people  became  accus-
tomed  to  the  law.' 5'  Since  fines  under  the  conservation  speed  limit  cost

148  Letts,  supra note  64,  at  9.
149  Ironically,  one  of  the  Highway  Patrol's  initial  arguments  against  the  Basic  Rule  was

a  predicted  decrease  in  speeding  infractions.  See  id.  at  9.  Law  enforcement  contended
that  such  traffic  stops  enabled  officers  to  detain  suspicious  drivers,  often  resulting  in  the
motorists'  arrests  for  other,  more  serious  crimes.  See  id.  ("Mr.  Wakefield  [a  Montana
Highway  Patrol  officer]  added  that  speed  offenses  used  to  allow  the  police  to  pull  over
shifty-looking  motorists.  He once  apprehended  a  gang  of armed  robbers  that  way.").  The
argument  implied  that  under  the  Basic  Rule,  officers  would  have  fewer  opportunities  to
stop  motorists  for  speeding,  thereby  depriving  police  of  the  opportunities  to  discover  and
arrest dangerous  offenders.  See  id.  Despite  the  dubious  constitutionality  of  such  a  tactic,
the  predictions  now  seem  inapposite:  the  Highway  Patrol  actually  issues  more  citations,
perhaps  increasing  the  chance  encounters.  See  Ann  Treneman,  Speed Is in  the Eye  of the

was  a  windfall  for  the  state  treasury.  State  revenues  increased  by  an  esti-
mated  $545,000  during  the  law's  first  year.154

Another  benefit  to law  enforcement  under  the  Basic  Rule  is  the  wellspring
of public  support  for  "reasonable  and  prudent"  driving.  For  example,  the
Montana  office  of the  American  Legion  reinstituted  its  custom  of commemo-
rating  fatal  crash  scenes  with  miniature  steel  crosses,  a  practice  which  it  had
not  undertaken  in  40  years. 155  In  addition  to  the  American  Legion's  efforts,
Montana  embarked  upon  a  major  advertising  campaign  to  inform  motorists
about  the  Basic  Rule  and  encourage  safe  driving. 156  Described  as  a  "public
information  blitz," 57 the  $20,000  campaign 158  intones,  "Whoa,  Dude,  there
is  a  Speed  Limit  in  Montana." 159  The  state  uses  a  variety  of mass  media  in
targeting  its  message  primarily  to non-Montanans.160

Despite  the  increased  revenues  and  enhanced  civic  support,  law  enforce-
ment  faces  significant  burdens  in  administering  the  Basic  Rule.  First,  offi-
cers  have  encountered  more  roadside  confrontations  with  motorists. 16 1  The
law's  subjective  nature  results  in  a  growing  number  of  "official-violator  re-

Second,  the  Basic  Rule's  mutable  standards  encourage  motorists  to  challenge
citations  in  court,  resulting  in  more  numerous  and  protracted  trials. 163  Con-
sequently,  law  enforcement  and  Montana's  legal  system  must  endure  a  del-
uge  of  Basic  Rule  cases.  The  Highway  Patrol  described  the  increasing
workload:

More  offenders  are  taking  basic  rule  violations  to  court.  Thus  officers
must  prepare  for  the  case  and  appear  in  court  for  these  challenges.  Be-
cause  of the  law's  subjectivity,  trials  involving  basic  rule  violations  tend
to  take  more  time.  Case  preparation  and  court  appearance  time  have
increased  by  614  hours  over the  previous  year  [1995].164

Montana's  Attorney  General,  Joseph  Mazurek,  derided  the  increase  in  court
time  and  costs,  emphasizing  the  detriment  to public  safety  by  decreasing  of-
ficers'  time  patrolling  the  highways. 65  Third,  the  increase  in  accidents  un-
der  the  Basic  Rule  resulted  in  a  further  drain  on  officials'  time.  Comparing
1995  to  1996,  officers  spent  an  additional  4,000  hours  in  1996  investigating
crash  sites,  a  9.6%  increase  from  1995.166  Fourth,  local  courts  appear  dou-

rule  means  that  drivers  do  not  know,  in  advance,  when  they  will  be  violating
the  law,  and  hence  there  is  a  risk  of lack  of fair  notice-a  point  we  take  up
below.

In  the  end,  law  enforcement  faces  a  dilemma.  On  the  one  hand,  the  in-
creased  revenues,  the  American  Legion's  efforts,  and  the  state's  advertising
campaign  facilitate  the  Highway  Patrol's  efforts  to  ensure  roadway  safety.

DOING WITHOUT SPEED LIMITS

In  opposition,  roadside  confrontations,  court  time,  legal  costs,  crash  investi-
gations  and  an  overburdened  judicial  system  make  enforcement  more  diffi-
cult.  Despite  the  augmented  revenues  and  moral  support,  it  appears  that  the
demands  of  apprehending,  investigating  and  prosecuting  Basic  Rule  viola-
tions  significantly  burdens  Montana's  thinly-staffed  Highway  Patrol.168

B.  Administering Standards

as 

"confusing," 169   "nebulous,"170 

The  most  difficult  challenge  under  the  Basic  Rule  is  establishing  workable
criteria  for  arrest  and  prosecution.  The  essential  problem  is  that  there  is  no
quantitative  basis  for  deciding  whether  a  motorist  has  violated  the  law.
"squishy," 17 1
Variously  described 
"vaguely  defined,"1 72  "arbitrary  and  inconsistent,"  173  and  "an  enforcement
nightmare," 1 74  administering  the  Basic  Rule  is  an  onerous  task  because  it  is
so  unclear.  Law  enforcement  officials  and  motorists  find  the  law  too  subjec-
tive,  hindering  both  drivers'  ability  to  comply  with  the  Basic  Rule  and  the
Highway  Patrol's  ability  to  deter  violators. 175  A  reporter  analogized  the  di-
lemma  to  asking  every  law  enforcement  official  "to  decide  how  many  drinks
each  driver  may  have,  based  on  body  weight  and  type,  before  becoming  too
drunk  to  drive."' 76  A  survey  of  what  speed  would  constitute  a  Basic  Rule
violation  revealed  the  considerable  disparity  in  estimates  on  the  subject. 177

168  However,  law  enforcement's  economic  and  temporal  strains  appear  less  a function  of

the  Basic  Rule and  more  a  result  of the  state's  budgetary  allocation.  See  supra Part  IV.A.
From  the  Basic  Rule's  expanding  revenue  figures,  it  seems  plausible  that  the  fines  could
ameliorate  the  law's  increased  costs  as  well  as  provide  for the  hiring  of  new  Highway  Pa-
trol  officers, judges  or court  personnel  to  meet  law  enforcement's  needs.

ficial  light,  or without  putting  it up  to your  face,  it's technically  still  daytime.").

Opinions  ranged  from  "'they'll  ticket you  if you  go  past  85,"'178 to  "'[b]reak

trolman's  assertion  that  "'in  my  opinion,  90  is  an  unsafe  speed  for  pretty
much  any conditions."" 180

Speeds  of more  than  100 mph  are  particularly  vexing  for law  enforcement.
Many  officers  state  the  refrain  that  "'[a]nything  in  triple  digits  is  probably  a
ticket," '" 8 1 defining  100  mph  as  "the  real  Montana  speed  limit." 82  But  oth-
ers  are  not  as  certain  that  the  100  mph  threshold  triggers  a  violation.  When
queried  whether  a  motorist  legally  could  drive  more  than  100  mph,  Major
Steve  Barry,  Deputy  Chief of Montana's  Highway  Patrol,  admitted,  "'I  can't
really  answer  that.""  83  Another  officer  acknowledged  that  he  would  be  dis-
inclined  to  stop  a  professional  driver  on  a  desolate  highway  at  speeds  in  ex-
cess of  100  mph. 184

Montana's  judiciary  also  is  reluctant  to  assign  a  fixed  numerical  speed
limit.  Some judges  impose  a  de  facto  85  mph  limit,  asserting,  "'[b]ring  that

contending  "there's  no  speed  that  would  necessarily  result  in  a  convic-
tion.  . . . 'Ninety-five  on  the  interstate  between  here  [Helena]  and  Billings

DOING WITHOUT SPEED LIMITS

Frustrated  by  the  lack  of  established  limits,  some  Highway  Patrol  officers
and  state  officials  resorted  to employing  non-numerical  guidelines  to  encour-
age  Basic  Rule  compliance.  One  Highway  Patrolman  exhorted,  "'Don't
drive  so  fast  you  can't  enjoy  the  scenery!" ' 8 8  Other  officers  emphasized
conformity  with  prevailing  traffic  patterns,  warning,  "'People  who  are  pass-
ing  everything-that's  the  type  of person  we're  going  to be  focusing  on." 1 89
Finally,  some  law  enforcement  officials  appealed  to  drivers'  caution,  im-
ploring  individuals  to  travel  "at  a  speed  that  would  be  comfortable  with  a
carload  of your children." 190

The  dearth  of consistent  standards  resulted  in arbitrary  and  ineffective  en-
forcement.  The  discretion  of  scores  of  officers,  prosecutors  and  judges
combined  with  the  numerous  Basic  Rule  conditions  concerning  weather,
roads,  and  vehicle  maintenance  fosters  inconsistency.' 9'  Additionally,  the
Highway  Patrol  asserts  that  the  Basic  Rule's  subjective  nature  hinders  en-
forcement  by  creating  longer  vehicle  stops  and 
increased  court  appear-
ances. 92  Consequently,  law  officers  spend  less  time  on  the  road, 193  and  the
roadside  stops  become  more  confrontational,  detracting  from  overall  safety
and  enforcement  efficiency.  94

A  recent  Park  County  case  involving  a  motorist  traveling  at  101  mph  il-
lustrates  the  debate  over  establishing  workable  standards.'95  A  district  court
jury  acquitted  the  driver  of any  Basic  Rule  violations.1 96  The  decision  in-
censed  law  enforcement  officials. 197 Highway  Patrol Chief Craig  Reap  stated
"'[i]f  someone  hits  your  car  at  101  mph,  wouldn't  you  be  outraged  to  hear
there's  no  violation?""' 98  The  Attorney  General  was  equally  indignant,  pro-
claiming  "if  being  caught  driving  101  mph  isn't  violating  the  basic  rule, ...
[I  don't]  know  what  [is]."1 9  The  defendant's  attorney  countered  that  the

the  deserted  road's  flat  surface  made  travel  at  101  mph  perfectly  reasonable
and  prudent. 2°°  The  attorney  dismissed  claims  that  the  law  was  confusing,
emphasizing  the  jury's  sound  judgment  in  considering  the  totality  of  the
driving  environment. 20 1

The  Basic  Rule  has  had  a  detrimental  effect  on  the  consistency  and  poten-
tially  the  overall  effectiveness  of  Montana's  law  enforcement.  Admittedly,
the  Basic  Rule  affords  ample  and  possibly  excessive  discretion.  However,
the  cause  of  the  "standards"  problem  emanates  not  only  from  the  law's
vagueness,  but  also  from  patrolmen'  and  judges'  variable  interpretations  of
the  Basic  Rule's  expressed  "reasonable  and  prudent"  standards.  Those  offi-
cers  and  judges  who  establish  their  own,  perhaps  idiosyncratic,  numerical
limits  and  uniformly  stop  or convict  defendants  under  fixed  guidelines  might
be  thought  to endanger  both  the  spirit  and  the  letter  of the  Basic  Rule,  in turn
creating  an  uncertain  patchwork  of  rule-free  and  rule-bound  law  enforce-
ment.  A  more  uniform  enforcement  process  might  have  reduced  this  prob-
lem.  Consequently,  the  Basic  Rule's  enforcement  problems  stem  partly  from
the  vagaries  of individual  assessments  and  multiple  conditions.  These  points
lead  naturally  to  the  question  of whether  the  Basic  Rule  compromises  values
associated  with the  rule of law.

C.  Rule of Law  Values

Drivers  face  numerous  opportunities  to either  comply  with  or  disobey  the
rule  of  law.  As  discussed  previously,  Montanans  routinely  ignored  prior
speed  limits,  causing  disrespect  for  the  law  and  demoralizing  the  officers
charged  with  enforcing  the  state's  statutes. 20 2  Furthermore,  some  officers
speculated  that  violation  of speed  limit  laws  lead  to  infractions  of other  ve-
hicular  offenses  and  a  general  deterioration  of rule  of law  values. 20 3  Speed

200  Id.  The  Highway  Patrol  disagreed  with  the  defense  attorney's  argument  that  the
driver's  background  as a  mechanic  ameliorated  the  Basic  Rule  violation:  "[O]ther  drivers
cannot  possibly  be  expected  to  factor  another  driver's  occupation  into  their decision  mak-
ing."  Montana  Highway  Patrol  Legislative  Handout,  supra  note  86.

people  hurt."'  Hardy,  supra note  112,  at  5  (quoting  Major  Steve  Barry,  Deputy  Chief of

limit  opponents  heralded  the  return  of the  Basic  Rule,  averring  that  the  new
law  would cease  turning  "law-abiding  citizens  into  scofflaws." 2°4

Rule  of law  values  also  suffer  under  the  Basic  Rule.  Anecdotal  evidence
suggests  that  the  Basic  Rule  also  gives  rise  to  additional  traffic  violations,
although  the  infractions  differ  from  those  arising  under  prior  speed  limits. 20 5
For  example,  officers  report  that  drivers  frequently  do  not  decelerate  when
leaving  the  interstates  and  entering  commercial  centers. 2°6  Law  enforcement
officials  from  neighboring  states  also  report  externalities. 
In  Idaho,  a  state
policeman  assigned  to patrol  the  Montana-Idaho  border  regularly  stops  driv-
ers  exceeding  90  mph. 20 7  The  Idaho  officer  notes  that  many  motorists  are
unaware  of  Idaho's  laws  or  are  simply  inattentive  to  their  vehicle's  speed,
despite  three  signs denoting  the  change  in state  speed  limits. 20 8

As  with  most effects  of the  Basic  Rule,  the  law's  effects  on  motorists'  rule
of  law  values  appears  inconclusive.  While  evidence  suggests  that  traffic
violations  that  are  not  related  to  speed  have  decreased,  other  speed-related
violations  are  on  the  rise. 2°9  Likewise, 
the  theory  that  motorists  are  no
longer  being  turned  into  "scofflaws"  is  countered  by  the  significant  increase
in citations  issued  under  the  Basic  Rule 210  and  by  the  externalities  reported  in
border  states. 211

V.  RECENT  LEGISLATIVE  ACTIONS  AND  POLITICAL  POLARIZATION
One  year  after  Montana  reinstituted  the  Basic  Rule  on  its  highways,  the
state's  Republican  Governor,  Marc  Racicot,  Democrat  Attorney  General,  Jo-
seph  Mazurek,  and  the  Highway  Patrol  led  a  campaign  to  reestablish  nu-
merical  speed  limits. 212  Citing  the  rising  number  of  accidents  and  interstate

fatalities,  the  speed  limits  coalition  proposed  a  daytime  speed  limit  of 75  mph
with  a  fine  of  $25  for  driving  10  mph  over  the  posted  limit  and  no  points
against  the  individual's  insurance  record. 2 13  Motorists  driving  more  than  10
mph  over  the  speed  limit  would  incur  additional  fines  and  have  the  infraction

State  Senator  Bill  Crippen  presented  the  coalition's  proposal  in  a  bill  in-
troduced  in  January  1997.215  The  legislation  faced  an  uphill  battle  from  the
outset.  Proposed  in  a  "legislature  [that]  has  a  long  history  of turning  down
proposals  to  increase  speeding  penalties," 216  the  bill  encountered  significant
opposition  and  was  defeated  on  a  procedural  vote  of 35  to  15.217  Although
Senator  Crippen  managed  to  revive  the  legislation  on  a  26  to  24  committee
vote  to  debate  the  issue  before  the  full  Senate,  218  the  bill's  prospects  seemed
bleak.

Opposing  lawmakers  asserted  that  the  public  did  not  support  altering  the
Basic  Rule.  Polls  showed  that  56%  of  Montanans  and  58%  of  legislators

opposed  numerical 
legislator  explained,
"'[p]eople  in  Montana  don't  feel  it's  necessary ....  We  drive  in  a  prudent
manner. 
I  went  door  to  door  during  the  election,  and  a  good  percentage
didn't think  government  had  any  business  interfering  in  how fast  people  want
to  drive."' 220  Other  speed  limit  detractors  echoed  the  dearth  of  public  sup-
port,  noting  that  "a  number  of  state  groups  representing  county  attorneys,
lower court judges  and  sheriff and  police  officers  didn't testify  at  the  hearing
because  they  declined  to  take  a  position  on  SB  64."221  Senator  Arnie  Mohl
summarized  the  opposition  position  best,  declaring  "'[t]he  public  don't  [sic]
want  a  speed  limit.  Let's  leave  it  lay."' 22 2  Opponents  ultimately  prevailed,
voting  down  the bill  41  to  8.223

In  September  of  1997,  several  state  legislators  renewed  calls  for  numerical

DOING WITHOUT SPEED LIMITS

State's  office  for  a  special  session  to  pass  speed  limit  legislation. 224  The
tenth  legislator's  request  on  September  4,  1997  triggered  a  mail  canvass  of
lawmakers;  proponents  needed  a  majority  of  76  votes  to  convene  the  legis-
lature. 225  Speed  limit  proponents  again  cited  mounting  highway  fatalities  as
justification  for  numerical  limits. 226   An  impassioned 
legislator  decried,
."'[o]ur  friends  and  neighbors  are  dying  out there.'

227

Opponents  rejected  the  link  between  the  Basic  Rule  and  fatalities.  One
lawmaker  observed  that  "many  of  the  deaths  have  involved  alcohol  or  the
failure  to  use  seat belts,  and  that  many  have  occurred  at  night,  when  a  speed
limit  is  in  effect. "228  Given  the  legislature's  historic  dislike  of speed  limits,
S.B.  64's  resounding  defeat,  and  the  overall  lack  of public  support,  it  ap-
peared  unlikely  lawmakers  would  vote  to  convene  the  legislature. 229  These
predictions  came  true  as  speed  limit  proponents  lost  their  bid  to  reconvene
the  legislature  by  a lopsided  vote  of 110  to  38.230

The  political  polarization  the  speed  limit  issue  engenders  is  the  most  inter-
esting  aspect  of recent  legislative  actions.  Although  polls  show  that  Monta-
nans  are  roughly  evenly  split  on  the  speed  limits  question,  significant  differ-
ences  of  opinion  exist  by  geographic  region,  gender  and  age.  For  example,
residents  of Montana's  more  rural  eastern  and  central  regions  favor  the  Basic
Rule  to shorten  the  time  required  to  travel  the  long  distances  between  the  ar-
eas'  isolated  communities. 231  City  residents  tend to  favor  numerical  limits. 232

230  See  Western Empire,  supra  note  225.  The  defeat  may  be  attributed  to  the  cost  of

Gender  and  age  are  even  more  indicative  of individuals'  preferences  in the
speed  limits  debate.  When  residents  were  asked  whether  they  "would  favor
or  oppose  having  the  Legislature  enact  a  specific,  daytime  speed  limit,"  re-
spondents  split  almost  evenly  on  the  question,  with  48%  in  favor  and  45%

women  favored  the  legislation  by  an  even  wider  69%  to  25%  margin. 235

surveys,  men  between  the  ages  of  18  and  30  were  the  strongest  Basic  Rule
advocates,  while  women  over  63  were  the  leading  supporters  of numerical
limits. 237

The  recent  legislative  actions  exemplify  Montana's  factionalized  opinion
on  the  speed  limits  issue.  Yet  despite  the  clamor  over  increased  highway
fatalities  and  the  role  of excess  speed  in  such  accidents,  until  Montanans  de-
velop  a  consensus  bridging  geography,  gender,  and  age,  a  legislative  altera-
tion  of the  Basic  Rule  seems unlikely.

VI.  VOID  FOR  VAGUENESS?

In  late  1998,  a  sharply  divided  Montana  Supreme  Court  invalidated  the
daytime  speed  limit  as  unconstitutionally  vague. 238  The  case  involved  a  de-
fendant  who  had  been  doing  a  steady  85  miles  per  hour. 239  In  a  brief  opin-
ion,  the  Court  concluded  that  the  Basic  Rule  did  not  give  the  defendant
"reasonable  notice  of  the  speed  at  which  his  conduct  would  violate  the
law." 240  Neither  the  arresting  officer  nor  the  Attorney  General  was  able  to
specify  a  speed  that  would  have  been  reasonable  for  the  defendant. 24 1  The

DOING WITHOUT SPEED LIMITS

Court  emphasized  that  the  law  enforcement  machinery  of  the  state  had  not
attempted  to  limit  the  discretion  of police  officers  through  guidelines,  and
that  it  had  relied  instead  on  individual,  case-by-case  judgments. 242  Thus  "the
average  motorist  in Montana  would  have  no  idea  of the  speed  at  which  he  or
she  could  operate  his  or  her  motor  vehicle  .... 
Furthermore,  the  basic  rule
not  only  permits,  but  requires  the  kind  of  arbitrary  and  discriminatory  en-
forcement  that  the  due process  clause  in  general,  and  the  void-for-vagueness
doctrine  in  particular,  are  designed  to prevent,"  largely  because  it  delegates
"basic  public  policy"  to  police  officers,  judges,  and  juries. 243  A  dissenting
opinion  by  Justice  Regnier  emphasized 
the  defendant  had  been
"[o]perating  a  vehicle  at  85  miles  per  hour  on  a  two-lane  highway  with  frost
heaves,  steep  hills,  and  curves,  where  farm  vehicles  may  unexpectedly  ap-
pear." 244  Thus  Justice  Regnier's  suggestion  appeared  to  be  that  the  defen-
dant  in  the  case  could  not  reasonably  claim to  have  lacked  notice  that  he  was
violating  the  law. 245

that 

The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  principally  empirical,  and  thus  we  do  not
venture  a  detailed  discussion  of  the  Court's  ruling  under  the  due  process
clause.  But  what  we  have  said  here  offers  some  lessons  about  the  need  for
empirically-informed  constitutional  law. 
It  is  difficult  for  a  court  to  venture
a judgment  about  vagueness  without  knowing  how  a  law  operates  in practice.
A  law  that  seems  vague  may  be  far  less  so when  taken  in  the  context  of pub-
lic  and  private  practices.  Note.  for  example,  that  on  the  day  after  it  invali-
dated  the  Basic  Rule,  the  Montana  Supreme  Court  upheld  the  prohibition  on
"reckless  driving,"  notwithstanding 
the  apparently  unclear  definition  of
"reckless  driving"  as  operating  "any  vehicle  in  willful  or  wanton  disregard
for  the  safety  of persons  or property." 246  The  constitutional  question  is  what
legal  terms  are  taken  to  mean,  by  public  and  private  actors,  and  a  seemingly
open-ended  term  may  be  proved  far  less  open-ended  by practice.

The  evidence  that  we  have  discussed  does  provide  considerable  support
for  the  Court's  ruling.  As  we  have  seen,  diverse  law  enforcement  officials
interpret  the  basic  law  in  diverse  ways,  and  motorists  cannot  always  know,
with  precision  and  in  advance,  how  much  speed  is  excessive.  The  strongest
opinion  for  invalidation  might  have  been  empirical,  emphasizing  the  unmis-
takable  record  of uncertainty  and  arbitrariness.

We  think,  however,  that  it  was  probably  premature  for  the  Court  to  in-
validate  the  law.  There  is  some  evidence  of  an  increasing  degree  of  clarity
about the  circumstances  in  which drivers  will  be  found  to  violate  the  law.  At
the  very  least,  there  seems  to  have  been  an  emerging  judgment  about  what

cumstances.

It  remains  to  be  seen  how  Montana  will  respond  to  the  ruling  of  its  Su-
preme  Court.  A  revised  version  of the  Basic  Rule  might  attempt  to  provide

Court  was  obviously  troubled  by  the  failure  of law  enforcement  to  provide
greater  clarity  for  the  driving  public.  On  the  basis  of the  evidence  discussed
here,  we  believe  that  it  is  legitimate  to  ask  for  greater  guidance  for  rule  of
law  purposes.  But  in  a case  in  which  the  largest  issues  might  best have  been
left  undecided,  the  Court  may  well  have  invalidated  the  Basic  Rule  prema-
turely,  at  least  in the  absence  of a  more  detailed  factual  report.

CONCLUSION

Montana's  Basic  Rule  appears  to  be  a  simple  proposition:  During  daytime
hours  on  the  state's  highways  and  interstates,  motorists  must  drive  in  a
"reasonable  and  prudent"  manner.  Yet  the  Rule's  impact  on  America's

Enacted  in  accordance  with  Montana's  libertarian  principles, 

the  Basic
Rule  drew  national  attention  but  caused  no  substantial  difference  in  Monta-
nans'  driving  habits  in the  short  term.  Although  the  average  speed  increased
by  a  non-trivial  amount  from  72  mph  to  78  mph,  most  Montanans  continued
driving  at  approximately  the  same  speed.  While  remaining  within  historical
fluctuation  ranges,  the  state's  total  fatalities  decreased  during  1996,  soared  in
1997,  and  declined  again  in  1998;  it  remains  unclear  if this  variation  is  at-
tributable  to the  change  in law  or to  some  other  factor  or  set  of factors.  The
underlying  lesson  appears  to  be  that  driving  habits  are  only  partly  a  function
of law.  Probably  the  most  discernible  effect  of  the  Rule  is  that  Montana  has

DOING WITHOUT SPEED LIMITS

Enforcement  is  perhaps  the  biggest  problem  with  the  Basic  Rule.  Al-
though  ticket  revenues  have  increased,  roadside  confrontations,  accident  in-
vestigations  and  court  appearances  also  have  increased,  depleting  the  already
scant  resources  of the  Highway  Patrol  and  judiciary.  Furthermore,  the  sub-
jective  standard  has  proven  an onerous  task to  administer.  Arbitrary  and  in-
consistent  enforcement  by  the  police,  prosecutors,  and  judges  impedes  citi-
the  law's  effectiveness. 
zens'  compliance  and 
to
reinstate  a  numerical  speed  limit  have  failed  amidst geographic,  age  and  gen-
der  factionalization.  However,  in  late  1998,  a  sharply  divided  Montana  Su-
preme  Court  invalidated  the  daytime  speed  limit  as  unconstitutionally  vague,
a  move  we  have  criticized  in  light  of  the  insufficient  factual  record  of the
case.

Legislative  attempts 

A  more  consistent  application  of  the  law  might  have  reduced  some  of
these  problems  and  may  have  prevented,  or  at  least  forestalled,  the  recent
Montana  Supreme  Court's  action.  Recent  evidence  of  declining  roadway
fatalities  and  Basic  Rule  citations  may  indicate  that  drivers  were  adapting  to
the  flexible  standard.  Furthermore,  as  Montanans,  tourists,  the  Highway
Patrol,  prosecutors  and judges  became  more  accustomed  to  "reasonable  and
prudent"  travel,  a  consensus  might  have  emerged,  reducing  the  difficulty  of
establishing  workable  standards  for law  enforcement  and the judiciary.

An overall  evaluation  of the  law  and  its  consequences  would  require  more
time  and  data.  Even  at  this early  date  the  transition  from  the  55  mph  limit to
the  Basic  Rule  offers  some  significant  lessons. 
It  highlights  the  important
role  that  social  norms  play  in  generating  driving  behavior. 
It  reveals  how  a
state  may  become  a  speed  magnet  or  a  speed  repellent. 
It  also  illustrates  the
need  to assess  a number  of effects  in order  to  evaluate  a  change  in transpor-
tation  policy.  Finally,  the  study  demonstrates  the  palpable  adverse  effects  of
a  vague,  highly  subjective  standard  on  law  enforcement.  These  lessons  do
not  permit  any  simple  or straightforward  verdict  on  the  Basic  Rule.  But  they
do  bear  on  a  number  of recurrent  debates  in  private  and  public  law,  most
notably  the  choice  between  rules  and  standards,  and  the  relationship  between
law  and  social  norms.
