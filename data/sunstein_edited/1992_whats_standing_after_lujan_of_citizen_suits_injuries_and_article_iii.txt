INTRODUCTION

In  1983,  Judge  Antonin  Scalia,  of the  U.S.  Court  of Appeals  for
the  District  of Columbia  Circuit,  published  a  dramatic  and  provoca-
tive essay  on  the law  of standing.  The  thesis  can be found in the title:
The Doctrine of Standing As An  Essential Element of the Separation of
Powers. I Only  recently  named  a judge, and having taught administra-
tive  and  constitutional  law  for many  years,  Judge  Scalia  called  for  a
significant  shift  in the law  of standing.

Judge  Scalia's argument hinged on  a distinction between two kinds
of cases.  "[W]hen  an individual  who  is  the very  object of a  law's  re-
quirement  or  prohibition  seeks  to  challenge  it, he  always  has  stand-
ing."'2  But  standing  should  frequently  be  unavailable  when  "the
plaintiff  is  complaining  of an  agency's  unlawful  failure to  impose  a
requirement  or  prohibition  upon  someone else." 3  In  the  latter  case,
Judge Scalia  contended that there was a serious interference  with exec-
utive  power.  Judge  Scalia  concluded  that in  cases  of the latter  sort,
courts  should  hold  that  Article  III  imposes  "a  limit  upon  even  the
power  of  Congress 
legal
rights .... -"4 The  Court  had not  addressed  this  important  and  long-
disputed  issue  before.

shifts the law of standing.  The opinion hinges on a distinction between
two kinds  of cases.  "When... the plaintiff is himself an object of the
action  (or forgone  action)  at  issue  ... 
there  is  ordinarily  little  ques-
tion" that he has standing. 6  "When,  however,  ...  a plaintiff's asserted
injury  arises  from  the government's  allegedly  unlawful  regulation  (or
lack  of  regulation)  of someone else,  much  more  is needed."' 7  In the
latter  case,  there  is  the  risk  of  serious  interference  with  executive
power, in the form  of a  "transfer  from the President  to  the courts"  of
"the  Chief  Executive's  most  important  constitutional  duty,  to  'take
Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.'  "8' Through Justice Scalia's
opinion,  the  Court  held  that  Article  III  required  invalidation  of an
explicit  congressional  grant of standing to  "citizens." 9  The  Court had
not  answered  this question  before.10

Lujan may well be one  of the most important standing cases  since
World  War  II.  Read  for  all  it  is  worth,  the  decision  invalidates  the
large  number  of statutes  in  which Congress  has  attempted to  use the
"citizen-suit"  device  as a mechanism  for  controlling unlawfully inade-
quate enforcement  of the law.' 
Indeed, the decision  ranks among the
most important in history in terms of the sheer number  of federal  stat-
utes that it apparently has invalidated.12  The citizen  suit has become a
staple  of federal environmental  law  in particular:  nearly  every  major
environmental  statute provides for citizen  standing.13  The place of the

10.  The  apparently  unanimous  view  of lower courts had been  that a legislative  grant of citi-
zen  standing  was  constitutional  even  without  a  showing  of injury  in  fact.  See,  eg.,  Evans  v.
Lynn,  537  F.2d 571  (2d Cir.  1976);  Friends of the Earth  v.  Carey,  535  F.2d  165  (2d Cir.  1976);

citizen  in environmental  and regulatory  law has  now been  drawn  into
sharp  question.

But the importance  of Lujan does not lie  only in the invalidation  of
the  citizen  suit.  The  decision  revises  the law  of  standing  in  several
other ways  as well.  And it raises  a host of new  puzzles  for later cases
to solve.

In this  article,  I have  two  principal  goals.  The  first  is  to  explain
why Lujan's invalidation  of a congressional  grant of standing is a mis-
interpretation  of the Constitution.  It is  now  apparently  the  law that
Article  III  forbids  Congress  from  granting  standing  to  "citizens"  to
bring  suit.  But  this  view,  building  on  an  unfortunate  innovation  in
standing law by Justice William 0.  Douglas,14 is surprisingly  novel.  It
has  no support  in the text or history  of Article III.  It is essentially  an
invention  of  federal  judges,  and  recent  ones  at  that.  Certainly  it
should  not  be accepted  by judges  who  are  sincerely  committed  to  the
original  understanding  of the  Constitution  and  to  judicial  restraint.
Nor should  it be accepted  by judges  who  have different  approaches  to
constitutional  interpretation.

Lujan holds that the requirement of an "injury  in fact" is  a limita-
tion  on congressional  power;  but an  "injury  in fact,"  as the Court un-
derstands  it,  is  neither  a  necessary  nor  a  sufficient  condition  for
standing.  The  relevant  question  is  instead  whether  the  law  -
gov-
erning  statutes,  the Constitution,  or federal  common  law -
has  con-
ferred  on the plaintiffs  a  cause  of action. 15  An  inquiry into  "injury  in

14.  See the discussion  of Association of Data Processing  Serv.  Orgs.  v. Camp,  397  U.S.  150

(1970),  infra notes  102-13  and accompanying  text.

15.  In an  often-quoted  phrase,  Justice Douglas wrote  that  "[g]eneralizations  about standing
to sue  are largely  worthless  as such."  Association of Data Processing  Serv.  Orgs.  v. Camp,  397
U.S.  150,  151  (1970).  If the analysis  here is correct, this  generalization  is  indeed  largely  worth-
less;  but one  generalization  -
that the  standing issue  depends  on  the  existence  of a  cause  of
action -
is not.  This  approach  to  the  question  of standing  is also  set  out  in  Lee  A.  Albert,
Standing to  Challenge Administrative Action:  An Inadequate Surrogate for Claim for Relief, 83
YALE  L.J. 425,451-55  (1974);  David  P. Currie, Misunderstanding Standing, 1981  Sup. Cr. REV.
41;  William A. Fletcher, The Structure of Standing, 98  YALE L.J  221  (1988);  David  A.  Logan,
Standing to Sue:  A  Proposed Separation of Powers Analysis,  1984  Wis.  L.  REv.  37;  Cass  R.
Sunstein, Standing and the Privatization of Public Law, 88 COLUM.  L.  REv. 1432  (1988).  In  a
similar  vein,  see  Richard  H.  Fallon,  Of Justiciability, Remedies,  and Public Law Litigation, 59
N.Y.U. L.  REv.  1 (1984).  Many authorities to the same effect  are collected in Fletcher, supra, at
223  n.18.

The  courts  have  shown  a discernible  trend in this  direction.  See Air  Courier Conference  of
America v.  American  Postal  Workers  Union,  111  S. Ct.  913 (1991);  Lujan  v.  National  Wildlife
Fedn., 497 U.S.  871  (1990);  Block v. Community Nutrition Inst., 467  U.S.  340 (1984).  Of course
one could conclude  that Article  III imposes limits on Congress'  power to grant standing but that,
short of those limits, the standing question  is whether  Congress  or any  other source  of law con-
fers a cause of action.  Perhaps the law will tend in this direction  even post-Lujan.  See especially
International  Primate Protection  League  v.  Administrators  of Tulane  Educ.  Fund,  111  S. Ct.
1700  (1991),  where  the Court  said  that "standing  is  gauged  by  the specific common  law, statu-
tory or constitutional  claims that a party presents,"  and noted  that standing  "should  be seen as a

November  1992]

fact"  will  both  allow  standing  where  it  should  be  denied  and  deny
standing where  it  should  be granted.

More  fundamentally,  the  very  notion  of  "injury  in  fact"  is  not
merely a misinterpretation  of the Administrative  Procedure  Act 16 and
Article  III but  also a large-scale  conceptual  mistake.  I hope  to  show
that the injury-in-fact  requirement  should be  counted  as  a prominent
contemporary  version  of early  twentieth-century  substantive  due  pro-
cess.  It uses highly  contestable  ideas  about political  theory  to invali-
date congressional  enactments,  even though the relevant constitutional
text  and  history  do  not  call  for invalidation  at  all.  Just like  its  early
twentieth-century  predecessor,  it injects  common  law  conceptions  of
harm  into  the Constitution.  Moreover,  it  acts  as  if injury  can  be  as-
sessed through a purely factual inquiry, rather than one that is inevita-
bly a product  of courts'  value-laden  judgments  and of governing  legal
conventions.  This deep  problem  has  been  obscured  by  the surprising
evolution  of modem  standing  principles.

My second goal is to  discuss the many  new issues that will arise in
the  aftermath  of Lujan.  Under  what  circumstances  can  citizens  now
prove  that  they  are  not  mere  citizens,  but  people  with  the  requisite
"injury"  or  "personal  stake"?  How  does Lujan affect  environmental
and  other  regulatory  cases?  What  might  Congress  do  to  respond  to
the decision?  These will be the key questions in the next decade.  They
will have considerable importance  for the development  of environmen-
tal  law and  risk regulation,  and indeed  for administrative  and regula-
tory  law  in general.

This article  is  divided  into  three  Parts.  Part  I briefly  sets  out the
history  of the law  of standing.  Here  I discuss the clear  acceptance  of
"stranger"  or  "citizen"  suits at  the founding  period  in both  England
and  early  America.  The  Lujan Court  should  not  have  taken  the ex-
traordinary step of invalidating  a congressional  grant of standing with-
out  investigating  the  relevant  history.

I also describe  the very  recent creation  of the "injury-in-fact"  test.
I will  show  that,  in  an  exceedingly  short period,  a  revisionist  view  of
Article III, with no textual  or historical support, has established injury
in  fact  as  a  constitutional  prerequisite.  I  also  argue  that,  despite  its
apparent  simplicity,  the notion  of injury  in  fact  is  heavily  dependent
on  an assessment  of law  and is  far from  a law-free  inquiry  into  facts.
Part  II  describes  and  evaluates  the various  holdings  in  the Lujan

question of substantive law,  answerable by reference  to the statutory and constitutional  provision
whose  protection  is  invoked."  111  S.  CL  at  1704  (citing Fletcher, supra, at 229).

case.  I end the Part with two brief detours:  a discussion  of the role of
the citizen  suit in  regulatory  law  and  a general  assessment  of Justice
Scalia's  conception  of Article  III,  as  set  out  in his  1983  Suffolk  Law
Review  article.  The  overlap  between  the  1992 Lujan opinion  and the
1983  article is sharp  and clear.  The  overlap makes the article a matter
of considerable  current  interest.

Part  III discusses  the future of the law  of standing  in  the  wake  of
Lujan.  Here  I  try to  show  exactly  which  issues  are  open  and  which
closed.  One of my major purposes is  to explore  the effect  of Lujan on
current  regulatory  cases  brought  by  beneficiaries. of  regulatory  stat-
utes.  I argue  that in many  such  cases  standing  remains available,  but
that some cases  brought by  consumers and  others are now  drawn  into
sharp  question.

In order  to  overcome  some  of the uncertainties  now facing  citizen
suits, I recommend  that Congress  create a system of bounties  for citi-
zens  in  cases  involving  both  private  defendants  and  the  executive
branch.  Even  after  Lujan,  such  a  system  should  raise  no  constitu-
tional  question.  Congress  may  also  have  the  power  both  to  create
property  rights  in  the benefits  provided  by  regulatory  statutes  and to
establish  standing to  vindicate those  property  rights.  I conclude  with
a discussion  of this intriguing  possibility.

I.  A  CAPSULE  HISTORY  OF  STANDING

The  law  of standing  has  had  many  remarkable  twists  and  turns.
For convenience, we might think  of American law as evolving  through
five different  eras of standing doctrine.  We are now in the midst of the
fifth; its contours  remain indistinct.  But one of its principal  features is
an  insistence  that  Article  III  requires  injury  in  fact,  causation,  and
requirements  unknown to our law until the  1970s.  In
redressability  -
this Part,  I outline  the  development  of standing  doctrine. 17

It makes sense  to  begin with the text  of Article III, which  extends
"Judicial  Power"  to  certain  specified  "Cases"  and  "Controversies." 18
In the original understanding,  "cases"  included both civil and criminal
disputes,  whereas  "controversies"  were limited to  civil disputes. 19  Ar-
ticle  III  contains  no explicit  constitutional  requirement  of "standing"
or "personal  stake."  Nor does it ever refer to  "injury  in fact."  It does
require a case  or controversy,  and very  plausibly there is no such thing

without  a  cause  of action. 20  If we are  to  impose  additional  standing
requirements,  we  must  do  so  on  the basis  not of text but  of history,
both before  and at the time of the framing  and through judicial prac-
tice  over  time.2 1

An overview  of opinions  addressing  the issue  of standing  will help
illustrate  the  basic  picture.  In  the  history  of  the  Supreme  Court,
standing has been discussed  in terms of Article III on  117 occasions. 22
Of those  117  occasions,  55, or nearly  half, of the discussions  occurred
that is, in the past seven years.  Of those  117,  71,  or over
after  1985  -
that  is,  in just
two  thirds,  of the  discussions  occurred  after  1980  -
over  a decade.  Of those  117,  109,  or nearly  all,  of the discussions  oc-
curred  since  1965.  The first reference  to  "standing"  as  an Article  III
limitation  can be  found in Stark v.  Wickard,2 3 decided  in  1944.  The
next reference  does not appear until eight years later, in Adler v. Board
of Education.24  Not  until  the  Data Processing case  in  197025  did  a
large  number  of cases  emerge  on  the issue of standing.  The explosion
of judicial  interest in  standing as a distinct body  of constitutional  law
is  an  extraordinarily  recent  phenomenon. 26

What  of "injury  in fact"?  No  court  referred  to  this phrase  before
Barlow v.  Collins 27  in  1970.  After  that  year,  the  phrase  appears  in
about ten  cases  during  each  succeeding  five-year  interval,  until a leap
to  ten  references  in  the brief  period  from  1990  to  1992.28  Thus  the

26.  This  evidence  is  crude because  it  is  consistent  with  two speculations.  (a)  Perhaps  the
recency  of the particular  words  obscures  the tradition  represented  by  the general  concept.  (b)
Perhaps  standing  has  become  important  only  recently  as  a  result  of attempts to  bring  suit  by
people  who  would  never  even  thought  of doing  so  before.  If (a) is  true,  the  evidence  tells  us
nothing.  If (b)  is  true, the constitutional  limit was  always  present  but did not  have  to be often
invoked  until recently.

The discussion in  Part I should shed  light on these possibilities.  For the moment, a few  brief
words.  The history suggests  that (a) is  only partly true.  A  cause of action has  traditionally  been
required,  and  this requirement  is indeed  imposed  by Article  III.  But standing, as a distinct body
of law,  represents  a genuinely  new  development,  not a  traditional  one.  As  Part  I also  suggests,
(b)  is  only partly true as well.  Stranger or citizen  actions  are  familiar  to English  and American
law.  The suit to compel nondiscretionary  government action is no innovation; it is part of the old
idea  of mandamus.  On  the other  hand,  the  modem regulatory  state has  furnished  many  more
occasions  for  this  suit than was  traditional.

injury-in-fact  test played  no  role  in  administrative  and constitutional
law  until the past  quarter  century.

To  say this  is  not to  deny  that there  were  important  antecedents
for the requirement  of standing.  As we will soon see, there had always
been  a  question  whether  the plaintiff  had  a cause  of action,  and  this
was  indeed a matter  having constitutional  status.  Without  a  cause  of
action,  there  was no  case  or controversy  and hence no  standing.  This
is  an  extremely  important  principle.  Moreover,  a handful  of cases  in
the  1920s  and  1930s relied  on notions  of "standing"  without  mention-
ing the word.  These  cases,  too, are  of considerable  importance.  But
we will see  that the modem  understanding  of standing is  insufficiently
self-conscious  of its  own  novelty,  even  of its revisionism.

A.  English and American Practice
The first period, by far the longest, ranges  from the founding era to
roughly  1920.  In that period, there was no  separate  standing doctrine
at  all.29  No  one  believed  that  the  Constitution  limited  Congress'
power  to  confer  a cause  of action.  Instead,  what  we now  consider  to
be  the question  of standing  was  answered  by  deciding  whether  Con-
gress  or  any  other  source  of law  had  granted  the plaintiff  a  right  to
sue. 30  To  have  standing,  a litigant  needed  a  legal  right  to bring  suit.
The  notion  of  injury  in  fact  did  not  appear  in  this  period.  The
existence  of  a  concrete,  personal  interest,  or  an  injury  in  fact,  was
neither  a  necessary  nor  a  sufficient  condition  for  a  legal  proceeding.
People with a concrete interest could not bring suit unless the common
law, or  some other  source  of law, said  so.  But if a source  of law  con-
ferred  a  right  to  sue,  "standing"  existed,  entirely  independently  of
"concrete  interest"  or  "injury  in  fact."' 31

Implicit  in  these  ideas  was  a  particular  conception  of Article  III
and a particular understanding  of the relationship  between Article III
and standing.  If neither  Congress nor the common law  had conferred
a right  to  sue,  no  case  or  controversy  existed.  Whatever  harm  had
occurred was not legally  cognizable  at all;  this was a  case  of damnum

29.  Much  of the relevant  history emerges from three important  essays:  Raoul Berger, Stand-
ing to Sue in Public Actions:  Is It  a Constitutional Requirement?, 78 YALE L.J.  816 (1969);  Louis

to  his  Article  III  caveats,  in  his  1983  article:  "Standing  requires  ... 
the  allegation  of some
particularized  injury to the individual  plaintiff.  But legal  injury is by definition  no more  than the
violation of a legal  right;  and legal  rights  can be created by  the legislature."  Scalia,  supra note  1,

absque injuria.  Courts  had  no  power  to  hear  the  plaintiff's  claim.
There was  therefore  a sharp  distinction between  an  injury  on  the one
hand  (a  "harm")  and  a  legal  injury  on  the other.  To this  extent,  the
Article  III requirement  of a case  or controversy  did  indeed constrain
the category  of persons  who  could bring suit.  But the constraint had
everything  to  do  with whether the legislature  or some  other source  of
law had created  a cause of action.  It had nothing to do with "injury in
fact."

There  is no  evidence  of constitutional  limits on  the power to  grant
standing.  In both  England  and  America,  actions  by strangers,  or  by
citizens  in  general,  were  fully  permissible  and indeed  familiar.  There
is  no  basis  for the view that the  English  and  early  American  concep-
tion  of adjudication  forbade  suits  by  strangers  or citizens.

1.  England

The practice in England  is revealing, for it helps  cast light on what
the  founding  generation  may  have  understood  by  "case  or  contro-
versy."  Before  and  at  the time  of the  framing,  the  English  practice
was  to  allow  strangers  to  have  standing  in  the many  cases  involving
the ancient  prerogative  writs.  Of these  writs, two  of the most impor-
tant  were  certiorari  and  prohibition.  "The  English  tradition  of locus
standi in  prohibition  and  certiorari  is  that  'a  stranger'  has  standing,
but  relief in  suits by  strangers  is  discretionary." '3 2

The governing idea behind the writ of prohibition  was that a usur-
pation of jurisdiction  encroached on  the royal prerogative.  It followed
that  anyone  could  bring  the writ.33  A  key  case  was Articuloi Cler,
reported  by  Coke  in  a passage  that would  have  been  familiar to  the
Americans  of the late eighteenth  century.3 4  The central  passage  says:
"And  the kings  courts  that  may  award  prohibitions,  being  informed
either  by  the  parties  themselves,  or  by  any stranger, that  any  court
temporall  or eclesiasticall  doth hold  plea of that (whereof they have
not jurisdiction)  may  lawfully  prohibit the same  ... 
,,a3  No  English
court  appears  to have  rejected the view that prohibition was  available
at the behest  of strangers.3 6

The  writ  of certiorari  was  similarly  available  to  citizens,  and  not
just those  with a  concrete  or  personal  interest.  A  case  in  1724  indi-

cated  that "one  who  comes  merely  as  a stranger"  was  entitled to  dis-
cretionary  judicial  relief.37  Suits  by  strangers  were  also  permitted
under  a statute allowing  an  information  of quo  warranto.38  An  Eng-
lish  case  expressly  so  held  in  the auspicious  year  of  1789.39

There  were  other  English  precedents  for  the  citizen  suit.  In  the
seventeenth  and eighteenth centuries, mandamus  was available in Eng-
land, even  at the behest  of strangers. 40  Thus  Berger  writes:

From such cases  a colonial  lawyer  might well  have concluded  that man-
damus  was  capable  of issuance  at the  suit  of a stranger  who  sought  to
assert the public interest, especially because  the analogy  of mandamus  to
prohibition  was  early  drawn, and  because  Coke,  who  had unequivocally
stated  the  availability  of prohibition  to  strangers,  also  made  a  massive
assertion  of mandamus jurisdiction. 4 1

The  mandamus  action  is  closely  related  to  the  modem  citizen  suit.
The  purpose  of  the  mandamus  action  is  to  require  the  executive
branch to do  what the law  requires it to do.  This is the same idea that
underlies  the  citizen  suit,  most  conspicuously  in  the  environmental
area.

Related devices in England were the informers' action and the rela-
tor action.  In  the  informers'  action,  cash  bounties  were  awarded  to
strangers  who  successfully  prosecuted  illegal  conduct.  In  relator  ac-
tions,  suits  would  be  brought  formally  in  the name  of the Attorney
General,  but  at  the  instance  of  a  private  person,  often  a  stranger.
"[A]ny  persons,  though  the most remote  in the  contemplation  of the
charity,  may  be  relators  ... 
."42  Certiorari  and  prohibition  remain
available  to  strangers  in  England  today.43

The  English  history is  sufficient  to show  that  if we are thinking  in
historical terms,  "the  argument  for a constitutional bar  to strangers  as
complainants  against  unconstitutional  action"  is  "without  founda-
tion."44  The  modem  injury-in-fact  test,  developed  in  the  twentieth
century,  attempted  to  draw  on  the  Westminster  practice.45  But

enough  has been  said  to show  that  this is a historical blunder.

2.  America, the  Qui Tam Action,  and Others

There is  relatively  little  explicit material  on the  Framers'  concep-
tion of "case  or controversy." 46  Certainly  there  is  no direct  evidence
that injury  in  fact  or concrete  interest  was  intended  to be  a  constitu-
tional prerequisite  under Article  III.  There is no  reason  to  think that
the  Framers  sought  to  limit  Congress'  power  to  create  "cases"  or
"controversies"  by conferring  causes  of action.4 7  To understand what
the Americans  understood,  it is useful  to  consult the early  American
practice, looking  at the state  and  federal  levels.

If we look  at the practice in  state  courts, we will find no  reason  to
think  that  the  American  practice  was  more  restrictive  than  that  in
England.  Several  state  cases  built  explicitly  on  the English  practice.
For example, a South Carolina  court issued a writ of prohibition at the
behest of a stranger.48  A  New Jersey  case in  1794 established  stranger
jurisdiction  in  certiorari,  effectively  allowing  a  citizen  action. 49  An-
other New  Jersey case  issued a  writ of certiorari  on behalf of a citizen
and  expressly  rejected  the view  that the  "court  ought not  to award  a
certiorari on the mere prayer of an individual, unless he will previously
lay  some  cause  before  them  tending  to  show  that he is  or may be af-
fected  by  the operation  of the by-law  ....

Other  cases  in the first century  of the republic  suggested  the same
view. 5 1  Thus  Louis  Jaffe  summarized  his  historical  survey  with  the

suggestion  that  "the  public  action -
an  action  brought  by  a private
person  primarily to vindicate  the public interest in the enforcement  of
public obligations -
has long been a feature of our English  and Amer-
ican  law."'52

At the national  level,  there  is  no  clear  American tradition  of reli-
ance  on  the prerogative  writs.  According  to  the Supreme  Court's  in-
terpretation  of the All  Writs Act, 53  Congress did not choose  explicitly
to  create  general  mandamus,  prohibition,  or  certiorari  jurisdiction,
though  there were  particular  statutory and  common  law cases  involv-
ing the writs,  and it seems  clear that their limited  use was a matter  of
legislative  discretion  rather  than  constitutional  command. 54  There
are, however,  revealing  early  precedents  for the citizen  suit at the na-
tional level.  The writ  of prohibition to restrain  an allegedly  unconsti-
tutional  tax  was  treated  as  a constitutional  case  in  a  relatively  early
decision  of the Marshall  Court, 55  and  in  1875  the Supreme  Court al-
lowed  a petition  for mandamus  at the behest  of what it treated  as  citi-
zens.  In  Union Pacific Railroad v. Hall,56 merchants  brought  suit  to
require  a federally  chartered railroad  to create  a  certain railroad  line.
They invoked  a general  mandamus  statute "to  compel  the  Union Pa-
cific  Railroad Company to operate  its road as required by law."'57  The
Court  said  that the merchants  were  attempting  to  enforce  "a  duty to
the public generally"  and that they "had no interest other than  such as
belonged  to  others."' 58  Nonetheless,  the  Supreme  Court  allowed  the
action  to go  forward.

Moreover,  the  early  Congress  was  active  as  well.  I  believe  that
the qui  tam  action  and  the  in-
that  operate  as  a  powerful  affirmative  argument

Congress  supplied  two  precedents  -

against  the view  that Article  III  bars  "stranger"  or  "citizen"  actions
once  these  have been  congressionally  authorized.

The  most  important  development  was  the  widespread  early  con-
gressional creation  of the qui tam action.  The purpose of this action is
to  give citizens a right to bring civil suits to help  in the enforcement  of
the federal  criminal  law.  Under  the qui tam  action, a citizen  - who
is permitted to bring suits against offenders
might well be a stranger -
of the law.  Qui tam  actions  are  familiar to  American  law.  "Statutes
providing  for actions  by  a common  informer,  who  himself has  no  in-
terest  whatever  in  the  controversy  other  than  that  given  by  statute,
have  been  in existence  for  hundreds  of years  in  England,  and in  this
country  ever  since the foundation  of our Government." 59  In the first
decade of the nation's existence,  Congress  created a number of qui tam
actions. 6°  Explicit qui tam  provisions  were  allowed  under  many stat-
utes, including those criminalizing the import of liquor without paying
duties, 6 1 prohibiting  certain  trade  with  Indian  tribes, 62  criminalizing
failure to comply with certain postal requirements, 63 and criminalizing
slave  trade with foreign  nations."

The  qui  tam  action  was  accompanied  by  the  informers'  action.
Through  this  action,  people  can  bring  suit  to  enforce  public  duties;
successful  plaintiffs  keep a share of the resulting  damages  or fines.  In
the states, this action had become familiar in the early  stages of Amer-
ican history.  Notably, the informers'  action was available  against both
private  defendants  and public  officials. 65  Early  Congresses  created  at
least two informers'  actions to assist in the enforcement  of federal law.
The  first  of  these  operated  not  only  against  private  violators  but
against  executive  officials  as  well. 66  "Suits  by  those  without personal
injury  who were  acting as representatives  of others were not viewed  as
raising  constitutional  problems  under  article  III.1167

no evidence  that anyone at the time  of the framing believed that a qui
tam action  or informers'  action  produced  a constitutional  doubt.  No
one  thought  to  suggest  that  the  "case  or  controversy"  requirement
placed serious constraints  on  what was, in essence,  a  citizen  suit.  This
fact provides  extremely  powerful  evidence  that Article  III did not im-
pose  constraints  on Congress'  power  to  grant  standing  to  strangers.

There are two possible differences  between the qui tam and inform-
ers'  actions  on the one hand  and the modem  citizen  suit on the other.
First, the former  are usually  brought  against  a  private defendant.  By
contrast, the government  is often  the defendant  in  the  citizen  suit,  as
indeed it was in Lujan itself.  If the requirement  of injury is to  be read
in light of constitutional  provisions relating to  executive  power,68 then
the existence  of the qui tam and informers'  actions may not be decisive
as against  the claim  that citizen  or  stranger  suits  are  constitutionally
forbidden.

Second,  the  victor in  a  qui tam  action is  ordinarily  entitled to  re-
cover  money to  be paid  to  himself,  to  the United  States,  or  to  both.
The victor in an  informers'  action also receives  some financial  benefit.
By contrast, the victor in a citizen action does not recover money.  For
this reason  it is  not completely  odd  to  think that,  as  originally  under-
stood, the Constitution  permitted stranger  actions only if dollars were
to  change  hands.

These  are not  entirely  implausible distinctions.  But if they are  set
out as part of an argument that Article III forbids the citizen  suit, they
do  make  for  quite  a  stretch.  Most  important,  the  informers'  action
was  available  against  public  as well  as  private defendants  at the state
and  federal  levels.  It  cannot  be  distinguished  on  the  ground  that it
operated  only  against  private  defendants.  Nor  should  it  matter  that
money does not change hands.  The history suggests that the bounty is
designed  to  offer  an  incentive,  not to  create  an  injury  where  none ex-
isted before.  A declaratory judgment  or an injunction serves  the same
purposes as a victorious  suit in a qui tam or informers'  action.  Indeed,
mandamus  suits did  not involve  money  at  all, and  these  too were  ac-
cepted  during  the early  period. 69

More  generally,  if the  stranger  suit  was  thought  constitutionally
problematic, in all probability some  constitutional concern would have
been  voiced  about  the  qui tam  action  or  the  informers'  action.  The
absence  of any  concern  about these  actions  makes  it  exceedingly  un-
likely  that the case  or  controversy  requirement  was  believed  to  place

any  constraints  on  Congress'  ability  to  grant  causes  of  action  to
strangers. 70

The  Constitution  may require  courts to  impose greater  constraints
on standing when the executive is the defendant.71  But if an "injury in
fact"  is  required  by  Article  III,  it  should  not  matter  a  great  deal
whether  the  defendant  is  public  or  private.  Hence  the  qui  tam  and
informers'  actions  do  seem  to  be powerful  evidence  against  the claim
that  an injury  in  fact  is  an Article  III  requirement.

3.  Summary

The  discussion  thus  far has  shown  that early  English  and Ameri-
can  practices  give no  support to  the view  that the Constitution limits
Congress'  power to create standing.  The relevant practices suggest not
that everyone  has standing, nor that Article  III allows  standing for all
injuries, but instead something far simpler and less exotic:  people have
standing if the law has  granted them  a right to  bring suit.  There is  no
authority  to  the contrary  before  the twentieth  century,  and, indeed,  I
think that there  is  no  such  authority  before  World  War  11.72

A general  picture emerges  from  the words of the great administra-
tive law teacher  Frank Goodnow,  writing in  1905.  Goodnow's  exten-
sive  treatise has no discussion  of standing, then  a foreign  concept;  but
it does  deal with  the prerogative  writs  in  America.  Describing  what
had  come  to  be the American  practice,  Goodnow  wrote:

The  purpose  of the  writs  is  twofold.  In the  first  place,  they  are  issued
mainly  with  the  intention  of  protecting  private  rights;  in  the  second
place,  some  of them  may be  made  use  of  also  for  the  purpose  of  the
maintenance  of the  law  regardless of the fact whether in  the particular
case a private right is attacked or not  Thus in the case of the certiorari it
has been held that this writ may not be made use of simply for the main-
tenance  of the  law,  that  no  one  may  apply  for  it unless  he  has  some
particular interest  in its issue which is  greater than that possessed by  the
ordinary  citizen.  The  courts, however, have held with regard to  the quo
warranto  that it may be  issued on the demand of any citizen of responsi-
bility; and the better rule would seem to be  that in matters of public con-
cern any citizen or taxpayer may apply for the mandamus.73
In  this light,  is  it  even  possible  to  argue  that the  case  or  contro-
versy  requirement  forbids  the  citizen  action?  Perhaps  the  English
cases  are  not decisive,  since  the case-or-controversy  requirement  was

not present in English  law.  That requirement  might even  be seen as  a
check  on  certain  suits  cognizable  in  England.  Nor  is  the American
practice  completely  unambiguous.  The  prerogative  writs  were  not
generally available  at the behest  of strangers in  the federal  courts.  As
noted, the qui tam action operated against private persons, and money
would  always  change hands.  It might therefore  remain possible to  ar-
gue that Article III indeed requires  a "personal  stake"  or an "injury  in
fact"  because, in  the United  States,  federal  courts  were  not tradition-
ally given jurisdiction  in pure  citizen  suits.

The  history  does  not  completely  foreclose  this  argument,  but  it
does  make  the argument  seem  far-fetched.  There  is  absolutely  no af-
firmative  evidence  that Article  III was intended  to limit congressional
power  to  create  standing.  There  is  no  affirmative  evidence  of a  re-
quirement  of a  "personal  stake"  or an  "injury  in  fact"  -
beyond the
genuine  requirement  that some source  of law  confer a  cause  of action.
Nor is there reason to believe that the case-or-controversy  requirement
was  designed  to  draw sharper  limits than existed  in English  law.  The
general  unavailability  of the prerogative  writs  in  federal  court  was  a
matter  of legislative  discretion,  not  constitutional  compulsion. 74  It is
at the very least highly suggestive  that no one seemed  to think that the
qui tam or informers'  action raised an Article  III issue.  In light of all
this, the claim that Article  III bars  citizen  standing  -
once Congress
has  created  it  -

seems  most adventurous  as  a  matter  of history.

It would  be  possible  to  respond  that  particular  historical  under-
standings  are not always  binding in constitutional  law.  Segregation  is
unconstitutional  even  if the framers  did  not  intend  to  abolish  it;75  in
the Due Process  Clause, the meaning  of "liberty"  changes  over  time;76
the  Contracts  Clause  has  been  understood  to  be  far  narrower  than
originally  conceived. 77  Perhaps Article III  should be treated the same
way;  perhaps  we should  not be bound  by the framers'  particular  con-
ception  of its  meaning.

The  general  point  about  constitutional  interpretation  seems  cor-
rect, but it does not justify the view that Article III prohibits Congress
from  granting  standing to  citizens.  When  the specific  understandings
are  not  binding, it  is  because  the framers  are  taken  to  have  set out  a
general  principle  capable of change over time, or because changed  cir-
cumstances  call  for a departure  from  historically  specific  understand-

ings.78  In  Article  III, the general principle  is  that a case  cannot  exist
unless  some source  of law  creates  a cause of action.  It is hard  to un-
derstand  why  this principle  should  be  abandoned  in  the  context  of a
citizen  suit.79

B.  The Initial Appearance of "Standing"  The Progressive
and New Deal Periods

The second stage of standing law occurred in the early parts of this
century.  It was  here that  "standing"  began to  make  a modest  initial
emergence  as a discrete body of doctrine.  To understand this develop-
ment,  a little background  is  in  order.

The  preliminary  development  of standing  doctrine  should  be  un-
derstood  as  part  and  parcel  of the  heated  struggle,  in  the  1920s  and
1930s, within the country  and the courts about the constitutional  legit-
imacy of the emerging  regulatory state.  Courts frequently  invoked the
Constitution  as  a  barrier  to  regulatory  law.80  Justices  Brandeis  and
Frankfurter  were,  in their  somewhat  different  periods,  the leading  ex-
ponents  of the view that courts  should defer to the outcomes of demo-
cratic processes.

In this  light, it should come as no  surprise that the principal  early
architects  of what we now consider  standing limits were Justices Bran-
deis  and  Frankfurter. 8'  Their  goal  was  to  insulate  progressive  and
New  Deal  legislation  from  frequent  judicial  attack.  Attempting  to
counter the aggressive  Supreme  Court  of the period, Justices  Brandeis
and  Frankfurter  helped  develop  a  range  of devices  designed  to  limit
the  occasions  for judicial  intervention  into  democratic  processes.

78.  Brown exemplifies  both these  points.  See Brown,  347  U.S.  at 483.
79.  I do not contend  that there are no limits to Congress' power to decide  what is a  "case" or
"controversy."  In all  likelihood,  for example,  Congress  is barred  from  overcoming  the ban  on
advisory  opinions.  See  GEOFFREY R.  STONE  ET AL.,  CONSTITUTIONAL  LAW  86  (2d ed.  1991).
This ban  is a plausible  inference from  the "Opinions  in Writing"  Clause, which  allows  the Presi-
dent  to require opinions  from  heads  of departments,  but not from judges.  U.S.  CONsT.  art. II,
§ 2,  cl. 1.  Moreover,  the  notion  of a  "case,"  as  historically  understood,  excludes  the judicial
provision  of advice  at the behest  of public officials.  Outside of the distinctive  area  of standing,
then, there  are barriers  to Congress'  power to create a "case"  where  one did not exist  before.  In
very  rare  cases,  there may  even be barriers  to the congressional  conferral  of standing for separa-
tion-of-powers  reasons.  Consider, for example,  a grant of standing to all members of Congress  to
challenge  all executive  action.  I do not deal with such  exotic examples here.  See also Hayburn's
Case, 2  U.S.  (2  Dall.)  409 (1792)  (refusing to adjudicate  case where judicial  decision is subject  to
executive  suspension  and  legislative  revision).

nection  between the New  Deal and the development  of standing doctrine is traced  in illuminating
detail  in Winter, supra note  22, at  1452-57,  and  briefly  discussed  in Sunstein,  supra note  15,  at

In  the key  cases,  they  repudiated  constitutional  attacks  on  legisla-
tive  and  administrative  action  by  invoking  justiciability  doctrines.8 2
Prominent  among  these  doctrines  was  the  requirement  of  what  we
now  think  of as  standing.8 3  The  crucial  cases  involved  efforts  by  citi-
zens  at large  to  invoke  the Constitution  to invalidate  democratic  out-
comes.8 4  In  such  cases,  the  Court  held  that  there  was  no  personal
stake  for the invocation  of judicial power.

How  are we to  understand these  cases?  We  might begin by  asking
whether  there  was  any  source  of a cause  of action.  In  each  case,  no
common law right was  at stake.  In addition,  no statute created  a right
to  bring suit.  Finally, it seemed implausible  to suggest,  in these cases,
that the relevant  constitutional provision  created  a private right of ac-
tion.  The  very notion  that private  rights  of action -
could  be created  by  constitutional  provisions  was many  years  away.8 5
Even if some constitutional provisions  created  private rights, it seemed
hard  to  accept  the view  that provisions  in  these  cases  did  so, because
the relevant  duties could not be individuated  and seemed  to run to the
public  at  large.  I take  up  this matter  below. 86

or standing  -

The  development  of standing  limitations  in  the  early  part  of the
twentieth  century  was  indeed a  novelty,  in  the sense  that no  separate
body of standing law existed  before this period.  Notably,  the relevant
opinions  did not even  refer  to  the word standing.  But we might  well
see  the  Brandeis-Frankfurter  innovations  as  broadly  compatible  with
preexisting law.  For the most part, their opinions  can be read to hold
that no one has a right  to sue unless some law has  conferred  a  right to
do  so.  In  the cases  in  which the  cause  of action was  denied,  no  such
right  had  been  conferred.  This  was  the  key  point  in  the  relevant
opinions. 87

power which ...  is  novel and extraordinary").  It is especially  notable  that Justice Brandeis'  great
opinion  in Ashwander -
the modem source ofjusticiability doctrine -
does not refer  to Article
III  at all.  See  Winter, supra note  22,  at 1424.

Standing After  Lujan

As  noted  above,  the requirement  of a cause  of action  is  indeed  a
command both  of Article  III  and of tradition.""  The  relevant  denials
of standing were therefore properly based on the plaintiffs'  inability  to
find a law  that  entitled  them  to  sue.  Thus  the Supreme  Court  could
write  as  late  as  1939  that,  to  have  standing,  a plaintiff  must  have  a
"legal  right -
one  of property,  one  arising  out of contract,  one  pro-
tected  against  tortious  invasion,  or  one  founded  on  a  statute  which
confers  a privilege."8 9

C.  The Administrative Procedure Act

The  third  period  in  the  development  of standing  consists  of  the
enactment  and  interpretation  of  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act
(APA)  in  1946.90  The relevant  provision  of the APA  was  an effort  to
codify  the  developing  body  of judge-made  standing  law:  "A  person
suffering legal wrong because of agency  action, or adversely affected  or
aggrieved by agency  action within the meaning  of a relevant  statute,  is
entitled  to judicial  review  thereof." 91  This apparently  cryptic  phrase
was  actually  designed  to  recognize  standing  in  three  straightforward
categories  of cases.  All  three  categories  had  become  well-established
under  previous  law.92

First, people could  obtain standing by showing that they suffered  a
"legal  wrong"  because a common law  interest was  at stake.  An inva-
sion  of  a  common  law  interest  would  certainly  qualify  as  a  legal
wrong.  Courts presumed  that anyone  who  could  show  such  an inva-
sion would be entitled to bring suit.  This idea had constitutional  foun-
dations,  to  the  extent  that  a  foreclosure  of standing  to  people  with
common  law  interests  might  raise  problems  under  the  Due  Process
Clause  or Article  III. 93

Second,  plaintiffs  could  show  that  they  suffered  a  legal  wrong
within  the meaning  of APA  by demonstrating  that their statutory in-

terests were  at stake.  For  example, if the interest of a litigant  in com-
petition  on  equal  terms  was  a  relevant  factor  under  the  governing
if the agency  was  required  to  take  that factor  into account
statute  -
the litigant would  have  standing to bring suit to  vindicate its inter-
-
est.  Congress need not have expressly  conferred  standing on the plain-
tiff;  under  the  APA,  the  mere  existence  of  an  interest  protected  by
statute was sufficient. 94  The APA's framers  paid little attention  to the
question  how far this  approach would  extend standing  to beneficiaries
and  competitors,  though  it seems  clear  that standing  was  not  merely
contemplated  for objects. 95

The third category did not involve legal  wrong at all.  People could
a  statute
bring  suit  if they  could  show  that  "a  relevant  statute"  -
other than  the APA  -
granted  them  standing by  providing that peo-
ple  "adversely  affected  or  aggrieved"  were  entitled  to  bring  suit.  In
this  way,  the  APA  recognized  that  Congress  had  allowed  people  to
have  causes  of action,  and hence  standing, even  if their interests  were
not  entitled  to  consideration  by  the  relevant  agency.  Such  people
could  act  as  "private  attorneys  general."  This  had  already  occurred
under  the  Federal  Communications  Act.9 6  The  APA  thus  provided
for  congressional  authorization  of  actions  by  people  lacking  legal
injuries.

This,  then,  was  the APA  framework:  standing  for people  whose
common law  or statutory interests  were  at stake, as  well  as for  people
expressly  authorized  to  bring  suit under  statutes  other than  the  APA.
Under the APA, there  was considerable  continuity  with previous law,
in the sense  that the principal  question,  for purposes  of standing,  was
whether  the  law had  conferred  a cause  of action.  Injury  in  fact  was
neither  a necessary  nor  a  sufficient  element.

94.  See The  Chicago Junction  Case,  264 U.S.  258,  266-69  (1924);  SENATE  COMM.  ON  THE
JUDICIARY,  ADMINISTRATIVE  PROCEDURE  ACT:  LEGISLATIVE  HISTORY,  S.  Doc.  No.  248,
79th Cong.,  2d Sess. 276  (1946):  "The phrase  'legal wrong'...  means  that something  more than
mere adverse personal  effect  must be shown  in  order to prevail  -
that is, that  the adverse effect
must be  an illegal  effect."

I will  not discuss  here the question how  to interpret statutes that are ambiguous on the exist-
ence of a  private  cause  of action.  For present  purposes,  the key  point  is  that the APA  did  not
require an explicit  grant, but instead inferred a cause of action (standing) from the existence  of an
interest that  the  agency  was  entitled  to consider.

Standing After  Lujan

D.  From "'Legal Injury" to  "Injury in Fact"

The fourth stage of standing law spanned from the early  1960s un-

til  about  1975.  It included  several  dramatic  new  departures.

1.  Beneficiary Suits

including beneficiaries  of regulatory programs -

The  shift in  this  fourth period  began  when  courts  interpreted  the
"legal wrong"  test to allow  many  people affected  by  government  deci-
sions -
to bring suit
to challenge  government  action.  For example,  courts  concluded  that
displaced  urban  residents, listeners  of radio  stations,  and users  of the
environment  could  proceed  against  the  government  to  redress  an
agency's  legally  insufficient  regulatory  protection. 97  To  understand
these  developments,  a little background  is  again  in  order.

In  the  1960s  and  1970s,  observers  of regulatory  law  claimed  that
congressional  purposes  could be  undermined  not  merely by  excessive
regulation,  but  also  by  insufficient  regulation  or  agency  hostility  to
statutory  programs. 98  If conformity  to  law  was  a goal of administra-
tive law,  there  was  no reason  to distinguish  between  the beneficiaries
and the objects of regulation.  Suits brought by beneficiaries  might well
serve  to  promote  agency  fidelity  to legislative  enactments.

In the same period,  there was  also  a good  deal  of empirical  litera-
ture  suggesting  that  agencies  were  sometimes  subject  to  sustained

97.  See Norwalk  CORE  v. Norwalk  Redev.  Agency,  395  F.2d  920,  932-37  (2d  Cir. 1968);
Office of Communication  of the United Church  of Christ  v. FCC, 359  F.2d 994,  1000-06  (D.C.
Cir.  1967);  Scenic Hudson  Preservation  Conf. v. FPC, 354 F.2d 608,  615-17  (2d Cir.  1965),  cert
denied, 384 U.S.  941  (1966).  Then-Judge  Burger  wrote, in  an influential  passage:

The theory that the [FCC] can always effectively  represent the listener interests in a renewal
proceeding  without the aid and  participation  of legitimate  listener  representatives  fulfilling
the role of private attorneys general  is one  of those assumptions  we collectively  try to work
with so long as  they are  reasonably  adequate.  When  it becomes clear,  as it does  to us now,
that it is  no longer  a valid  assumption which  stands  up under the realities of actual  experi-
ence, neither we nor the Commission can continue to rely on it.  The gradual  expansion and
evolution of concepts  of standing  in administrative  law attests  that experience  rather  than
logic  or fixed  rules  has been  accepted  as  the guide.

United Church of Christ, 359  F.2d at  1003-04.

The  general idea  that courts might review  unlawful inaction was  hardly inconsistent  with the
APA as originally  understood.  See U.S.  ATrORNEY  GENERAL'S  COMMITrEE ON  ADMINISTRA-
"IVE PROCEDURE,  ADMINISTRATIVE  PROCEDURE IN  GOVERNMENT  AGENCIES,  S.  Doc.  No.  8,
77th Cong.,  1st Sess.  (1941):

.

[T.he  problem  of whether  the  administrator's  refusal  to  take  action  is  reviewable  still  re-
mains.  .
In  some  instances  review  may  be  unavailing  because  the  determination  of
whether or not action should be taken in  the circumstances  may  have been committed  to the
exclusive judgment of the administrator  as to the public interest and  convenience.  But ifthe
denial is based on an erroneous interpretation of law, judicial review  is available to remove at
least that barrier.

political pressure  from  regulated  industries.99  The result  was  agency
"capture."  Through  this  process,  statutory  enactments  could  be de-
feated during implementation, principally  as  a result of the continuous
exercise  of  power  by  well-organized  private  groups,  or  "factions."
Collective  action  problems  faced  by the often-diffuse  members  of the
beneficiary  class  made  it hard for them to  exert  the same kind of con-
tinuous influence  on government.  Just as unorganized  interests  would
be  at  a  systemic  disadvantage  in  economic  ordering,  so  they  would
face  serious  problems  in  the  political  process.  Government  failure
would  therefore  mimic market  failure.

This account  was extremely  influential  in the  1960s and  1970s,  and
it has continuing  popularity today. 100  But it should  not be overdrawn.
The  empirical  literature  did  not establish  a systemic  risk  of adminis-
trative abdication,  and it did not demonstrate  that regulated industries
are  always  in  a  better  position  to  influence  government  than  benefi-
ciaries.  Sometimes  the  opposite  seemed  true. 10 1  But  the  empirical
literature  was  sufficient  to  cast into  severe  doubt  the  idea that regula-
tory  objects,  and  not  beneficiaries,  should  have  access  to judicial  re-
view.  That  idea  seemed  to  stem  from  partisan  considerations  or
judicial  hostility  to  regulatory  programs  enacted  by  Congress;  it  did
not appear  to  have any better  pedigree.  In view  of the empirical  evi-
dence,  it seemed  positively  perverse  to  grant  standing  to  objects  and
not to beneficiaries.  Thus  it was  that the legal injury  test  came,  quite
naturally  and plausibly,  to be read to  allow  standing for beneficiaries,
who  often faced statutory harm -
by virtue of inade-
quate regulatory  action.

"legal  injury"  -

These  modest  expansions  in  standing  were  entirely  compatible
with  the  language  and  framework  of  the  APA.  They  built  on  the
"legal  wrong"  idea to  grant  standing  to many  individuals  and  groups
intended  to  be benefited  by  statutory  enactments.  It was  fully  reason-
able to  think that the beneficiaries  of regulation suffered  a  legal injury
when  government  failed  to  protect  their  legal  interests.  But  a  huge

Standing After  Lujan

and far  less justified  conceptual  break occurred  in  Justice William  0.
Douglas'  opinion for the Court in Association of Data Processing Orga-
nizations v.  Camp, 0 2  which provides  the basic  underpinnings  for  the
modem law  of standing.  In Data Processing, the Court  essentially jet-
tisoned  the entire  framework  of the APA,  even  as  it purported  to  in-
terpret that  very  statute.

In  a  remarkably  sloppy  opinion,  the Data Processing Court  con-
cluded  that a  plaintiff no  longer  needed  to  show  a  "legal  interest"  or
"legal  injury"  to  establish  standing.  That  test  "goes  to  the  merits.
The question of standing is different."10 3  Instead  of a careful examina-
tion  of the governing law  to  see  if Congress  had  created  a legal  inter-
est,  the  standing inquiry  would  be  a  simple  one  barely  related  to  the
underlying law.  Henceforth  the issue would turn on  facts, not on law.
In  the new  test,  standing  existed  for  anyone  who  could  show  (a)
"injury  in fact, economic or otherwise"'1   and (b)  injury "arguably...
within the zone of interests" 10 5 of the regulatory statute.  The zone-of-
interests  test was  intended  to be  exceptionally  lenient 10 6 and for pres-
ent  purposes may  be put to  one side. 10 7  The result of Data Processing
was  thus  an  entirely  new  focus  for determining  the  class  of persons
entitled  to  bring  suit.  The  Court  appeared  fully  to  endorse  the  1960s
expansions  in the legal  interest test;  under its new  test, beneficiaries  of
regulatory  programs  would  generally  have  standing.  But  they  no
longer  were  required  to  show  any  legal  interest.  Instead  they had  to
show  an injury  in fact.

One might well ask:  What  was the source  of the injury-in-fact test?
Did  the  Supreme  Court  just  make  it  up?  The  answer  is  basically
yes.10 8  The  concept of "injury in fact"  first arose in a 1958  treatise by

102.  397  U.S.  150  (1970).
103.  397 U.S.  at  153.
104.  397 U.S.  at  152.
105.  397 U.S.  at  156.
106.  See Data Processing, 397 U.S.  at  154-55  (noting  instances  where standing  exists).
107.  There has,  however, been  a recent  rebirth in  the zone-of-interests  test -

unintended  in
Data Processing, but perhaps  presaging  a partial  return  to the legal  interest  test.  Thus the first
Supreme Court case denying standing  on zone-of-interest  grounds came in  1991.  See Air Courier
Conference  of Am. v.  American  Postal  Workers Union,  111  S. Ct.  913  (1991).  If the analysis  in
this essay  is  right,  this development  should  be enthusiastically  welcomed  as a  return  to the cor-
rect understanding  of the APA  and Article  III.

108.  Here  I agree  entirely  with  Justice Scalia.  See  Scalia,  supra note  1, at  887-89.  Others
have also  rejected  the  conclusion  that the APA requires  an  injury in  fact.  The  most famous is
Louis L.  Jafie, Standing Again, 84 HARV.  L. REV. 633,  636 (1971);  see also Fletcher, supra note

Data Processing than to any other  single decision.");  Richard  Stewart, Standingfor Solidarity,  88

disaster").

Kenneth  Culp  Davis,  purporting  to interpret  the Administrative  Pro-
cedure  Act. 0 9  Davis  relied  on the  APA's  "adversely  affected  or  ag-
grieved"  language in support  of this  conclusion.  In his view,  someone
is  "adversely  affected"  if he  suffers  an  injury  "in  fact." 110

For reasons  set forth above, this was a misreading of the APA;  the
language  and  history  of that statute  suggested  no  such  renovation  of
standing law."'  The words  "adversely  affected  or aggrieved"  are  not
freestanding,  but  are  followed  by  "within  the  meaning  of a  relevant
statute."  This  juxtaposition  shows  that  Congress  was  thinking  of
other  laws  that  created  private  attorneys  general.1 1 2  But  Davis'  mis-
reading  received  an  authoritative  endorsement  in  Data Processing.
The  Court's opinion  was  opaque  on the connection  between  injury in
fact  and Article  III.  The  test seemed  to  stem  from the APA,  but  the
opinion  can  be  read  to  suggest  that  Article  III  is  also  highly
relevant. 113

2.  Conceptual Confusion, the New Deal, and the
Metaphysics of "Injury"

Data Processing was poorly written, because it left obscure the rela-
tionship  between  standing  and  Article  III,  and  more  fundamentally
because it did not explain  the legal source  of its novel, indeed unprece-
dented approach  to  standing.  In  its basic  orientation,  however,  Data
Processing reflected  the emerging  and highly tenable  view,  reflected  in
more plausible interpretations  of the APA, that saw regulatory benefi-
ciaries  as  suffering  "legal  injuries."' 1 14  The  case  thus  bears  some  re-
semblance  to  the  lower  court  opinions  on  that  point,  opinions  that
could  claim to  rest  on the basic  APA  framework.11 5

a.  Beneficiaries as objects,  objects  as  beneficiaries.  I  have  sug-
gested  that  the  emerging  principles  of  standing  could  be  associated
with a particular belief about what  caused  administrative  failure.  The
grant  of  beneficiary  standing  stemmed  in  part  from  understandings
about the diffuse  and disorganized  character  of the class  of regulatory
beneficiaries.  If the beneficiaries  had no  greater  influence  than  the  ob-

jects,  and often  even  less,  it seemed  odd  to say  that the objects  would
be the only  ones  entitled  to  seek judicial  review.

In  a  deeper  sense,  however,  we  might  understand  the  grant  of
standing to  regulatory  beneficiaries  as  a broad judicial  effort  to  adapt
administrative  law  to  the  principles  and  aspirations  of  the  modem
state.  The New Deal reformation  of the American  legal system would
ultimately  make  it impossible  and  indeed  hubristic  for  courts  to  say
that the "objects"  of regulation,  equipped  with common law  interests,
would  receive  greater protection  than the beneficiaries,  equipped  with
statutory  interests.  The New  Deal had  itself been  a wholesale  attack
on the idea that common law  interests  deserved  special  constitutional
status. 116  Under  the New  Deal view,  the common  law  was  a regula-
tory  system  that  should  be  evaluated  pragmatically,  in  terms  of
whether  it served human liberty and welfare.  When it failed  to do  so,
the system  had  to be supplemented  or  replaced.

The  New  Deal,  of course,  produced  a  number  of new  measures
designed  to  protect new interests  and to  regulate  unfair and deceptive
trade practices,  the securities  market,  and much more. 117  The  result-
ing set of legislative  and administrative  initiatives generally  reflected  a
democratic judgment  that the new  interests now  protected  by  statute
the interests  of consumers,  listeners,  poor people,  and  so forth  -
-
should  receive  no  less  protection  than  the interests  traditionally  pro-
tected  by  the  common law.

By  repudiating  the  distinction  between  objects  and  beneficiaries,
the new law of standing served to adapt traditional administrative  doc-
trines  to  the  nature  and  aspirations  of  modem  government.  In  the
context of standing, the reluctance  to take this step has been embodied
that is, in the idea that standing
in a private law model  of standing  -
should  be  reserved  principally  to  people  with  common  law  interests
and denied to  people without  such interests.  This  idea reflects a Loch-
ner-like conception  of public  law. 18  It defines modem  public  law  by
reference  to  common  law  principles  that  appear  nowhere  in  the
Constitution.

The private law model of standing is based on understandings  that
are not  only without  constitutional  foundation,  but that seemed  to  be
foreclosed by democratic judgments  following  the New Deal.  Indeed,
that model  seemed  to  draw  upon  the  discredited  view  that common
law  and  laissez-faire  principles  are  part  of  the  Constitution,  to  be

deployed  by  unelected judges  as the vehicle  for the definition  of a sys-
tem  of public  law  sharply  opposed  to  modem  regulatory  institutions.
We  can  go even  further.  After the New Deal,  the very  distinction
between  regulatory  beneficiaries  and  regulatory  objects  seemed  based
on  a conceptual  mistake.  That distinction  treated  the common  law as
the  normal  and  natural  state  of  affairs;  it  saw  a  deviation  from  the
common law  as an  intrusion on  some  "object,"  and as  a protection  of
some  "beneficiary." 
Indeed,  the  definition  of  the  "object"  and  the
"beneficiary"  was  parasitic  on  common  law.  But  this was  a way  for
courts to load the dice.  Indeed, this understanding  was no  longer con-
sistent with  the practices  and  values  of modem  government.

The  so-called  regulatory  objects  were  in  fact  beneficiaries  of law,
insofar  as  it  was  law  -
statutory  or  common  -
that  conferred  on
them the set of entitlements that created  a protected  sphere  of action.
Suppose, for example,  that an industry  attempted  to fend  off an occu-
pational  safety regulation that it believed unlawful.  The industry's rel-
evant rights were legal ones,  and these  established it as  a "beneficiary"
of positive law.  Similarly, the beneficiaries  of regulation  could equally
be  seen  as  "objects"  of law  insofar  as  it  was  the law  -
statutory  or
common  -
that authorized  private and  public  intrusions  on their in-
terests.  Workers,  for example,  were the "objects"  of the common  law
insofar  as  that law  enabled  employers  to  exclude  them  from  the  em-
ployer's  land  whenever  employers  so chose. 119  The  rise of the regula-
tory  state  rendered  the  distinction  between  regulatory  objects  and
regulatory beneficiaries  a conceptual  anachronism,  a relic of the Loch-
ner period.

b.  The impossibility of "'injury [solely] in fact."  There is a related
and even  deeper  conceptual  issue,  connected  with the notion  of injury
in fact, and bearing both on the current  discussion and on the develop-
ments  culminating  in  Lujan.  The Data Processing Court  appears  to
have thought that it was greatly  simplifying matters by shifting from a
complex inquiry  of law (is there  a legal injury?)  to an exceedingly  sim-
ple,  law-free  inquiry  into  fact  (is  there  a  factual harm?).  That  Court,
and its successors  (the Lujan Court among them), seem to assume  that
whether  there  is  an  "injury"  can  be  answered  as  if it  were  a  purely
factual matter  -
as  if the existence  of injury depended  on  some brute
fact, not  on  evaluation,  and not  on law.  But this  is  false.120

In  classifying  some  harms  as  injuries  in  fact  and  other  harms  as

119.  Cf Jeremy  Waldron,  Homelessness and the Issue of Freedom, 39 UCLA  L.  REv.  295,

Standing After  Lujan

purely  ideological, 121  courts  must  inevitably  rely  on  some  standard
that is  normatively laden and  independent  of facts.  If the point seems
obscure,  it is  only because  there  are  reasonably  well-established  con-
ventions  on  what  counts  as  an  injury,  and  these  conventions  tend  to
disguise the normative judgments  and make them  seem purely factual.
But in every case,  the person who brings a lawsuit believes that she has
indeed  suffered  an  injury  in  fact.

When  blacks  challenge  a  grant  of  tax  deductions  to  segregated
schools,  they  believe  that the  grant  is  an  injury  in  fact,  not that  it is
purely  ideological. 122  When  an environmentalist  complains  about the
destruction  of a pristine  area,  he  believes  that the loss  of that area  is
indeed an injury to him.  When we deny these claims, we are making  a
judgment  based  not  on  any fact, but  instead  on  an  inquiry  into  what
should  count  as a judicially cognizable  injury.  This judgment  may be
right,  but it has  little to  do  with facts  or concreteness.

As stated, my claim may  seem obscure,  even  exotic.  It is tempting
to  respond that  there is a real, factual difference  between someone  who
has been fined  $100  and someone in New  York who  objects to a policy
of racial  discrimination  in California.  One might think that in the for-
mer case there "just is"  an injury, and that in the latter case there "just
isn't."1 23  The  loss  of money  is  a  real  and  tangible  harm;  the offense
produced by  objectionable  government  policy may be intense, but it is
merely  offense.

There  are  indeed  factual  differences  between  these  cases,  but it  is
not true that the first case  involves a factual harm and the second does
not.  Both  cases  involve harm,  as  evidenced by  the fact that people  in
both cases  have  been prompted to  take the time,  trouble,  and expense
to initiate proceedings.  We might deny that someone objecting  to gov-
ernment  policy  has  suffered  harm,  and even  label  him a bystander;1 24
but, if we  do this,  we are importing  our  own, value-laden  ideas  about
what things  ought  to  count.  We  are  not simply  describing  some  fact
about  the world.

If the  claim  remains  obscure,  the Havens Realty  case12 5  may  be
helpful.  One of the issues in  that case  was  whether standing  could be
people  who  do  not  intend  to  rent  or
conferred  on  "testers"  -

purchase a home  or apartment  but who  pose  as renters  or purchasers
in order to  collect  information  about unlawfully  discriminatory  racial
steering.  Without any  statute,  testers  could  not  possibly  have  stand-
ing.  It would  not  matter  if they  perceived  an  "injury  in  fact"  when
they  were  given  false,  discriminatorily  motivated  information  about
the housing market.  But Congress  declared it unlawful  "[to represent
to  any person  because  of race,  color,  religion,  sex,  handicap,  familial
status, or national  origin that any  dwelling  is  not available  for  inspec-
tion,  sale,  or  rental  when  such  dwelling  is  in  fact  so  available"  and
created  a cause  of action  to  enforce  this right. 12 6  The Havens Realty
Court held that, in  view  of this statute,  Congress  had conferred  a sort
of legal  interest  on  testers  and  provided  that  it  could  be  legally  re-
dressed.  The  injury  to the  "statutorily  created right  to  truthful  hous-
ing information"  was  sufficient  for  constitutional  purposes. 127

It cannot be right to say that the plaintiff in Havens Realty suffered
no  injury  in  fact  before  Congress  had  acted,  and  that the civil  rights
statute  somehow  conjured  up an  injury  ("in  fact"!).  Instead  the rele-
vant  statute created  a legally cognizable  harm where  none had existed
before.  Despite the Havens Realty Court's bow  in the direction  of in-
jury in fact, 128 the case  shows that the real question is what harms that
people  perceive  as  such  ought  to be judicially  cognizable.  The  out-
come in the case had nothing to do  with "injury  in fact."  It had every-
thing to do  with the set of legal rights  that Congress  had conferred. 129
In these  circumstances,  whether  there is  a  so-called  nonjusticiable
ideological  interest, or instead  a legally  cognizable  "actual  injury,"  is a
product of legal  conventions and nothing else.  To people who  are part
of  the legal  culture,  some  harms  obviously  count  as  such,  but  only
because  those  claims  are  so  familiar.  Their  familiarity  often  stems
from the fact  that they were  protected  at  common  law.  To the  same
people,  some  harms  are  not perceived  as  such, but only  because  they

129.  Consider also  the closely  related  case of Trafficante v.  Metropolitan  Life  Ins. Co.,  409
U.S.  205  (1972).  There,  two  tenants  of a  large  apartment  complex  in  California  complained
about their landlord's racially  discriminatory  practices.  They  contended  that these  practices de-
prived  them  of "important  benefits  from  interracial  association."  409  U.S.  at 210.  The  Court
allowed  standing  under  a statute  explicitly  granting  the  right  to sue.  In a  concurring  opinion,
Justice  White  rightly  said  that, without  the statute, he  "would  have  great  difficulty  in  conclud-
ing"  that there  was  a  case or controversy.  409 U.S.  at  212.  Without  the statute,  we  would  say
that the plaintiffs  had a merely  ideological  injury;  perhaps we  would  not be able  to see the harm
they  suffered  as an injury at all.  After the enactment of the statute, however, a unanimous  Court
concluded  that standing could  be found.  Is it even plausible  to think that there was no  "injury  in
fact"  before the statute,  and  thus  that the California plaintiffs  came  to experience  an  injury  ("in
fact"l)  the day  that Congress  passed  a law  in  the District  of Columbia?

are unfamiliar.  Their unfamiliarity  often stems from the fact that they
are  foreign  to  the common law.

Whether  an  injury  is  cognizable,  however,  should  not depend  on
its familiarity  or its common law pedigree;  this approach  would repre-
sent a  conspicuous  reintroduction  of Lochner-era notions  of substan-
tive  due process.  Whether  an injury  is  cognizable  should  depend  on
what the legislature  has  said,  explicitly  or implicitly,  or on the defini-
tions of injury  provided in the various relevant  sources  of positive  law.
The Court should abandon the metaphysics  of injury in fact.  It should
return  to the question whether  a cause of action has been  conferred on
the plaintiff.

c.  On  law  and fact.  If my point  still  remains  unclear,  we might
think  a  bit  about  what  it  really  means  for  someone  to  have  a legal
interest in  a problem or dispute.  If I am offended  because Jones  com-
mits  a  tort  against  Smith,  I  apparently  have  no  such  interest,  and  I
have  no  standing  to  sue Jones.  But  if Smith is  my spouse,  or my em-
ployee,  the law may  well have given me a legal interest, and I may well
have  standing  to  sue.  If the actions  of the U.S.  government  result in
destruction  of the rainforest,  I have no  legal  interest and  no  standing
to  sue the government,  and there  is no case or controversy under Arti-
cle III.  But suppose that Congress  grants  American  citizens standing
to  sue their government  for acts  destructive  of the rainforest.  If it does
so, it has, in effect, granted  every American both a beneficial  interest in
the  rainforest  and  a  legal  right  to  protect  that  interest  in  court.  A
cause of action,  of course,  is a  property  interest. 130

When  Congress  creates  a cause  of action  enabling  people  to  com-
plain against  racial  discrimination,  consumer  fraud,  or  destruction  of
environmental  assets, it is really  giving people  a kind of property  right
in  a certain  state  of  affairs. 13 1  Invasion  of that property  right  is  the
relevant  injury.  If some  of these  things  seem  to  be  "property"  only
ambiguously,  we  might  recall  a  lesson  from  law  school's  first  year:
property is simply a bundle of sticks,  and property  rights can  exist in a
wide variety  of tangible  and intangible  matters.  Nothing  in  the Con-
stitution  forbids  Congress  from  creating  property  interests  of  these
various  kinds  or  from  allowing  people  to  vindicate  those  interests  in
court. 1

Michigan Law Review

[Vol.  91:163

The resistance to this general approach  stems from the deep  famili-
arity  of  the  common  law  catalogue  of  legal  rights;  people,  or  more
importantly judges pondering  "injury  in  fact,"  tend  to  think of prop-
erty  in  terms  of  that  particular  catalogue.  But  the  notion  that  the
common law  exhausts Congress'  power,  and that the Constitution  for-
bids it from intruding  on that catalogue or creating new  legal rights, is
(I repeat)  simply  a  modem  form  of substantive  due process.  Indeed,
the parallel with  substantive  due process  is very  precise.  In the  early
twentieth century,  the common law catalogue was similarly  thought to
be  part  of  the  state  of nature,  or  of  "how  things  are,"  and  thus  to
operate  as  a  barrier  to  legislative  efforts  to  redefine  property  inter-
ests. 133  The  examples  suggest  that there  are innumerable  "injuries  in
fact"  produced  by  public  and  private  action.  Many  of those  injuries
might well produce lawsuits.  But an injury can become judicially cog-
nizable  if and only  if it has  received  legal  status  from  some  source  of
law.  To  this extent,  the Data Processing Court's attempted  shift  from
law  to  fact  was  doomed  to  fail  from  the beginning.

I conclude  with an  analogy.  For  many  decades,  a conflict  of laws
between  two jurisdictions would be resolved  by  seeing where  the right
had  "vested." 13 4  If the  right  had  vested  in  state  A,  that  state's  law
would  apply;  if it had  vested in state B, the parties  would be governed
by  the law  of state B.  Courts approached  the question  where has the
right vested?  as  if it were  a simple  issue  of fact.  But eventually  it be-
came clear  that this was no factual  inquiry, but instead  a policy judg-
ment, to be answered by reference  to the law of the relevant  states and,
where  these  did  not  speak,  to  the best  possible judicial  inferences  on
the matter.1 35

The  same  should  be true  of the law  of standing.  In  the long  run,
the injury-in-fact test will,  I believe,  be seen  as the contemporary  ana-
logue  of  the  discredited  notion  of  "vested  rights"  in  the  law  of
conflicts.

3.  The  Congressionally Created Citizen Suit

So much  for  conceptual  matters.  A  final  development  is  relevant
to the period under  discussion.  Spurred by judicial developments  and

ward a new  emphasis  on the definition  and implementation  of public values.  See  id. at 23-27.  If
what I am  suggesting  is  right,  however,  abandoning  the touchstone  of property  is  not  so  easy.
Standing depends  on some legal  interest, however  much we  might try to redirect  the inquiry, and
if it  depends on legal  interest,  it  depends  on something  like  property.

suspicion  of agency  "capture,"  Congress  created  a wide range  of citi-
zens'  suits. 13 6  These  suits would  be  available  against  (a)  private  de-
fendants operating  in violation of statute and (b) administrators failing
to  enforce  the law  as  Congress  required.  Congress  was  especially  en-
thusiastic  about  such  suits  in  the environmental  area,  addressing  the
fear  that statutory  commitments  would  be threatened by bureaucratic
failure.  With a number  of devices,  including the citizen suit,  Congress
hoped  to  overcome  administrative  laxity and  unenthusiasm,  and  also
to counteract  the relatively  weak political influence  of beneficiaries. 137
Congress  did not, however,  devote  much attention to  the constitution-
ality  of citizen  standing,  and  the issue  was  to  remain  open for  many
years.

E.  Redressability, Causation, and the Separation of Powers

The  fifth  stage  of standing  law  is  the  contemporary  one.  I begin
to  some  apparent  motivating

with  description  and  then  turn 
assumptions.

1.  New Departures

This period  is  defined  principally  by  a series  of cases  establishing
that the plaintiff does not  suffer injury  in fact unless  he can show  that
(a) the injury  is  attributable  to  the  conduct  of the  defendant  and  (b)
the  injury  is  likely  to  be redressed  by  a  decree  on  his  behalf.  A  less
obvious but  equally  important  development  is  the  Court's  tacit  insis-
tence  that  the requisite  injury  in  fact  be defined  in  common  law-like
terms.  A  still less  obvious development  is  the renewed  use  of Article
II in standing  cases; indeed,  it may not be unfair to  say that Article II
concerns  are coming  to  dominate the interpretation  of Article  III.  As
I will  suggest, the Lujan opinion is motivated by many  of the concerns
expressed  in Justice Scalia's dissenting  opinion  in Morrison v.  Olson, 138
the independent  counsel  case.

136.  See supra note  11.
137.  In my view, this  is an inadequate  diagnosis of the basic problem  of bureaucratic  failure.
A  large  part of that  problem  is  command  and control  regulation and  inadequate  congressional
attention  to the  problem  of incentives  imposed  on  administrative  agencies  and  industries  alike.
The  question is therefore not  whether we should  have  "more"  as opposed  to "less"  enforcement,
but instead  how  to  create  incentives  for  the right  level  of enforcement.  Command and  control
regulation  accompanied  by  the citizen  suit  is  hardly  an  ideal  solution.  See  R.  Shep  Melnick,
Pollution Deadlines and the Coalition for Failure, in ENVIRONMENTAL  POLITICS  89  (Michael  S.
Greve  & Fred  L.  Smith, Jr., eds.,  1992);  infra text accompanying  note 265-69.  For a  more gen-
eral  diagnosis,  see  Cass  R.  Sunstein,  Democratizing America  Through Law, 25  SuFFOLK  U. L.

[Vol.  91:163

Notably,  most  of  the  key  cases  have  involved  attempts  by  some
plaintiff to require  the executive branch  to fulfill  its statutory  responsi-
bilities  by  enforcing  the  law  more  vigorously.  The  initial  step  was
Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 139 in which a mother  of an illegitimate  child
brought suit against the local prosecutor, contending  that his failure to
initiate child support proceedings against  the child's father caused  her
harm.  The  Court denied  standing  on  the  ground that  it was  unclear
whether  a decree in the plaintiff's favor would remedy  that harm.  The
father  might  simply  go to  jail,  leaving  the  mother  no  better  off than
before.  According to the Court, this possibility rendered purely  "spec-
ulative"  whether  prosecutorial  proceedings  would  yield  the  desired
outcome.140

The Linda R.S.  decision  was  followed  by Simon  v. Eastern Ken-
tucky  Welfare Rights Organization. 14 1  There,  the Court denied  stand-
ing to indigent people  protesting a change in tax policy  which reduced
the obligation  of hospitals  to  provide  medical  services  to  the indigent.
The  plaintiffs  claimed  that they  had  sought  and been  denied  medical
treatment  as a result of this ruling.  According  to the Court, the plain-
tiffs could not show that the changed  policy actually affected  their own
situation.  "It is  purely  speculative  whether  the denials  of service...
fairly  can  be traced  to  petitioners'  'encouragement'  or  instead  result
from  decisions  made  by  the  hospitals  without  regard  to  the  tax
implications." 142

The third key  case was Allen  v.  Wright. 14 3  In that case,  the Court
said that parents  of black  children  attending  public  schools  that  were
undergoing desegregation  lacked  standing to challenge the grant of tax
deductions  to  segregated  private  schools.  The  pivotal  point  was  that
the  plaintiffs  could  not  show  that a  decree  in their  favor would  actu-
ally affect their children.  Denial of the tax deduction would not neces-
sarily  benefit  the  plaintiffs.  Any  causal  relationship  between  the
deduction  and the progress  of any  particular  desegregation  plan  was,
again,  fatally  "speculative."' 144

An  especially  important  section  of the Allen  opinion  referred  to
Article  II and to  the separation  of powers.  The  Court explained  that,
if the plaintiffs  were  to have standing, judges would  become  "virtually

continuing  monitors  of  the  wisdom  and  soundness  of  Executive  ac-
tion."'14  The Court also suggested  that standing here would risk judi-
cial  usurpation  of the  President's  power  to  "take  Care that  the Laws
be faithfully  executed."' 146  Standing  should  thus be unavailable  "in  a
case brought,  not  to  enforce  specific  legal  obligations  whose  violation
works  a direct  harm,  but  to  seek  a restructuring  of the apparatus  es-
tablished  by  the Executive  Branch  to fulfill  its legal  duties."' 14 7  These
suggestions  - with Article  II  concerns  prominently  appearing  in an
Article  III  setting  -

have  proved  extremely  important.

2.  General Trends in Administrative Law

The cases  in this fifth period of standing law reveal  a more  general
trend  in  administrative  law,  a  trend  of which Lujan  is  very  much  a
part.  The  fourth  stage  had  witnessed  a fundamental  assault  on  the
distinction between  regulated  objects  and  regulatory beneficiaries.  In
the past fifteen years, however, the Supreme Court has unmistakably  if
usually  implicitly  insisted  on that very  distinction.

Professor Antonin  Scalia of the University of Chicago  Law  School
made  his  enthusiasm  for the object-beneficiary  distinction  clear in  an
influential  1978  article  on the  Vermont  Yankee  case. 14 8  In  one of the
first  statements  of this  position,  Scalia  wrote  that  aggressive  judicial
review  of administrative  action  would  be  most  understandable  when
regulated  industries  were  at risk and least understandable  when regu-
latory beneficiaries  sought greater regulation.' 49  The  Vermont Yankee
case  itself had nothing  to  do  with  standing.  But  there  the  Court  ex-
pressed  firm  disapproval  of active  judicial  policing  of administrative
policies,  and perhaps  it was not  a coincidence  that the case involved  a
suit by regulatory beneficiaries  who  wanted to bring about more strin-
gent regulatory  controls  on  nuclear  power. 150

A  key-case,  highly  representative  of current  tendencies,  is Heckler

v.  Chaney.15
agency action,  would be presumed immune from judicial review.  In so

holding,  the  Court  apparently  drew  a  distinction  between  regulated
objects  and  regulatory  beneficiaries.  Indeed,  the  Court  defended  its
conclusion  in part  by  suggesting  that,  when  an  agency  fails  to  act,  it
"does  not  exercise  its  coercive power..,  and  thus  does  not  infringe
upon  areas  that  courts  are  often  called  upon  to  protect." 15 2  Appar-
ently,  only  the  interests  of  the  objects  generally  are  protected.  The
Chaney Court also referred  to the Take Care Clause  of Article  II, sug-
gesting  that  this  provided  a  further  reason  for judicial  reluctance  to
supervise administrative  inaction.  In this way, Heckler v.  Chaney is of
a  piece  with Allen  v.  Wright and Lujan.  In  many  other  cases,  the
Court has  rejected challenges  to administrative  decisions by regulatory
beneficiaries.

153

As noted,  most of the key standing cases  involved efforts by regula-
tory beneficiaries  to require  enforcement of regulatory  statutes.  Before
Lujan, the  law  thus  stood  poised  for  an  explicit  judicial  distinction
between  suits  by  objects  and  suits by  beneficiaries.

3. 

"Beneficiaries" Versus  "Objects"

What underlies  the  current  trend?  There  are  several  possibilities,
and all of them have probably contributed to a growing enthusiasm  for
the apparently  discredited  distinction  between  regulatory  beneficiaries
and  regulated  objects.  The  possibilities  should  be  seen  as  a  modem
theoretical  rejoinder to  the 1960s  and  1970s fear  of agency  capture by
regulated  objects.

Some observers,  for example,  think that  government  regulation  of
private  ordering  is constitutionally  suspect.15 4  The  academic  enthusi-
asm  for  greater  constitutional  checks  on  the regulatory  state  has  ap-
judicial  support.15 5  Whether  or  not
parently 
government regulation is unconstitutional,  many people  think that it is
morally  problematic,  and  perhaps  this  view  too  has  support  on  the
Supreme  Court.1 56  Other  people  think  that  government  regulation
does not work in practice  -
that it produces  high social  costs for du-

bious benefits. 157  This view has influenced  the executive branch, and it
has  appeared  to play  a role in the courts as well.' 58  Many people  think
that  administrators  are  systematically  inclined  toward  overenforce-
ment  of regulatory statutes,  or toward  "capture"  by regulatory  benefi-
ciaries.1 59  Quite  apart  from  issues  of  substance,  some  urge  that
judicial  compulsion of regulatory  action is unconstitutional  on  Article
II  grounds  or  at  least  constitutionally  troublesome. 160  Others  think
that  courts  cannot  possibly  play  a fruitful  role  in  assuring  adequate
implementation  of regulatory  statutes. 16'  Some  or  all  of these  ideas
undoubtedly  help  explain  what has  become  an unmistakable  trend in
favor  of greater judicial insistence  on the distinction between  suits by
regulating beneficiaries  and suits  by regulated  objects.1 62

II.  LUJAN.  DESCRIPTION  AND  APPRAISAL

In this Part, I turn to Lujan. 163 I first discuss  what the Court said
and then  evaluate  its reasoning.  Two detours  will be necessary:  first,
to address  Justice Scalia's  conception  of standing;  and second,  to deal
with the role  of the citizen  suit  in environmental  and  regulatory  pol-
icy.  I conclude  with  a brief suggestion  about how Lujan should have
been written.

A.  What the Court Said

The Lujan  case  arose  under  the Endangered  Species  Act  of  1973
(ESA). 64  The ESA is  an aggressive  set of protections for endangered
species.165  Its  key provision  says that  "Each  Federal  agency  shall, in
consultation with and with the assistance  of the Secretary  [of the Inte-
rior],  insure that any action authorized,  funded,  or carried  out by such
agency... is  not  likely  to jeopardize  the continued  existence  of any
endangered  species  .... "166

[Vol.  91:163

For  many  years  it  has  been  uncertain  whether  the  obligations  of
the  ESA  apply  to  actions  of the  U.S.  government  that  are  taken  in
foreign  countries.  In  1978,  the  relevant  authorities  agreed  that  the
ESA  did indeed  apply  outside  the United  States. 167  But in  1983,  the
Interior  Department  initiated a change  in its  position.  An  important
new  regulation,  ultimately  issued  in  1986,  announced  that  the  ESA
would  apply  only  to  actions  within  the United  States  or  on  the high
seas. 168

The  regulation  had  a  number  of important  consequences.  Ameri-
can  agencies  funding  foreign projects  were  no longer required  to  con-
sult  with  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior  if  their  projects  would
jeopardize  the existence  of endangered  species.  The  ESA  would  pro-
vide  no  obstacle  to the  expenditure  of American  taxpayer  dollars  to
projects  that would  threaten  to  eliminate  endangered  species  outside
U.S.  borders.

Environmental  organizations,  including  Defenders  of  Wildlife,
brought suit, claiming that the new regulation  violated the statute.  To
establish standing, two members of Defenders  of Wildlife claimed  that
they  suffered  an injury  in  fact.  Joyce  Kelly  swore  in  an  affidavit  that
she had traveled  to Egypt in  1986 and viewed the habitat of the endan-
gered  Nile  crocodile.  She  claimed  that  she "intended  to  do  so  again,
and  hoped  to  observe  the crocodile  directly."  Amy  Skilbred  claimed
that she had traveled  to Sri  Lanka in  1981  and observed  the habitat of
"endangered  species  such as the Asian elephant and the leopard."  She
also  claimed  that she intended  to  return  to  Sri Lanka  to  see  members
of these  species.  In  a  deposition,  she  acknowledged  that she  did not
have  a certain  date  for return. 169

The  Court's  opinion,  devoted  entirely  to  the issue  of standing,  is
quite  straightforward.  It  falls  into  four  parts:  a  general  statement
about standing;  a  discussion  of injury in  fact;  an assessment  of redres-
sability;  and a  treatment  of the  citizen suit.

The  general statement  begins  with a  description  of the function  of
standing in a system of separation  of powers.  According to the Court,
Article  III requires  an  "irreducible  constitutional  minimum  of stand-
ing,"  with three elements:  (1) an injury in fact that is both (a) concrete
and particularized  and  (b)  actual  or imminent rather than  conjectural
or hypothetical;  (2) a  demonstration  that the injury  is fairly  traceable
to the acts of the defendant,  rather than of some third party; and (3)  a

showing that it is  likely that the injury  will be redressed  by  a decision
favorable  to  the plaintiff.170

This  opening  statement  breaks  little  new  ground.  But  the  Court
added  that  the  standing  issue  will  often  be  affected  by  "whether  the
plaintiff  is  himself  an  object  of  the  action  (or  forgone  action)  at  is-
sue." 17 1  If the plaintiff is an object, the three requirements will ordina-
rily  be  met.  But  when  an  "injury  arises  from  the  government's
allegedly  unlawful  regulation  (or  lack  of regulation)  of someone else,
much  more  is  needed." 172  In  such  cases,  there  is  the  problem  that
"causation  and  redressability  ordinarily  hinge  on  the  response  of the
regulated  (or regulable)  third party to the government  action  or inac-
and perhaps  on the response  of others  as  well." 173  The  Court
tion -
suggested that in such cases  standing "is  ordinarily 'substantially  more
difficult'  to establish." 174  The Court had implicitly drawn this distinc-
tion  in Allen  v.  Wright, 175  but Lujan  was  the  first  case  explicitly  to
mark  out  the categories.

So  much  for the  preliminaries.  The  Court's  first specific  holding
was  that an  injury  in fact  had  not been  established.  The intention  to
visit  the  places  harboring  endangered  species  was  not  enough.  The
plaintiffs  had set out no particular plans.  They  specified no time when
their indefinite plans would materialize.  Thus they had shown no "ac-
tual or imminent"  injury. 176  Nor could  plaintiffs  show injuries  in  fact
by  demonstrating  a  nexus  linking  the  affected  habitats  with  all  the
world's  ecosystems, or linking their own "professional"  interests in ob-
serving  endangered  species  with  the  interests  of  all  persons  so  en-
gaged.177  The fact  that ecosystems  are  generally  interrelated  was  not
enough,  because  the plaintiffs  could  not show that they  used portions
of an  ecosystem  "perceptibly  affected  by the unlawful  action in  ques-
tion." 178  Standing was  similarly  not available  to  anyone having an in-
in  studying  or  seeing  endangered  species,  because  of  a
terest 
professional  commitment  or  otherwise.  There  must  be  "a  factual
showing  of perceptible  harm." 179  This,  then, was  the Court's  reason-

ing  on  injury  in  fact.

The second conclusion in Justice Scalia's opinion,  accepted  by only
a plurality  of the Court, was  that the plaintiffs  could not  show redres-
sability.  According  to  the plurality,  the difficulty  lay  in the  fact  that
the plaintiffs  were  challenging  a general  regulation  not requiring  con-
sultation with the Secretary of the Interior for funding actions  outside
of the  United  States.  There  were  two  problems,  suggesting  that  the
plaintiffs  might not benefit  from  a decree  in  their favor.

First, suppose that the district court awarded  relief against the Sec-
retary;  suppose  that  it  required  the  Secretary  to  issue  a  regulation
mandating  consultation  with him  for  foreign  projects  threatening  an
endangered species.  It would remain unclear  that the funding agencies
would be bound by this regulation.  They might simply  ignore  it; they
might not consult at all.  For this reason,  there would be no clear ben-
efits  to  the plaintiffs  from  a  favorable  ruling.

Second,  the American  agencies provide only part of the funding for
the  relevant  foreign  projects.  Most  of  the  money  comes  from  else-
where.  "AID, for example,  has  provided  less  than  10%  of the fund-
ing"  for one of the projects at issue in the case. 13 0  Justice Scalia  found
it unclear whether  the elimination  of that partial fraction  would affect
the  projects  or  the  species  in  question.  "[I]t  is  entirely  conjectural
whether the nonagency  activity that affects respondents  will be altered
or  affected  by  the agency  action  they  seek  to  achieve."18 1  The  plain-
tiffs  could  not  show  redressability,  because  a  decree  on  their  behalf
might  not yield their  desired  result.

The Court's third conclusion was  its most  important.  The court of
appeals  had relied  on the citizen-suit provision  of the ESA, permitting
"any  person  [to]  commence a civil  suit on his  own behalf (A) to enjoin
any person,  including the  United  States and  any  other  governmental
instrumentality  or agency..,  who  is  alleged  to be in  violation of any
provision of this chapter."18 2  In a discussion with large consequences,
the  Court  held  in  effect  that  this  provision  was  unconstitutional  as
applied.

The  Court  emphasized  that  Article  III  requires  something  more
than  "a  generally  available  grievance  about  government  -
claiming
only  harm  to  his  and  every  citizen's  interest  in  proper  application  of
the Constitution  and laws, and seeking  relief that no more directly  and

might  serve  to  establish  injuries  in  fact  in  other  cases.  See  112  S. Ct.  at  2146  (Kennedy,  J.,

tangibly benefits  him  than it does  the public  at large." 183  To  support
this  contention,  the  Court  cited  cases  from  the  1920s  and  1930s  re-
jecting  suits by citizens  complaining about government  action on con-
stitutional  grounds.  It also  pointed  to  a  number  of  post-1970  cases
appearing  to  suggest  that Article  III  in fact  required  a particularized
injury. 184

The Court acknowledged  that in none of these cases  had Congress
explicitly  granted  citizens  a  right  to  bring  suit.  But  in  the  Court's
view,  this  difference  did  not  matter.  The  Court  emphasized  that
"[v]indicating  the public interest (including  the public interest  in gov-
ernment  observance  of the  Constitution  and  laws)  is  the  function  of
Congress  and the  Chief Executive."1' Is  In  particular,  the  Court  said
that if Congress  could turn  "the undifferentiated  public interest  in ex-
ecutive  officers'  compliance with the law  into an 'individual  right'  vin-
dicable  in the courts," 18 6 it would  be transferring  "from  the President
to  the  courts  the  Chief  Executive's  most  important  constitutional
duty,"  that is, "to  'take  Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.'  "187
Thus,  the  Court's  decision  rested  on  the fear  that, if Congress  could
grant  standing  here,  it  would  turn  the  judges  into  overseers,  and
usurpers,  of the President  himself.  Here Article II helped  give context
to  Article  III.

Justice  Kennedy,  joined  by  Justice  Souter,  offered  an  intriguing
and  somewhat  ambiguous  concurring  opinion.  He  emphasized  that,
had  the plaintiffs  purchased  an  airplane  ticket,  set  a  specific  date  to
visit the habitat of the endangered species mentioned,  or used the rele-
vant sites on a regular basis, they might have established  standing in  a
case  of this kind. 88  Indeed, Justice  Kennedy  was not willing  to fore-
close  the  possibility  that  standing  might  be  allowed  on  the  basis  of
some  "nexus"  theory. 189  He  indicated  that  courts  "must  be sensitive
to  the articulation  of new  rights  of action  that do  not have  clear  ana-
logs in our common-law  tradition."' 190  Thus  "Congress  has  the power
to  define  injuries  and articulate  chains  of causation  that will  give rise
to  a case  or  controversy  where  none  existed  before."' 9'  But  in  this

case  Congress  refused  to  "identify  the injury  it seeks  to  vindicate  and
relate  the injury  to  the class  of persons  entitled  to  bring  suit.1' ' 92  In
any  case,  Article  III  does  not  permit  Congress  to  allow  courts  "to
vindicate  the  public's  nonconcrete  interest  in  the  proper  administra-
tion  of the  laws.  While  it  does  not  matter  how  many  persons  have
been  injured  by  the  challenged  action,  the  party  bringing  suit  must
show  that the action  injures him  in  a  concrete  and  personal  way. ' 193

Each conclusion in the principal  opinion is of considerable interest.

I take  them  up in  sequence.

B.  Evaluation

1.  Injury

The  Court's conclusion  on the matter of injury  raises  three differ-
ent  issues.  The  first  is  whether  the  plaintiffs  did indeed  show  an  in-
jury,  assuming  the  Court's  definition  of  what  the  injury  was.  The
second  is  whether  the  plaintiffs  could  have  been  permitted  to
recharacterize  their injury  in a different  way.  The third has to  do with
the general problems  in  the very  notion  of injury  in  fact.

If  we  accept  the  Court's  definition  of  injury,  its  conclusion  was
perhaps an  innovation,  but not an  entirely  implausible  one.  Its  chief
importance  lay in  the insistence  that the injury  must  be  "imminent."
It is  true that none  of the plaintiffs  could prove that they would revisit
the relevant  sites.  So  long  as  injury  in  fact  is  required,  perhaps  this
point  is  decisive.  Perhaps the  plaintiffs  failed  to  show  with  sufficient

192.  112  S.  Ct. at 2147  (Kennedy,  J., concurring).
193.  112  S.  Ct. at 2147  (Kennedy,  J., concurring).
There  were two other separate  opinions.  Justice Stevens concurred  in  the judgment.  112  S.
Ct. at 2147.  He concluded that plaintiffs had standing  because some of them had visited  a critical
habitat of an endangered  species,  shown  a professional  interest  in  preserving  the species  and  its
habitats,  and  intended to revisit them  in the future.  They  did not  need  to show  that  the return
visit  was  imminent.  They  would suffer  the relevant  injury,  sufficient  for Article  III  purposes,  as
soon as the species was  destroyed.  Justice Stevens also contested the matter  of redressability.  He
would have presumed  that, if the Court required funding agencies  to consult with  the Secretary,
the agencies  would  abide by  the Court's interpretation,  and  that consultation  would  yield tangi-
ble results.  Justice Stevens concurred  only because he concluded  that, on  the merits, the ESA  did
not apply  overseas.

Justice  Blackmun  dissented  in  an  opinion  joined  by Justice O'Connor.  112  S.  Ct.  at  2151.
Justice  Blackmun  emphasized  that  Kelly  and  Skilbred  swore  that  they  would  soon  return  to
relevant  project sites.  In his  view, a  reasonable finder of fact  could  find that this  was  likely, thus
confirming  plaintiffs'  injury  in fact.  The  distant location  of the Asian  elephant was  irrelevant  to
the  fact  that  its  destruction  would  impose  a  professional  injury  on  the  plaintiffs.  Moreover,
plaintiffs  met  the redressability  requirement,  for a  threatened  withdrawal  of American  funding
might well affect  foreign government conduct.  If American  funds were  withdrawn,  the possibil-
ity  that the project  might be scaled  back or eliminated  was  sufficient  to  establish  redressability.

certainty  that they  would  be  affected  by  the government  decisions  at
issue  in  the case.

An argument  to the contrary would suggest that one of the original
purposes of the injury-in-fact test, made explicit in Data Processing, 1 94
was  to  ensure  that  standing  could  be  a simple,  threshold  determina-
tion,  without  an  elaborate  process  of assessing  the pleadings.  In  any
case, it would be strange and unfortunate  if jurisdictional issues turned
out to  rest on complex factual inquiries.  In this light, it might seem  to
make little sense to require plaintiffs  to purchase an airline ticket.  Per-
haps  this  is  unnecessary  formalism.  But the  Court's  point is  at least
one on which reasonable  people  can differ.  If we put the congressional
creation  of citizen suits to one  side,  and if the outcome in Lujan turns
on the fact that plaintiffs made an inadequate showing that they would
indeed  return  to  the  relevant  sites,  the  Court's  decision  is  hardly
implausible.

A trickier issue,  not dealt with in any of the opinions, involves  the
appropriate  characterization  of the  injury.  To  understand  the  point,
we need  to look  at a famous  case  that is seemingly  far afield.  Regents
of the  University of California v.  Bakke 195  presented  an  often-over-
looked problem of standing.  Bakke himself could not show that with-
out  the atfarmative  action program  he challenged,  he would have  been
admitted  to  the medical  school  of the University  of California  at Da-
vis.  It  was  therefore  argued  that  he  could  not  meet  the  Article  III
requirement  of injury  in  fact.

The  Court  responded  in  a  way  that  has  potentially  major

implications:

[E]ven  if Bakke had been  unable  to  prove  that he would  have been  ad-
mitted in the absence of the special program, it would not follow  that he
lacked  standing....  The trial  court  found  such  an  injury,  apart  from
failure  to  be  admitted,  in the University's  decision  not to  permit  Bakke
to  compete  for all  100 places  in the class,  simply because  of his race. 19 6
What happened  here  was that the Bakke  Court found injury,  cau-
sation,  and redressability by the simple doctrinal device  of recharacter-
izing the injury.  In Bakke, the Court described the injury  as involving
not  admission  to  medical  school  but  the  opportunity  to  compete  on
equal  terms.  The  Court  has  not  explicitly  used  this technique  in  any
other  case, 197  but it  might  easily  have  done  so.  In  Simon  v. Eastern
Kentucky  Welfare  Rights Organization [EKWROJ, for  example,  the

197.  But see  the housing discrimination  cases  discussed supra text accompanying  notes  125-
29.  The  idea that there was  redressability  there, in the ordinary  sense,  is  odd.  See Logan, supra

Michigan Law Review

[Vol.  91:163

Court  might  have  said  that  the  injury  consisted  not  of  a  refusal  of
admission  to  a  hospital,  but  instead  of  a  decision  not  to  permit  the
plaintiffs  to have  an opportunity  to be admitted  on the terms  specified
by  law,  simply  because  of unlawful  incentives  created  by  the IRS.198
In this way, Bakke and EKWRO were  structurally  similar.  Likewise,
in Allen  v.  Wright, 199 the Court might have  recharacterized  the injury
as  an  opportunity  not to  have  the desegregation  process  distorted  by
the incentives created through  the grant of unlawful  tax  deductions  to
private  schools.

Suppose  that,  in Lujan itself, the plaintiffs  had  claimed  that their
injury  consisted  not of an  inability  to  see  certain  species  but of a  di-
minished  opportunity to do  so.  This diminished opportunity allegedly
resulted from unlawful government  action.  On this view, the ESA  was
designed  to  ensure  not  that no  species  would  become  extinct -
that
was  not  an  adequate  description  of  the  injury  at  issue  - but  more
precisely  that  endangered  species  would  not  be  subject  to  increased
threats  of extinction  because  of federal  governmental  action.  The in-
jury  of which  the plaintiffs  complained  was  the harm  to  their profes-
sional  and  tourist opportunities  created  by  those increased  risks.

On  this  view,  the  injury  in Lujan would  therefore  run  parallel  to
that  created  by  violations  of the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  which  is
designed  not to  ensure that certain people  get into medical  school,  but
instead  that they are not subject to increased  risks of exclusion because
of racial  factors.  Structurally,  a  plausible  conception  of the  harm  in
Lujan would  accord  with that in Bakke -
a harm  to  an opportunity,
here  the opportunity  to  observe  certain  species.

If Bakke  is  right  on  the standing  question,  it is  not  so  easy  to  ex-
plain  why  the  same  approach  would  have  been  wrong  in Lujan.  If
there is a difference  between the relevant injuries,  it may  stem from the
fact  that the Equal Protection  Clause  conspicuously  protects  the  right
to  compete  on  an  equal  basis;  this  is  not a contestable  interpretation
(however  much  we  may  dispute  what  "equal"  means).  The  clause
does  not confer  the right  to  a  certain  set of favorable  outcomes.  The
ESA  is  far  more  ambiguous  on  this score.  Perhaps the injury  against
which  it guards  is  the actual loss  of an  endangered  species because  of
U.S.  government  action,  rather  than  the  diminished  opportunity  to
view  such  a  species  in  its natural  habitat.

But this  interpretation  is  far  from  clear.  Why  could  we not  view

note  15,  at  77-81.  The  Court  did not  require  ordinary  redressability  because  there  was  a clear
invasion  of a  statutory right  and  a clear  congressional  grant  of standing.  See id.

Standing After  Lujan

the ESA  as protecting  the right to  have the opportunity  to  see endan-
gered  species  unaffected  by  adverse  action  by  government  agencies?
Surely  Congress  has  the  constitutional  power  to  create  such  a  right.
But  courts may  wish to  avoid  this interpretation  in the absence  of an
especially  clear congressional  statement.  The recharacterization  of in-
juries to include less  particularized,  "opportunity"  harms does expand
the  category  of  people  entitled  to  bring  suit.  At  some  point  the
recharacterization  will  mean  that  all,  or  almost  all,  citizens  are
harmed  in the same way.  Prudential  considerations  might  well  coun-
sel  against  this  step.2°°

This  point  suggests  that,  when  Congress  has  not  spoken  clearly,
courts  should  not  allow  injuries  to  be  characterized  in  such  broad
terms that the plaintiff is not particularly affected.  But in Lujan, there
was  no  such problem.  The  plaintiffs  had a fully  plausible professional
and  educational  interest  in  the  species  at  issue.  If the  plaintiffs  had
tried to characterize  their injury as the diminished opportunity to pro-
mote their interests,  they should have  been permitted  to  do so.  There
is  little  law  on  this issue,  but perhaps  inventive  plaintiffs  will  be  per-
mitted  to  make  efforts  in  this  direction  in  the future.

I conclude that, as the case was litigated, the Court's conclusion on
injury  in fact was probably  incorrect, but plausible,  and in any case no
great  innovation.  Because  of the way  the case was litigated, there  was
no  occasion  to  think  hard  about  the  appropriate  characterization  of
the injury.  Thus  the implications  of Bakke  remain unclear.

The  third  problem  involves  the  notion  of  injury  in  fact.  I  have
suggested  that  whether  there  is  such  an  injury  turns  not  merely  on
facts but also on whether the law has recognized certain harms  as legal
ones.20 1  This  principle  means,  for  example,  that  a  person  in  New
York has no  standing to challenge  racial discrimination in Iowa,  as no
law  treats  distant  discrimination  as  an injury.  The same  result would
occur with a Lujan-style  action brought before  enactment  of the ESA.
But  now  suppose  that Congress  has  given to  all Americans  a  kind of
beneficial  legal  interest in the survival  of the Nile crocodile, at least in
the  sense  that it  has  granted  each  of us  a jointly held  property  right,
operating  against acts  of the U.S. government  that threaten to destroy
the  species.  Suppose  too  that  Congress  has  granted  every  American
the right to sue to vindicate that property right.  What in the Constitu-
tion forbids  this action?  Surely not the Due Process Clause;  surely not
Article  II;  and surely  not  Article  III.

standing  may undercut  rights  of those  most directly  affected).

Michigan Law Review

[Vol.  91:163

I suggest  that this is  very much  what  happened  in the ESA  itself.
By creating  citizen  standing, Congress  in  essence  created  the  relevant
property  interest  and allowed  citizens  to  vindicate  it.  To this  extent,
Congress  did indeed  create  the requisite injury  in  fact, and  the Court
should  have  recognized  it  as  such.  If a problem  remains,  perhaps  it
lies  in  Congress'  failure  to  be  explicit  on  the  point.  This  may  ulti-
mately be the meaning of Justice  Kennedy's concurring opinion,  and if
so it remains possible for Congress  to  solve the  problem  through more
careful  drafting.  I  discuss these  points  in  Part 111.202

2.  Redressability

On  the  question  of redressability,  there  was  no  majority  for  the
Court.  Three justices  saw no problem  with redressability;  two Justices
refused  to speak  to  the issue;  four Justices  found  a  constitutional  de-
fect.  Because  no majority spoke,  the Lujan case has little precedential
value  on  this question.

To  evaluate  the issue of redressability  in  the recent  cases,  it  is im-
portant  to  understand  why  courts  require  redressability  at  all.  The
basic  reason  is  akin  to  that  underlying  the  prohibition  on  advisory
opinions.  Let us  suppose that an injury  in fact  is required.  If a decree
in the plaintiff's favor will not remedy that injury, is not  such a  decree
an advisory  opinion,  at least with respect  to the plaintiff?  If the harm
to  the  plaintiff will  persist after  the decree,  why  should  the court  be-
come  involved  at  all?  For this  reason,  the  redressability  requirement
seems  to  be a reasonable  inference  from  the requirement  of injury  in
fact.  In  the abstract,  it makes  perfect  sense.

The  difficulty  arises  in  cases  in  which  Congress  has  attempted  to
restructure  administrative  and private  incentives  so as  to  bring  about
structural  or  systemic  change,  but in  a  way  that will  not necessarily
yield  the particular  outcomes  sought in particular  cases.  Assume, for
example,  that Congress  expressly  forbids  the grant  of federal  funds  to
international  projects that threaten  endangered  species.  If the agency
withholds  the funds,  no particular project will  necessarily be stopped,
nor will  any  particular  species  necessarily  be  saved.  The  project may
go  forward  without  American  participation,  or  the  species  may  not
survive  even  without  the project.  Or  suppose  that  Congress  forbids
universities  receiving  federal funds from  discriminating  on the basis  of
race.  If the funds  are withheld,  discrimination  may continue.  No pre-
diction  on  this score  can  avoid being  "speculative."

In cases  of this kind,  the relevant  harm  consists of a grant of funds

202.  See infra text  accompanying  notes  295-310.

November  1992]

Standing After Lujan

that makes certain  harms more  likely as a result of the contribution of
American  tax  dollars  -
the loss  of a species  or  the incidence  of dis-
crimination.  The  examples  illustrate  what  Congress  frequently  at-
tempts  to  do  in  the  areas  of  funding  requirements,  environmental
protection,  and risk regulation in general:  it attempts to change incen-
tives  in  a  way  that should  produce  aggregate  changes  without  neces-
sarily  affecting  outcomes  in particular  cases.  The  reduction  of sulfur
dioxide  emission  levels  in  California  will  reduce  the  risk  that  people
will  suffer from  respiratory  disease.  But it will  usually be speculative
in any  particular  case whether  the mandated reduction  will make  any
difference  to  a  particular human  life.

In such  cases, whether an injury is redressable depends on how  it is
characterized. If the injury is  described in sharply particularistic,  com-
mon law-like  terms,  it will not be redressable,  since the consequences
of victory for any particular plaintiff cannot be ascertained  in advance.
But if it is  characterized  as an  increased  risk  of harm  -
if that is  the
relevant injury -
it will certainly be redressed  by a decree in the plain-
tiff's favor.  A decision  to  require  compliance  with  national  ambient
air quality  standards  will make  the air cleaner,  and that will  decrease
the risk of harm to  people  in the relevant  territory.  Cases  of this  sort
are  a  staple  of modern  administrative  law.  Much  the  same  analysis
might  be  applied  to  a  decision  to  withdraw  funds  from  schools  that
discriminate  on  the basis  of race  or sex.

The  point  casts light  on Justice  Kennedy's  suggestion  that  courts
"must  be  sensitive  to  the articulation  of new  rights  of action that  do
not  have  clear  analogs  in  our  common-law  tradition. ' 20 3  Indeed,  in
these sorts of cases  it makes  little sense  to ask if a  decree in the plain-
tiff's  favor  will  remedy  a  common  law-like  injury.  The  question  is:
What is  the harm  that  Congress  sought  to  prevent?  To  answer  this
question, a court has to  engage in statutory interpretation.  In  the end,
the  issue  of  redressability,  like  that  of injury  in  fact,  turns  on  what
Congress  has provided.  Redressability  might even  be understood  as a
crude  proxy for  an  inquiry  into  legislative  instructions  about  who  is
entitled  to  bring  suit.

In Lujan, the harm Congress sought  to prevent would  indeed have
been  redressed  by  the decree.  The  alleged  violation  was  a  procedural
one  -
that is,  a failure  to  require  consultation  with the  Secretary  of
the Interior  on the fact that the project threatened an  endangered  spe-
cies.  If we  suppose  that  the  injury-in-fact  requirement  is  met,  the
redressability  issue poses no further obstacle.  If plaintiffs  were injured

203.  Lujan,  112  S. Ct.  at 2146  (Kennedy,  J.,  concurring).

Michigan Law Review

[V/ol.  91:163

by  the failure  to  consult,  then  a  decree  ordering  consultation  would
have  redressed  the harm.  Of course,  survival  of the endangered  spe-
cies  is not a necessary  consequence  of the requirement  to consult.  Per-
haps the agencies would  refuse to consult;  perhaps  removal  of funding
would  not affect  any  species.  But  none  of this is  relevant.  For  pur-
poses  of redressability,  a  requirement  of consultation  must  merely af-
fect incentives  in  the statutorily  required  way.

On this point, Lujan is self-contradictory,  and the internal  contra-
diction helps  show why  redressability  should  have  presented  no  prob-
lem.  The  Court acknowledged  (without  any  real explanation)  that in
some  cases  involving  procedural  violations,  plaintiffs  need  not  show
redressability.  The Court stated that "[t]his  is  not a case  where  plain-
tiffs  are  seeking  to  enforce  a  procedural  requirement  the disregard  of
which  could  impair  a  separate  concrete  interest  of theirs.  ..,204  and
added  in  a  crucial  footnote:  "The  person  who  has  been  accorded  a
procedural  right  to  protect  his  concrete interests  can  assert that  right
without  meeting  all  the  normal  standards  for  redressability  and
immediacy." 205

As noted,  the Court  did not explain  this conclusion;  I try to  do  so
below.20 6  But  if  plaintiffs  need  not  meet  the  normal  standards  for
redressability  for procedural  violations,  it follows  that plaintiffs  in Lu-
jan itself need  not  have  met the  normal  standards  for  redressability.
Indeed,  under  this  reasoning,  redressability  need  not  be  shown  in  a
wide  range  of  cases  in  which  a plaintiff  contends  that  the  executive
branch  has  failed  to  comply  with  a procedural  requirement  imposed
by  law.20 7

A contrary  conclusion  would produce  surprising results.  It would
mean  that Article  III  imposed  a constitutional  obstacle  to  most  ordi-
nary  administrative  law  cases.  In the  usual  case,  a  litigant  contends
that an  agency has failed to follow  some procedural requirement - by
holding  inadequate  hearings,  failing  to  give  notice,  meeting  with  pri-
vate people,  or attending  to a  statutorily irrelevant factor.  In  all such
cases,  it might well be said,  under  the apparent standard in Lujan, that
the redressability  requirement  has  not  been  met.  In  such  cases,  it is

entirely  "speculative"  whether  a decree  in  the  defendant's  favor  will
remedy  the  alleged  injury.  Lujan cannot  be  understood  to  say  that
these  conventional  cases  have  all  of a sudden  become  nonjusticiable.
I will  attempt  to sort out  these very  complex issues  below.20 8  For
the  moment,  we  should think  of redressability  as  a  crude  device  for
determining whether  Congress intended  to confer  a cause  of action.20 9
When  Congress has not spoken, the absence of redressability - under-
standing  the injury  in relatively  concrete,  personalized  terms  - may
argue  for the conclusion that the national legislature has not conferred
standing on  the plaintiff.  This  idea may  be part of the prudential no-
tion  that  standing  will  not  be  recognized  for  "generalized  griev-
ances."' 2 10  Certainly  courts  should  not recognize  standing  when  the
injury,  however characterized,  will not be redressed by  a decree  in the
plaintiff's favor.  As an independent  Article III requirement, however,
the  notion  of  redressability  makes  little  sense  in  the  cases  under
discussion.

3.  Citizen Suits

By  far  the most  important  and  novel  holding  in Lujan  was  that
Congress  cannot  grant  standing  to  citizens.  The  largest  conclusion,
also set out in Justice  Scalia's  1983 Suffolk Law Review  article, is  that
Article III  requires  a concrete,  particularized,  actual, or imminent  in-
jury in fact  that also satisfies  the causation  and redressability  require-
ments.  This  conclusion  rested  on  the Court's own  precedents,  on the
Take Care Clause, and on  a particular understanding  of Article  111.211
I take  these  in  order.

a.  Precedents.  The  Court  relied  on  two  sets  of  cases.  The  first,
from  the  1920s  and  1930s,  rejected  on  standing  grounds  some  odd
constitutional  challenges  to  governmental  decisions.  In  Fairchild v.
Hughes,21 2  the Court  dismissed  a  suit that challenged  the process  be-
hind  ratification  of the  Nineteenth  Amendment;  in  Massachusetts v.
Mellon,2 13  the Court did the same for a taxpayer  suit challenging  fed-

211.  The  Court  did not  address some  of the staples  of standing  law:  that injury  in  fact  as-
sures "concrete  adversariness";  that it guards  against collusive suits;  that it ensures that suits will
not  be hypothetical  or remote.  The  Court  was  wise  not  to  emphasize  these  points,  since  they
have  nothing to  do with  standing.  See Sunstein,  supra note  15,  at  1448.

eral  expenditures;  in Ex parte Levitt,2 14 the Court dismissed  an  action
challenging  Justice  Hugo  Black's appointment  to the  Supreme  Court.
None of these cases  involved a congressional  grant of standing.  All
involved  constitutional  claims.  Following  the discussion  in  Part  I, I
suggest  that all  of these  cases  are  best understood  as  attempts  to per-
suade  the Court to  create private  rights of action  under constitutional
provisions,  as  in  the  1971  case  of  Bivins  v.  Six  Unknown  Named
Agents. 2 15  In Bivins,  the  Court  concluded  that  the  Fourth  Amend-
ment  implicitly creates a private right  of action -
that is, it implicitly
authorizes  people  to  bring suit for damages  to  vindicate  their Fourth
Amendment rights. 21 6  But not every constitutional provision creates  a
private right of action.  It seems  especially  implausible to say that con-
stitutional  provisions create such rights when the relevant duty runs to
the public as  a whole rather than to affected  individuals.  Under tradi-
tional  standards,  a law  that  creates  a  duty  to  the general  public  does
not  give  rise to  privately  enforceable  rights.2 17

Fairchild, Mellon, and Ex parte Levitt should  be  seen  as  suits  at-
tempting  to  create  private rights  of action  under  constitutional  provi-
sions  that  did  not  contemplate  such  actions.  This  understanding
accords  with the language  of the opinions, which  indeed  suggests  that
the  relevant  constitutional  provisions  do  not  create  private  rights.
Hence  the words in Fairchild: "Plaintiff has  [asserted]  only the right,
possessed by every citizen, to require  that the Government be adminis-
tered  according  to law and that the public  moneys not be wasted.  Ob-
viously  this  general  right does  not  entitle  a  private citizen  to institute
in  the federal  courts  a suit  ....  ,,21 8

In  thinking  about  these  precedents,  we  may  go  a bit  further.  A
well-established  view holds  that courts  should  be reluctant  to  invoke
constitutional  provisions  as  a  check  on  democratic  processes. 2 19  Ex-
cept when  absolutely  necessary,  constitutional  adjudication  should be

because the Establishment Clause indeed provides a Bivins-type cause of action to restrain unlaw-
ful  expenditures.  Thus Justice Brennan's  dissenting opinion  in Valley  Forge Christian College v.

to  the right issue -

can be understood  as  an effort  to  ex-

'220

Ideas  of this  sort were  close  to  the  heart  of the jurisprudence  of
Justices  Brandeis  and  Frankfurter,  who  were,  as  we  have  seen,  the
central  figures behind  the  rise  of standing limitations.  However  con-
troversial  these ideas may be to some,2 2 1 they are fully intelligible.  But
there is a huge difference between  cases reflecting judicial reluctance  to
invoke  the Constitution to  challenge  legislative  outcomes and  cases in
which  Congress,  the  national  lawmaker,  has  explicitly  created  stand-
ing  so  as  to  ensure  bureaucratic  conformity  with democratic  will.

In the latter sort of case,  considerations  of democracy  support  the
grant of standing.  The democratic  process has produced  citizen stand-
ing, which  it  perceived  as  necessary  to  promote  compliance  with  the
democratic  will as  reflected  in  the governing  statute.  The  normal no-
tions  of  "passive  virtues"  have  no  role.  Hence  the  cases  from  the
1920s  and  1930s  seem  irrelevant  to  the issue  in Lujan.

The  second  set  of precedents  relied  on  in Lujan  consist  of  cases
from  the  1970s  and  1980s,  announcing  the  three  Article  III  require-
ments.  Some of these  cases  had  the same  form  as  the  cases  from  the
1920s and  1930s.  They  too involved  efforts  to  persuade  courts to cre-
ate  private  rights  of action under  constitutional  provisions.222  In the
other  cases,  the  Court was  not  dealing  with  an  express  congressional
grant of standing.  This is  a crucial  difference.  If standing depends  on
positive law,  decisions  denying  standing without  an  express  grant are
hardly  authority  for cases  with an  express  grant.  Indeed,  in  some  of
these cases the Court expressly  suggested that such a grant could make
a critical  difference.223

On the basis of all these  considerations,  it seems  clear that the re-
sult in Lujan has  no  firm support in the precedents.  The issue of citi-
zen  standing  had  never been  decided.

b.  Article II  and the Take Care Clause.  The Court's second argu-
ment  is that standing  limitations  for citizens  are necessary  in order to
protect  against  intrusions  on  the  President's  power  under  the  Take
Care Clause.224  This is  an extremely  important claim.  It links Justice

[Vol.  91:163

Scalia's Lujan opinion  with his  insistence  elsewhere  on  a  "unitary  ex-
ecutive,"  one that is free from interference  by others. 225  We may spec-
ulate that, on Justice Scalia's  view,  the notion  of a "unitary  executive"
equally forbids citizen suits that allow judicial intrusions on  the "Take
Care"  power  and  statutory  initiatives  that  remove  executive  power
from  the President  in favor  of independent  counsels.  But what  is  the
precise  relationship  between  standing  limitations  and  the President's
power  to  take  care that  the laws  be faithfully  executed?

From its text and history, it seems clear that  the Take Care  Clause
confers  both  a  duty  and  a  power 226  and  that  it  does  indeed  impose
limits  on  what  courts  can  do  to  the  bureaucracy.  The  Take  Care
Clause confers a power insofar as it grants to the President,  and no  one
else,  the authority  to oversee  the execution  of federal law.227  The pro-
vision  therefore  carries  implications  for the  perennial  question  of the
President's  power over  the administration.  It also  suggests  that over-
sight  of  bureaucratic  implementation  falls  to  the  President,  not  to
Congress  or the  courts.

But  the Take  Care Clause  confers  a  duty  insofar  as  it imposes  on
the President both a responsibility  to be faithful  to law  and an  obliga-
tion to enforce  the law  as it has been enacted,  rather than as he would
have wished it to be.  It is  for this reason  that the standard  administra-
tive law  case raises  no issue under the Take  Care Clause.  If an  object
of regulation  establishes  that  an  agency  has  enforced  the  law  in  an
unlawful way, the President  has violated his  duty under  the Take Care
Clause.  A judicial  decree  to  this effect  raises  no  problem  under  that
clause;  it merely  enforces  the constitutional  obligation in  the constitu-
tionally  authorized  way.

This  point is  not  limited  to cases  involving  regulated  objects.  If a
regulatory  beneficiary  with standing  persuades  a court  that  the Presi-
dent  is  violating  the law,  and the court  so holds,  there is  no  constitu-
tional  difficulty.  Imagine, for example,  that the plaintiffs  in Lujan had
purchased  their plane  tickets  and  made  plans to  leave for the relevant
countries  on a certain  date.  The Lujan Court acknowledged  that such
circumstances  would  give  rise  to  standing. 228  If  the  plaintiffs  pro-

ceeded  to  win  on  the merits,  no  problem would  arise under  the Take
Care  Clause.  A judicial  decision  for  the  plaintiffs  would  signal  that
the President  had  violated his  constitutional  command to  respect  and
enforce  the  ESA  as  enacted.

We  can  thus  conclude  that  the  Take  Care  Clause  poses  no
problems  in suits by regulated  objects, and also no problem in suits by
regulatory  beneficiaries,  even if they are  requiring the executive to  en-
force  certain  laws  against  his  will.  All of this  suggests  that the rela-
tionship  between  standing  limits and  the Take  Care  Clause is  at best
and in  the end,  I believe,  nonexistent.  If a  court  could
ambiguous  -
set aside executive  action at the behest of plaintiffs  with a plane ticket,
why  does the Take Care Clause  forbid it from  doing so at the behest of
plaintiffs  without a ticket?  Why  do  courts become  "virtually  continu-
ing monitors  of the wisdom  and  soundness  of Executive  action" 229  if
they hear  claims  of official  illegality  in  the second  class  of cases?

These questions  do  not establish that there  are no limits on stand-
ing.  But  they  do  raise  doubts  about  the  relevance  of the Take  Care
Clause.  In fact  they  suggest  that the clause,  however  relevant  it  may
be to many issues on administrative  law, is irrelevant to the question  of
standing.

-

Lujan seems to be built in key part on the idea that citizen standing
like other legislative interference with the President's power  to exe-
-
cute  the law230 
is  unacceptable  under Article  II.  Indeed,  many  of
the recent standing cases  might be thought to be Article  II cases  mas-
querading  under  the  guise  of Article  III;  we  may  even  say  that  the
Article  II  tail  is  wagging  the Article  III  dog.  But  the  conflation  of
Article  II  and Article  III  concerns  has  led  to  serious  confusion.  If a
plaintiff with a plane  ticket  can sue under the ESA without offense  to
Article II, then  it makes  no sense  to  say that Article  II is violated  if a
plaintiff lacking such a ticket initiates a proceeding.  Beneficiary  stand-
ing  poses  no  Article  II  issue.  The  two  articles  raise  quite  different
concerns;  they  should  be analyzed  separately.

The  Court's answer,  set out  in a brief passage,  appears  to  take  the
following  form.  It  is  one  thing  for  judges  to  protect  "individual
rights."  Courts  can  properly  engage  in  this  task,  which  is  uniquely
theirs.  But it is  another thing to  protect  "public  rights that have  been
legislatively  pronounced  to belong  to  each  individual  who  forms  part
of the  public. '2 31  In the  end,  however,  this  argument  seems  to  have

little  to  do  with  the Take  Care  Clause.  Instead,  it  must  rest  on  the
understanding  that Article III  places  a substantive  limitation  on what
sorts  of harms can  count as  legally  cognizable  injuries.

That  leaves  the  question  of  the  content  of  the  limitation.  If we
supplement  the cryptic passages  in Justice Scalia's Lujan opinion with
the fuller ones in Judge Scalia's Suffolk Law Review essay, we can  offer
some  speculation.  Perhaps individual  rights count  as  such only when
they  are  minority  rights  - when  they  are  not widely  shared.  I  will
return to this point below.2 32  For the moment let us explore the ques-
tion  of substantive  limits  on  congressional  power  to  create  causes  of
action.

c.  Article III. In the end the best defense  of Lujan must be that
Article III  allows  federal  courts  to  assume jurisdiction  only when  the
plaintiff has  a certain  sort of interest.  The  core  of the argument  ap-
pears  in Justice  Scalia's  1983  article:  Cases  involving  the requisite in-
terests  comport  with  "an  accurate  description  of the sort  of business
courts had  traditionally  entertained,  and hence  of the distinctive  busi-
ness  to which they were presumably to  be limited  under the Constitu-
tion. ' 233  The statement is surprisingly  casual.  No historical argument
is  offered for the claim about the traditional  "sort  of business."  More-
over,  the word  "presumably"  takes  the place  of a  complex  historical
argument.

As  a  matter  of  history,  we  have  seen  that  Scalia's  claim  is  not
sound;  in fact, it is baseless.  As discussed in Part I, courts had "tradi-
tionally  entertained"  a wide variety  of suits instituted  by  strangers. 234
Neither English nor American practice supports the view that stranger
suits are constitutionally impermissible.  There is no evidence  that Ar-
ticle  III was  designed to forbid  Congress from  entertaining  such suits.
On  the contrary, the practice  of the  early  Congress  -
freely  creating
the  qui  tam  and  informers'  action  without  a  hint  of  constitutional
doubt  -
suggests  that there were  no limits  on congressional  creation
of standing.

The  absence  of a firm basis  for Lujan in  constitutional  text  or his-
tory should  probably  be decisive  against the Court's reasoning.  If the
text and history are  compatible with what Congress  has done in creat-
ing citizen  suits,  courts  have  no warrant  to  intervene.  To  reach  this
conclusion,  it is  not  necessary  to linger  over  Justice Scalia's  more  ab-
stract  and  speculative  argument  about  the  appropriate  role  of  the

courts  in a democracy,  an  argument that stems  from  political  theory.
But because  that argument is obviously  influencing the development  of
standing  principles  in  the Supreme  Court  and  elsewhere,  it is  worth-
while to  address  the argument  here.

C.  Detour L  Justice Scalia's Conception of Standing

In his  1983 essay, Justice Scalia argued that "courts  need to accord
greater  weight  than  they  have  in  recent  times  to  the  traditional  re-
quirement  that  the  plaintiff's  alleged  injury  be  a  particularized  one,
which  sets  him apart  from the  citizenry  at large. '235  Scalia  acknowl-
edged  that this was "not a linguistically inevitable conclusion." 2 36  The
text of Article III  does not  suggest that a personal  injury is necessary.
But in  his  key statement,  discussed  above,  Scalia defended  the limita-
tion  on  grounds  of tradition.2 37

Scalia  explicitly  claimed that "there is  a limit upon  even the power
of Congress  to  convert  generalized  benefits  into  legal  rights  -
and
that  is  the limitation  imposed  by  the  so-called  'core'  requirement  of
standing. ' 238  A  central  concern  is  what  Scalia  describes  the  recent
rise of the courts as "equal  partners"  with  the legislative and executive
branches.  In his  view,  this unfortunate  development  is  related  to  the
law  of  standing.  Thus  Scalia  suggests  that  "[tihe  sine  qua  non  for
emergence  of  the  courts  as  an  equal  partner  with  the  executive  and
legislative branches  in the formulation  of public policy was  the assur-
ance  of prompt  access  to  the courts  by those  interested  in  conducting
the  debate. ' 239  Unlimited  standing  gave  people  this  prompt  access,
thus impairing  the system  of separation  of powers  in two  ways:  first,
by  providing  more  occasions  for judicial  review  of  executive  action;
second,  by  changing the  timing of that review.

The  core  of Scalia's  argument,  however,  lies  elsewhere.
[Tihe  law  of standing  roughly  restricts  courts  to  their  traditional  un-
democratic  role  of protecting  individuals  and minorities  against imposi-
them  from  the  even  more
tions  of  the  majority,  and  excludes 
undemocratic  role  of  prescribing  how  the  other  two  branches  should
function  in  order to  serve  the interest  of the  majority  itself.24 °

It is  through this  lens  that  Scalia  offers  the distinction  with which  I
began this article.  In  the first class  of cases,  "an  individual  who  is the

very object of a law's requirement  or prohibition seeks to  challenge it";
here,  standing  is  simple.  In  the  second  class,  "the  plaintiff  is  com-
plaining  of an  agency's  unlawful failure to  impose  a  requirement  or
prohibition  upon  someone  else";  here  the  harm  is  "a  majoritarian
one." 24 1

The  central  point  in  the analysis  is  that
[u]less  the plaintiff can  show some respect in which  he is  harmed  more
than the rest of us ...  he has not established  any basis  for concern  that
the  majority  is  suppressing  or  ignoring  the  rights  of  a  minority  that
wants protection,  and thus  has  not established  the prerequisite  for judi-
cial  intervention. 242

Thus,  the "doctrine  of standing...  is an essential  means  of restricting
the  courts  to  their  assigned  role  of protecting  minority  rather  than
majority interests. ' 243  Scalia  urged that judges had been  assigned  this
role by the Constitution, and also that the other role -
the protection
of majority  interests - would  be poorly  executed  by judges.

After all, judges  are removed  from  political  accountability  and se-

lected  from  a  highly  educated  elite.  This situation

is  just  perfect  for  a  body  that  is  supposed  to  protect  the  individual
against  the people;  it  is just  terrible (unless  you  are  a monarchist)  for a
group that is supposed to decide what  is good for the people.  Where  the
courts,  in  the  supposed  interest  of all  the  people,  do  enforce  upon  the
executive  branch  adherence  to  legislative  policies  that the political  pro-
cess  itself would  not  enforce,  they are  likely  (despite  the best  of inten-
tions)  to  be enforcing  the  political  prejudices  of their  own  class.244

Scalia  was  alert  to  the concern  that,  without  broad  standing  for
beneficiaries, 
legislative  enactments  would  be  unlawfully  under-
enforced within the bureaucracy.  Indeed, he noted that  statutes might
get "lost  or misdirected"  in the executive  branch; furthermore,  he ad-
mitted that this was indeed the consequence  of his proposal. 245  But -
this is "a good  thing. ' 246
and this is the article's striking conclusion -
Executive  nonimplementation  of statutes  is part  of a well-functioning
democratic process,  keeping law current  with existing views.  "Yester-
day's  herald  is today's  bore." 24 7

This is a provocative  and arresting  argument,  made  in  short com-
pass.  But  it  faces  several  difficulties.  One  problem  is  that  the argu-

ment  is  strikingly  ahistorical.  The  article  does  not  address  the

III.  As  we  have  seen,  there  is  no  evidence  that  they  did.  There  is
considerable  evidence  to  the  contrary.

A  second  problem  is  that  the  approach  seems  inconsistent  with
some  of the  most  prominent  aspects  of Justice  Scalia's  own jurispru-
dence.  Justice  Scalia  usually  insists that judges  should  read  constitu-
tional  provisions  at a low  level  of generality  and  avoid  infusing  them
with broad  "values"  of their  own.  In  his  view,  such  impositions  in-
crease  the occasions  for judicial  invalidation  of legislation.2 48  In this
case,  however, Scalia reads Article III broadly,  invests it with general,
controversial  values,  and ultimately  recommends judicial  invalidation
of  the  outcomes  of  democratic  processes.  The  theory  of  "minority
rights"  is  after  all  a  controversial  theory  of democracy,  counselling
courts  to  act in  some cases  but not  in others.  Let us  assume that the
argument is plausible,  as it indeed appears  to be.  Should even a plausi-
ble  theory  of this kind be invoked  in  order to  invalidate  a law  that is
not inconsistent  with the text and  history  of the  Constitution?

There  is  a  further  problem.  In  a  case  of  beneficiary  or  citizen
standing, courts are not enforcing  "executive  branch adherence  to leg-
islative policies  that the political  process  itself would  not enforce. '249
Instead,  they are  requiring  the executive branch  to  adhere  to the law,
that is, to  outcomes that the political process  has  endorsed.  In Lujan,
for  example,  the  plaintiffs  would  have  won  only  if they  could  have
shown  an  unambiguous  legislative judgment  in their  favor.250  Stand-
ing would  produce  "legislative  policies  that the political  process  itself
would not enforce" 25 1 only if courts systematically  misinterpreted stat-
utes.  But this  seems  to  be an  unsupportable  assumption.

In  addition,  it  is  hardly  a  good  thing  if agency  implementation
defeats legislative judgments.  Suppose, for example, that the EPA de-
cided  that statutes calling  for  a form  of cost-benefit  balancing  should
be construed  not to  allow  consideration of costs, and thus to require  a
kind of environmental  absolutism.  Would  it  be plausible  to  say  that
this is "a  good  thing,"  so  long as  the agency,  supervised  as it is by  the
President,  had  so  concluded?  Surely  not.  Agency  rejection  of  con-

gressional  enactments,  even  if motivated  by  the President  himself, is
inconsistent  with the  system of separation  of powers.

There are  of course important  political  constraints  on administra-
tive behavior,  and an understanding  of those  constraints  is  a valuable
part of administrative law.252  Moreover, the power of the executive  to
temper  legislative  enactments  is  indeed an  important  aspect  of demo-
cratic  government.  The  President  can  appropriately  exercise  this
power in many areas, including prosecutorial discretion,  interpretation
of  ambiguities,  incremental  policymaking,  and  not-so-incremental
judgments  when Congress  has spoken ambiguously.  But the executive
is  not  normally  empowered  to  violate  the  law  through  enforcement
activity  in violation  of the boundaries  set by  Congress.  Justice  Scalia
cannot be taken  to argue in favor of the "updating"  that occurs  when
the  President implements  a law  in such  a way  as  to rewrite  it.

To bring  this problem  closer to the standing issue,  suppose that an
agency  decides  that the ESA should not be applied to American activi-
ties in foreign nations, when in fact  Congress plainly intended  that the
ESA should apply  abroad.  Is this a good  thing?  On the contrary,  it is
a  violation  of democratic  aspirations  and  (more  relevant  still)  of the
system  for national  lawmaking set up by Articles I and  II of the Con-
stitution.  If agency  enforcement beyond  that intended  by  Congress is
not "a  good thing,"  even where the agency responds  to  political pres-
sures, it is not "a good thing"  where an agency undertakes  a pattern of
enforcement  that  violates  congressional  will  through  abdication  or
failure  to act.  Asymmetry  on  this point  would  simply  translate  judi-
cial  antipathy  to regulation  into  administrative  law.  The  foreclosure
of standing  cannot  plausibly  be  defended  as  a  means  of allowing  the
bureaucracy  to implement  the law  in a manner  that conflicts  with the
governing  statute.

Let us  turn, finally,  to Justice  Scalia's  argument  from  democratic
theory, referred to briefly in Lujan itself.253  That  argument rests  on a
distinction  between  minority  and  majority  interests.  The  distinction
between  regulatory  objects  and  regulatory  beneficiaries,  for purposes
of standing, is  said to rest on this  prior distinction, which  is itself said
to be well  adapted  to the  special  role of courts  in  the American  legal
system.  "Objects"  represent  a minority  whose  interests  require judi-
cial  protection;  "beneficiaries"  represent  a  majority  who  can  protect
their  concerns  through  the  political  process.  But  there  are  two
problems  with  this  argument.  The  first  is  that  it  does  not justify  a

Standing After  Lujan

distinction  between  the  objects  and  beneficiaries  of regulation.  The
second is that it turns on an inadequate  conception  of the workings of
American  democracy.

Suppose  we agreed  that  courts  should  not protect  majority  inter-
ests  through  administrative  law.  The  result  would  be  to jeopardize
standing  for  many  objects  of regulation,  not merely  for beneficiaries.
Often the objects of regulation  are indeed majority interests.  A regula-
tion  might, for  example,  affect  a large  number  of companies  at  once,
and in the process  impose  costs principally  on consumers, which is  to
say on nearly all of us.  Majorities are affected  even when  "objects"  are
at  risk.  But  objects  are  not  therefore  to  be  deprived  of standing,  at
least  not  without  wreaking  havoc  on  traditional  administrative  law.
Indeed,  the objects of regulation  are not systematically  more likely to
be  "majorities"  than  the beneficiaries.  If we  were to build  our theory
of standing on majority status, we must rethink standing in important
ways - but not in the ways  recommended  by Justice Scalia.  The  ma-
jority-minority  distinction is too  crude a basis for distinguishing  bene-
ficiaries  from  objects.

Now  let us  turn to  the workings  of American  democracy.  Justice
Scalia's  argument  seems to be that courts  are well-suited to  protecting
minorities,  which  cannot  protect  themselves  through the  democratic
process, whereas  they are in poor position to protect  majorities, whose
natural  forum  is  the  democratic  process.  The  politically  responsive
institution is  in  turn the  executive branch.

But  this  argument  is  too  simple.  Some  minorities  are  especially
well-organized  and  do  indeed  have  access  to  the political  process,  in-
cluding  the  executive  branch.  The  point  is  well  documented. 254  At
least  sometimes,  regulated  industries  are  a prominent  example.  But
they  are  not  therefore  to  be deprived  of standing.

Moreover,  some  majorities  are  so  diffuse  and  ill-organized  that
they  face systematic  transaction costs  barriers  to the exercise  of ongo-
ing  political  influence.  This  point  is  well  documented  in  the  area  of
environmental  protection  and  elsewhere.25 5  The  citizen  suit  is
designed as a corrective. 256  Essentially, this cause of action reflects the
congressional  judgment that some interests,  including those of majori-
ties,  are  so  diffuse  and  unorganized  that they  require judicial  protec-
tion in  the implementation  process.  Congress' judgment  to  this  effect

receives  distinguished support from a significant body of empirical  and
analytic literature.2 57  Even  if judges do  not agree with  that judgment,
they  sh6uld  not  foreclose  the  cause  of  action  in  the  name  of  the
Constitution.

I conclude  that Justice Scalia's  essay does  not justify  the view that
Article  III  forbids the citizen  suit.  If Congress  has  chosen  to  rely  on
the citizen  suit,  courts  should  not foreclose  that  choice.

D.  Detour 11.  The  Citizen Suit and the Administrative State

To make  a full evaluation  of Lujan, a good empirical picture  of the
citizen  suit would  be valuable.  What  effect does  the citizen  suit have
on  the real  world?  Is it  a valuable  instrument  of environmental  and
regulatory  policy?  How many  citizen  suits have merit?  Does the citi-
zen suit produce  greater compliance  with the law  or better regulatory
policy?  In how  many  cases does  the citizen  suit facilitate  standing,  or
simplify  standing issues,  compared to a  requirement  of injury  in fact?
The  answers  to  such  questions  may  not  help  with the  constitutional
issue.  But  they  will  aid  in  an  assessment  of whether  the  demise  of
citizen  suits  is  an important  event  for administrative  law.

Unfortunately,  we  have  only  the most  preliminary  of answers  to
these  questions.  In  the  early  period  of the citizen  suit,  exceptionally
few  plaintiffs  filed  such actions. 2 58  Advocates  of this form  of enforce-
ment  were  both surprised and  greatly  disappointed.  But recent years,
starting  with  1983,  have  seen  greater  activity,  especially  under  the
Clean  Water  Act.259  Between  1984  and  1988  (when  the EPA  ceased
collecting  data  on citizen  suits),  there  were  over  800 notices  of intent
to sue under that Act.26°  The government  was the defendant  in  165  of
these  suits.  Plaintiffs  have  won  a large  number of citizen  cases  under
the  Clean  Water  Act.26 1  Indeed,  plaintiffs  readily  prevail  under  the

Clean Water Act, apparently because  some of the statutory provisions
speak  quite plainly  and mandate  unambiguous  action. 262

Post-Lujan, most  environmental  suits  will  be  able  to  go  forward
under the injury-in-fact requirements.  An environmental  organization
will typically be able to find a member who  has the requisite injury.263
But  the need  to  show  an  injury  will  complicate  such  suits,  and some
occasions  will arise when no plaintiff can be found.  Moreover,  regula-
tory  cases  will  arise  in  which  the  insistence  on  an  actual  injury,  as
understood  in Lujan, will bar  the action altogether.  I discuss this pos-
sibility in  Part III.

There  is  good  reason  to  believe  that  the  citizen  suit  has  indeed
helped  bring  about  greater  administrative  compliance  with law.  But
there  is no  reason to think that the citizen suit is a fundamental part of
modem  regulatory  reform.  I  offer  a  brief  account  of  a  long  story
here.264

In its current  form, the citizen suit should  be seen  as part and par-
cel  of a largely  unsuccessful  system  of command-and-control  regula-
tion.  Under  this  system,  Congress  entrusts  agencies  with  the job  of
issuing a massive number  of highly  centralized, rigid,  and often draco-
nian  regulatory  requirements.  It should  be  no  surprise  that agencies
are often unable to undertake  their legally required tasks, especially  in
view  of the fact that they infrequently receive  the necessary resources.
The  citizen  suit is  part  of a  complex  system  in  which  Congress  dele-
gates  difficult  or  even  impossible  tasks,  appropriates  inadequate  re-
sources,  imposes  firm  and  sometimes  unrealistic  deadlines, 265  and
enlists courts and citizens in order to produce  compliance. 266  The sys-
tem  may well  find  explanation  in  terms  of the  self-interest  of elected
representatives. 267  Credit-claiming  for  apparently  aggressive  regula-

tion can coexist with a range of real-world loopholes,  helping  industry
to  escape from  government  controls.  But the public is often the loser.
In these circumstances,  the citizen  suit is probably best understood
as  a  band-aid  superimposed  on  a  system  that  can  meet  with  only
mixed  success.  Instead  of band-aids,  modem  regulation  requires  fun-
damental reform.  Congress  should  replace  the command-and-control
system with more flexible, incentive-oriented  measures. 268  Instead  of a
continuing  emphasis  on judicial  review,  modem  bureaucracy  needs
large-scale  shifts  introduced  and  implemented  by  legislators  and  ad-
ministrators  themselves. 269  We  should not, however, forget that band-
aids  can  do  some  good.  The  citizen  suit  may  serve  as  an  effective  if
partial  alternative  to  massive  regulatory  overhaul.  In  any  case,  the
complex  policy issues  do not bear on the interpretation  of Article  III.

E.  Coda:  What the Court Should Have Said

From what has  been said thus far,  we can  offer  some brief general
words  about  the  law  of  standing  and  Lujan  itself.  With  respect  to
standing  in  general,  the  key  question  is  whether  Congress  (or  some
other relevant  source of law) has  created a cause  of action.  Without  a
cause  of action,  there  is no  standing;  there  is  no  case  or controversy;
and  courts  are  without authority  to  hear  the case  under  Article  III.

This point suggests that the real source of current difficulty  is Data
Processing, which  diverted  attention  from  the  relevant  question  of
cause  of action  to the irrelevant  question  of injury  in fact.  So  long as
injury in fact was thought to be the issue that Congress  itself had made
relevant  under  the APA, the difficulty  was  only minor.  But  when  an
injury  in  fact  became  both  a  necessary  and  sufficient  condition  for
standing,  the area  grew  badly  confused.

The  result  was  that  courts  began  to  grant  standing  in  cases  in
which  it  should  have  been  denied,  and  to  deny  standing  in  cases  in
which  it  should  have  been  granted. 270  Worse,  the  Court  viewed  the

EcON.  & ORGANIZATION  59  (1992)  (discussing  the symbiotic  relationship  between  legislators
and environmental  groups).

268.  See  SuNsTIN,  supra note  162,  ch.  3;  Bruce  A. Ackerman  & Richard  B.  Stewart,  Re-
forming Environmental Law:  The Democratic Case for Market Incentives, 13  COLUM.  J. ENvrL.
L.  171  (1988);  Sunstein,  supra note  137.

269.  This  is  the lesson  of such  diverse  works  as  ACKERMAN  & HASSLER,  supra note  264;
JERRY L.  MASHAW  &  DAVID  L.  HARFST,  THE  STRUGGLE  FOR AUTO  SAFETY  (1990);  Acker-
man  & Stewart,  supra note 268;  Melnick,  supra note  161;  Peter  L.  Strauss, Revisiting Overton
Park:  Political and Judicial Controls Over Administrative Actions Affecting  the Community, 39
UCLA L.  REV.  1251  (1992).

270.  Thus,  for example,  the court granted standing  in United States  v. SCRAP,  412 U.S.  669
(1973),  an environmental  case in  which the law student  plaintiffs  could not  easily show a cause of
action  conferred  by  Congress.  Standing  should  almost  certainly  have  been  denied  in  SCRAP,
even if an  injury in  fact  might have  been  found.

Standing After  Lujan

standing  issue  through  the  wrong  lens.  An  injury  in  fact  is  not  re-
quired by Article  III, and it is  not sufficient  for standing.27 1  Both his-
tory and principle show  that people with "injuries in fact"  may or may
not have  standing.  The  question  is whether  Congress  has  conferred  a
right  to bring  suit.

Under  this view  of the matter, Lujan was  a relatively  simple case.
The  first  question  was  one  of  positive  law:  whether  Congress  had
granted  or denied  standing to  the plaintiffs.  Congress'  grant of stand-
ing resolved  that issue.  The grant created the relevant injury  for Arti-
cle  III  purposes.  There  was  no need  to  start with  injury  in  fact  and
redressability,  or  even  to  address  these  issues  at all.  And if it  should
be  thought  -
contrary  to  the  view  presented  here -
that  there  are
some  Article III  limits on legislative power  to  confer  causes  of action
on citizens,  those limits  surely  were not reached  in Lujan.  This was,
after all,  a case in which  the plaintiffs  claimed  an intention  to  go to  a
place  where  allegedly  unlawful  government  expenditures  placed  en-
dangered  species  at risk.  The  Constitution  did  not forbid  that action
from  going  forward.  The  Lujan  Court  should  not  have  discussed
redressability;  the  congressional  grant  of standing  disposed  of the is-
sue.  If redressability was relevant,  the Court should have said that the
injury  created  by  Congress  -
to  prevent  the  U.S.  government  from
threatening  to  produce  extinction  - would  indeed  have  been  re-
dressed  by  a  decree  in the plaintiffs'  favor.272

III.  THE FUTURE

Lujan  settled  some  important  questions.  But  it  left  many  issues
open,  and it raised at least as many new  ones.  The future looks partic-
ularly  murky  in light of Justice  Kennedy's  concurring  opinion,  which
refused to join  the plurality  on redressability,  questioned  any focus  on
the common  law  as the exclusive  source  of injury,  and suggested  rela-
tively  broad  congressional  power  on  the 
issues  of  injury  and
causation. 273

In  this Part,  I outline the settled  and unsettled  issues.  I also sug-
gest  how some  of the  current  puzzles  should  be  resolved.  The  most
important  conclusions  involve possible congressional  responses  to Lu-
Jan.  I suggest  that the simplest  and most  effective  response  would be
the creation of a bounty for successful  citizen plaintiffs.  Such a bounty

[Vol.  91:163

would  build  directly  on  the  qui  tam  and  informers'  actions,  and  it
should  not  raise  a constitutional  problem  in  the aftermath  of Lujan.
A more complex  response would  be for Congress expressly  to  cre-
ate a property  interest in the various regulatory  "goods"  that it wants
to authorize  citizens  to  protect.  It might,  for example,  say  that  citi-
zens  generally  have  a beneficial  interest in  certain  endangered  species
that are at risk  from acts  of the U.S. government.  This somewhat  ad-
venturous strategy  would have the advantages  of building on common
law notions  of interest and injury and of forcing focused  congressional
attention  on  the  precise  nature  of the rights  at  stake.  It would  also
respond  to  some  of the  concerns  in  Justice  Kennedy's  concurrence.
Despite  its  relative  novelty,  an  approach  of this  sort  should  also  be
constitutional.

A.  Easy Cases:  What Lujan Permits

The  Lujan  opinion  does  not  reject  a  number  of  cases  in  which
courts  have  given  standing  to  environmental  plaintiffs.  On  the con-
trary, it expressly  endorses  many such cases,  even  when the plaintiff is
complaining  that the executive has  taken inadequate  action to  enforce
the  law.  To  this  extent,  the  invalidation  of the  citizen  suit  allows  a
good deal of room for private litigants -
to
initiate  proceedings  against  the executive  branch.  The  case  therefore
introduces  some  uncertainty  into  the  law,  but  it  probably  does  not
work any  fundamental  shift  in the  environmental  area.

regulatory beneficiaries  -

The  Court thus makes  clear  that, if an environmental  plaintiff can
show  that its members  use the particular environmental  resource  that
is  at risk,  standing is  available.  It follows,  for example,  that  a citizen
in New  York could, post-Lujan, complain  about the failure  to enforce
clean  air or  clean  water  requirements  in  New  York.  The  Court sug-
gests as  much by invoking  the Japan Whaling case274 to  show that an
environmental  organization  could  complain  of  excessive  whale  har-
vesting  when  the  "whale  watching  and  studying  of  their  members
w[ould]  be adversely  affected  by  continued  whale  harvesting. ' 275  The
Court  also  says  that a  citizens'  council  has  standing  to  bring  suit  to
challenge  environmentally  harmful construction  in  the area where  its
members  live.276

It  also  remains  clear  that  some  procedural  injuries  can  produce

standing under  Article  III.  The  Court writes:

This  is  not  a case  where  plaintiffs  are  seeking  to  enforce  a  procedural
requirement  the  disregard of which  could impair a separate  concrete  in-
terest  of theirs  (ag.,  the  procedural  requirement  for  a hearing  prior to

next door  to  them).2 7 7

A citizen can thus complain about a failure  to prepare an environmen-
tal impact statement (EIS) even though  it is "speculative"  whether the
statement  will  cause  the project  to be  abandoned.278

Standing  remains  available  in  all  cases  under  the  National  Envi-
ronmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA)279  whenever  plaintiffs  can  show  that
the project, if completed,  would adversely affect their interests.  A con-
crete injury of this kind is sufficient even  if ordinary redressability  can-
not be shown.  "The person who  has been accorded  a procedural  right
to  protect  his concrete  interests  can  assert that right  without meeting
all  the normal  standards for  redressability  and  immediacy. 2 80

It is  clear that the Court believes this;  but, as noted above, it is not
clear  why  the  Court  does  so.  If Article  III  requires  redressability,
most NEPA  suits indeed  seem unconstitutional.  In  the typical NEPA
action,  there  is  no  assurance  that  completion  of  an  adequate  EIS
would  have  any  consequence  at  all for the  plaintiffs.  One  might  well
think,  as the government  urged  in Lujan, that NEPA  suits frequently
violate  Article  III.

But  as the Lujan Court appears  to acknowledge,  this  would be an
odd and far-reaching conclusion.  It is almost always the case that pro-
cedural  rights  have  only  speculative  consequences  for  a litigant.  If a
judge  is  found  to  have  ruled  in  favor  of party  A  after  taking  a  bribe
from party A,  it remains speculative  whether an unbiased judge would
have  ruled  for  party  B.  Does  party  B  therefore  lack  standing?  Or
suppose  that an administrator  is  found to  have  violated  the Adminis-
trative  Procedure  Act by promulgating  a regulation  without first  pub-
lishing  it  for  comment  in  the  Federal  Register.  It  is  entirely
speculative  whether  compliance  would  make  any  difference  to  the
complainants.  The  Lujan Court, however,  does  not  want  the redres-
sability  requirement  to  bar  standing in  such  cases.

Perhaps  the Court is  endorsing  Justice  Kennedy's  suggestion  that

"Congress  has  the  power  to  define  injuries  and  articulate  chains  of
causation  that  will  give  rise  to  a  case  or controversy  where  none  ex-
isted  before. ' 281  More deeply,  however,  I think that the Court's con-
clusion  on  this  point  exemplifies  several  of  the  problems  associated
with the whole notion  of redressability.  A procedural  right is created,
not  because  it  necessarily  yields  particular  outcomes,  but  because  it
structures  incentives  and  creates  pressures  that Congress  has  deemed
important  to  effective  regulation.  The  same  is  true  for  the  sorts  of
interests  at  stake  in the  ESA  and  in many  other  environmental  stat-
utes.  Congress is attempting not to dictate outcomes but to create pro-
cedural  guarantees  that  will  produce  certain  regulatory  incentives.
Redressability  in  the conventional  sense  is  irrelevant.

This point  might well  have  arisen  in Lujan itself.  Even  though  it
did not, the opinion makes  clear  that procedural  harms remain  cogni-
zable  when  ordinary  injuries  are  involved,  despite  the  absence  of
redressability.

B.  Easy Cases:  What Lujan Forecloses

Thus  far  I  have  explained  the  types  of  suits  Lujan has  left  un-
touched.  But  it is  equally  clear  that Lujan forecloses  "pure"  citizen
suits.  In these suits, a stranger with an ideological  or law-enforcement
interest  initiates  a  proceeding  against  the  government,  seeking  to  re-
quire  an agency to undertake action of the sort required by law.  Many
environmental  statutes  now  allow  such  actions,  and  plaintiffs  have
brought  many  suits  of this kind.  Under Lujan, these  suits  are  unac-
ceptable.  Congress must at a minimum  "identify  the injury it seeks to
vindicate  and relate  the injury  to  the class  of persons  entitled  to bring
suit. '2 82  If Congress  has  simply  given  standing to  citizens, 283 this  re-
quirement  has  not been  met.  The  plaintiff must  point  to  a  concrete
injury,  not merely  to  a  congressional  grant  of standing.

C.  Injury in Fact?

The discussion  thus far has  focused to  a large  extent on  changes  in
the law of injury in fact.  Lujan extends this change, placing a renewed
emphasis  on  the  notion  that  the  harm  must  be  imminent  and  non-
speculative.  This requirement will likely carry more weight than it has
in the past.  Before Lujan, requiring  people  to  obtain  a plane  ticket  or
to  make  firm  plans  to  visit  the  habitat  of  endangered  species  might

well have been unnecessarily  formalistic.  Now such actions are appar-
ently required.  But this is  not a fundamental  revision of previous  law.
The  celebrated SCRAP case284  is probably  a relic.  But  on that point,
the handwriting  had been  on the wall  a long  time, and,  if the analysis
thus  far is  correct,  there  is  no reason  to mourn  for SCRAP, in  which
Congress  had  not  conferred  a right  to bring  suit.

Harder questions could arise in consumer  cases, which play a large
role  in  contemporary  administrative  law.  Suppose,  for example,  that
the  government  imposes  on  automobile  manufacturers  fuel  economy
requirements  that  are  less  stringent  than  the  law  requires. 28 5  Typi-
cally,  plaintiffs  will  argue  that  their  injury  consists  of  a  diminished
opportunity  to  purchase  the  products  in  question.286  After  Lujan,
standing becomes  a  difficult  issue  in  such  cases.  A  court might  find
that the plaintiffs  lack a concrete  or particularized  interest.  They  are
perhaps not readily  distinguished from the public  at large.  There is an
issue about speculativeness  as well:  perhaps the relationship  between a
consumer  and  a  product  that  he  allegedly  wants  is  the same  as  the
relationship between the Lujan plaintiffs and an endangered species,  in
the sense that in  neither  case  is it clear  that the injury will  occur  as  a
result of the complained-of  government  acts.

A  consumer  case  of this  sort may  differ  from Lujan, however,  in
the important  sense  that  a  consumer  who  complains  of a  diminished
opportunity  to  purchase  a product  can  very  plausibly  claim  that he
will in fact purchase that product.  This claim is probably less specula-
tive  than  that in  Lujan.  It is  possible  to  discount  an  "intention"  to
undertake  difficult  foreign  travel  at an  unspecified  time;  the intention
may  not  show  sufficient  likelihood  of harm.  But  it is  harder  to  dis-
count  an intention  to purchase  a specified  product,  which  usually  ap-
plies  to  a single,  simple  transaction.  The distinction  suggests  that, at
least as Lujan stands,  it does  not significantly  affect  the standard  con-
sumers'  action.  In  the automobile  case,  the key  point  is  that a more-
or-less sharply defined  category  of consumers  is distinctly affected  in a

standing. 287

which  listeners  or  viewers  in  a  defined  area,  or  of defined  program-
ming,  challenge  an  FCC  decision  that  bears  on  their  programming
choices. 288  If the  FCC  refuses  to  license  a  classical  music  station,
there  is  a  concrete  injury,  and  it  is  sufficiently  particularized  under
Lujan.  The intention  to listen  to  a  station is not as  conjectural  as the
travel  intention  at  issue in Lujan.

Greater  difficulties  may arise in some  similar  actions,  as  when, for
example,  consumers  challenge  an  FDA  or  EPA  regulation  allowing
carcinogens  to  be  added  to  food. 289  There  may  be  serious  standing
problems in such cases.  A person complaining  about such a regulation
might  be  said  to  be  suffering  an  injury  that  is  speculative  or  genera-
lized.  This  is especially  likely  insofar as the injury  is  characterized  as
an  actual  incidence  of cancer.  It is  extremely  speculative  to  suggest
that  the  introduction  of  carcinogenic  substances  into  food  additives
will  produce  cancer in  particular  human beings.

The issue becomes  harder if the injury is  characterized  as  a greater
risk  of cancer.  In  that event,  the  injury  is  less  speculative;  but it  is
unclear  that  it  is  sufficiently  particularized.  On  Justice  Kennedy's
view, there is probably  enough for standing, for he insisted that stand-
ing can  exist even  if the injury is very widely shared. 290  This is indeed
the  correct  view,  because  it  is  the  most  plausible  conception  of the
injury  that Congress  sought  to  prevent.29 1  But the issue is  now  open.

D.  Redressability

Because  only  four  justices  concluded  that  the  redressability  re-
quirement had  not been met in Lujan, the case probably  offers no real
lessons  on that  issue.  After Lujan, the  law  of redressability  thus  re-
mains as it was before:  Extremely fuzzy  and highly manipulable.  It is
manipulable,  first, because  there  is no  clear metric  by which  to decide
whether  it is  "speculative"  to say that a  decree  will  remedy the plain-
tiff's  injury.  It  is  manipulable,  second,  because,  as  we  have  seen,
whether  an injury  is  redressable  depends  on  how  it  is  defined.  If the
injury  in the Bakke case  was defined  as the right to  attend  law school,
the redressability requirement  was violated.  If the injury in a standard
environmental  case  is  defined  as  the right  not  to  suffer  concrete  per-
sonal health damage as  a result of environmental  harm, many  environ-

Standing After  Lujan

mental plaintiffs will be unable to show redressability.  If, however, the
injury is defined as freedom from a certain risk of health damage,  there
is  no  problem  of redressability.  This  indeed  appears  to  be  the  way
courts  conventionally  treat the issue.

Consider,  for  example,  some  of  the  regulatory  cases  described
above.  If an  agency  changes  its policy for determining fuel  efficiency,
will  prospective  purchasers  of fuel-efficient  vehicles  be  affected?  The
answer  is  not  clear.  Perhaps  manufacturers  would  simply  pay  civil
penalties,  rather  than  change  their  behavior. 292  It  is  speculative
whether government  policies will change the policies of manufacturers
soon  enough  to  affect particular  consumer  choices. 293  If the EPA  re-
fuses to  allow carcinogens  onto the market,  perhaps the consumer will
get  cancer  in  any  event;  perhaps  he  will  not get cancer  whatever  the
EPA does.  In fact, the EPA decision may well not make the difference
in  the life  of any particular  person.  Standing  might  therefore  be  de-
nied on  grounds  of redressability.

If we  were  to  start afresh,  the best way to handle the issue  would
be to  say that the  question  of standing  depends  on  whether  Congress
has  authorized  the  plaintiff  to  bring  suit.  We  should  be  asking
whether  the injury  that  Congress  sought  to  prevent  would  likely  be
redressed  by  a favorable judgment.2 94  The  redressability  requirement
might be understood as a crude way of asking that very question under
the general  rubric  of "injury  in  fact."  We  might therefore  try  to  an-
swer the redressability question by characterizing  the injury in the way
desired  by  Congress,  and then  seeing if that injury  would  be removed
by a decree  in the plaintiff's favor.  Through this route, the question of
characterization  could  be resolved  through legislative judgments,  not
judicial  ones.  And  while the  resulting  issues  of  statutory  interpreta-
tion  will  not  always  be simple,  they  raise  the right  questions.

E.  What Role Remains for the Citizen Suit?

The  status  of the citizen  suit is  somewhat  obscure  after Lujan.  At

[Tihe causation  and  redressability  question  is  meaningful  only at the  level  of determining
whether  a  cause  of action  should  exist  for  a  certain  group  of plaintiffs  under  a  particular
statutory  or constitutional  provision .... 
[G]iven the different  purposes  of different  statu-
tory and  constitutional provisions, some variation is  entirely appropriate  from one provision
to another....  The  question is  whether,  under  the statutory or constitutional  provision  at
issue,  the particular  provision  should be  read  to protect  against  the injury  asserted  by  the
kind  of person  who  is  seeking  to bring  suit.

a minimum,  we  know that  Congress  cannot  grant standing  to people
who  have  no  personal  stake  in the outcome  of an agency  action.  But
Justice  Kennedy, joined by Justice Souter,  said that Congress  "has the
power  to  define  injuries  and  articulate  chains  of causation  that  will
give rise  to a case  or  controversy  where none  existed  before. '2 95  This
is  a potentially  crucial phrase.  What does it mean?  At a minimum, it
means  that  Congress  can  create  rights  foreign  to  the  common  law.
These  include  the right to be free  from  discrimination,2 96 the  right to
occupational  safety,2 97  indeed,  the vast panoply  of statutory rights go-
ing beyond common law understandings.  It must also mean that Con-
gress  has the power to find causation,  perhaps deploying its factfinding
power,  where  courts  would  not  do  so. 298  Justice  Kennedy  thus  sug-
gests  that  Congress  can  find  causation  and  redressability  even  where
courts  would disagree.  Perhaps courts will review  such findings  under
a  deferential  standard.

This view  would  not change  the outcome  in Lujan.  In  that  case,
there  was no injury in fact.  But it might well make  a difference  in the
several  cases  in  which  the Court  has  previously  rejected  standing  on
grounds of causation and redressability.  Congress  might well  have the
power  to  alter  those  outcomes.

Suppose, for example,  that Congress  found  that efforts  to produce
desegregation  were adversely  affected  by  a grant  of tax  deductions  to
schools  that  discriminated  on  the  basis  of  race.  This  finding  might
well  call for  a reversal  of the  outcome in Allen  v.  Wright. 29 9  Or  sup-
pose  that  Congress  found  that  failure  to  attain  national  ambient  air
quality  standards in  New York  had  adverse health  effects  on  the  citi-
zens  of New  York,  New  Jersey, Connecticut,  and  Pennsylvania.  Per-
haps  courts  would  have  to  respect  this finding.

The  more  difficult  question  involves  constraints  on  Congress'

does not live.  See supra text  accompanying  note 202;  cf United States  Parole  Commn.  v.  Ger-

"power  to  define  injuries."  Can  Congress  say  that  opportunity-type
injuries  are  legally  cognizable?  Might  Congress  follow  the  Bakke
strategy and conclude  that standing exists in  many cases  involving in-
creases  in risks  or attempts to  alter incentives?  Lujan provides no au-
thoritative  answer.  But  Justice  Kennedy's  concurrence  suggests  that
Congress  does possess  power to define  these events  as injuries  for pur-
poses of standing.  Justice Kennedy  emphasized that standing need not
be based  solely  on common  law-like injuries;  his  concern  was  that, in
creating  the citizen suit, Congress had  not even  identified the injury it
was  attempting  to redress.  Congress  can meet this  concern by  identi-
fying  injuries,  building  on  the  common  law  framework  to  recognize
regulatory  harms.  The  decreased
probabilistic, 
probability  of injury,  the  grant  of opportunities,  and  the provision  of
appropriate  incentives  are key  goals of the regulatory  state.  It should
not  be  dificult  for  Congress  to  connect  these  goals  to  the  injuries it
seeks  to prevent.  Nothing in Article III forbids this course,  even after
Lujan.

systemic,  or 

F.  Private Defendants

Many citizen-suit  provisions in the environmental laws  give the cit-
izen  the option  of initiating  proceedings  against the private defendant
allegedly  operating  in  violation  of  federal  law.  Formally,  Lujan  did
not  address  this strategy because the case  involved  a governmental  de-
fendant.  Does Lujan affect  suits against private persons?  The  answer
is unclear.  We have seen that a large part of the Court's opinion  relies
on the fear that, without a particularized  injury, courts will be displac-
ing  executive power  under  the Take Care Clause.  This concern is  en-
tirely  inapplicable  when  the  executive  is  not  even  a party. 3°°  On  the
other  hand,  if Article  III  does  indeed  require  a  personal  stake,  the
identity  of the defendant should  not matter.  A  case  in which a citizen
initiates proceedings  against a private defendant  would indeed test the
claim that the Take  Care Clause is  a  major impetus behind  the Lujan
decision.

I have argued that this claim makes  little sense.  If so,  and if Lujan
remains  good  law,  a  citizen  should  not  have  standing  to  proceed
against a  private defendant  unless he  can show  some  kind of personal

300.  A qualification  is  necessary  here.  When  private people  sue other  private people to  en-
force federal statutory  law, there  is a lurking  issue about private interference  with the exercise  of
prosecutorial  discretion,  and  hence  with  the  President's  "Take  Care"  power.  But  this  issue
surely does not have constitutional  status.  Parallel public and private remedies are most familiar
to American  law;  they  do  not violate  the Constitution.

[Vol.  91:163

stake.  After Lujan, the citizen-suit  provisions  are  probably  unconsti-
tutional  even  when  the  defendant is  a private  citizen  or corporation.

G.  Cash Bounties

Perhaps Congress  can respond to Lujan by  granting  cash bounties
to citizen plaintiffs.  Indeed,  this possibility might produce some of the
most important  and  difficult  post-Lujan issues.  If Congress  wants  to
reinstate the citizen  suit after Lujan, a cash bounty  would be the  sim-
plest  strategy.  Indeed,  an  exceedingly  short  amendment  to  existing
law, giving  a bounty to  all successful  citizen  plaintiffs,  should be  suffi-
cient.  For  reasons  that follow,  the  bounty  should  create  an  interest
and  hence  standing.  In  this  way,  a  system  of bounties  would  fully
overcome  the post-Lujan doubts  about the citizen suit.  A bounty  sys-
tem would  also be more straightforward  than the principal  alternative
strategy  now  available  to  Congress,  involving  restructured  property
rights. 30 1

A bounty  system would  have the important  advantage  of building
on  the  clear  historical  precedents  of qui  tam  and  informers'  actions,
precedents  that are firmly  established  in  American law.302  To the ex-
tent  that the citizen suit is  a helpful  device,303 Congress  should  be en-
couraged  to  take  this  step.  At least where  administrative  inaction  is
both  harmful  and  predictable,  and  where  it  cannot  be  prevented
through  more  fundamental  regulatory  reform, 304  a  bounty  system
would  make  a great deal of sense.  Indeed, the creation  of a system  of
citizen  bounties  could  well  be a major  step in  administrative  law.

1.  Private Defendants

In the first  case,  Congress  might  allow  citizens  to  proceed  against
polluters or others without  requiring  a conventional  injury in fact, but
with  provision  for  a  financial  bounty  to  victorious  citizen  litigants.
Does  the  bounty  create  the  requisite  personal  interest  or  concrete
stake?

In this context, Lujan is probably inapplicable by its own rationale.
There is  no  risk that courts  will  usurp  executive  functions  under  the
Take  Care Clause.  The  executive  is not a  defendant.  Not  only is  the
executive  not involved,  but the plaintiff has  a  concrete  interest  in  the
form  of the bounty.  Standing seems  perfectly appropriate.  In fact, the

Standing After  Lujan

Lujan Court seemed  to  invite  this  conclusion:  "Nor,  finally,  is  [this]
the unusual case  in which  Congress has  created  a concrete  private in-
terest  in the outcome  of a suit  against a private party for the govern-
ment's  benefit,  by  providing  a  cash  bounty  for  the  victorious
plaintiff. ' 30 5  The qui tam action  and the informers'  action 30 6  seem  to
be  decisive  precedents  in  favor  of this  conclusion.  In both  of these
actions,  a bounty was  provided,  and it would  be most adventurous  to
say  that these  arrangements  violated  Article  III.

2.  Executive Defendants

In  the second case,  Congress  might give  a cash bounty  to litigants
who  have  prevailed  against  the  government.  It might,  for  example,
award  $500  to  plaintiffs  in  cases  involving  environmental  harms.  It
might  even  amend  all  current  citizen-suit  provisions  in  order  to  pro-
vide  a  cash  bounty.  A  simple  statute  could  accomplish  this  goal.
Would this  entail  a different  outcome  from  that in Lujan?

The  answer is  unclear.  On  the one hand,  the executive  remains  a
defendant,  and  the Lujan  objection  from  the  Take  Care  Clause  re-
mains.  On  the  other  hand,  the  existence  of a  cash  bounty  gives  the
plaintiff the equivalent  of a  personal  stake  in  the outcome,  just like  a
case in  which she has  a right  to  obtain damages  from  a common law
tortfeasor.  This  personal  stake  is  probably  sufficient  to  create  stand-
ing.  Here  the informers'  action  is  a direct  precedent.

The Take Care Clause,  even  as understood in Lujan, is likely to be
held irrelevant where a bounty is at stake.  According to the Court, the
clause  furnishes  no  objection  in a  case  in which the plaintiff can show
that  the government's  allegedly  unlawful  inaction  impairs  her  enjoy-
ment  of some environmental  asset.  Hence the Take Care Clause  is not
a freestanding  objection  to  suits of this general  kind.  It is  called  into
play  only in cases  without a personal  stake for the plaintiff.  If a plain-
tiff can  show  that  she stands  to  gain  or lose from  the  outcome  of the
action,  she is no longer interested only in "law enforcement  for its own
sake."  She  thus has  standing to  initiate  the action.

If this analysis is correct, Congress  has available  a relatively  simple
corrective  to Lujan if it believes  that the decision will significantly  un-
dermine its regulatory  goals.  Existing  statutes  can be simply amended
through the grant  of a bounty to  victorious citizen plaintiffs.  No Arti-
cle III problem  would result from this initiative.  If Congress wants to
overcome  Lujan, this  is  the best  and  simplest  route.  It would  make

jan draws  them  into  severe  doubt.

H.  Redefined Property Rights

I have  criticized  the injury-in-fact test on  the ground  that it under-
mines  Congress'  power  to  create  property  rights  where  they  had  not
existed  before.  In Lujan, the  plaintiffs  might  well  have  asserted  that
the conferral  of a cause  of action amounted to the creation of a form of
property.  Justice  Kennedy  had  an  answer  to  this  claim:  "Congress
has the power to define  injuries  and articulate  chains  of causation  that
will  give  rise  to  a case  or  controversy  where  none  existed  before. '30 7
But here  Congress has  refused  to  "identify  the injury  it seeks to vindi-
cate  and  relate  the  injury  to  the  class  of  persons  entitled  to  bring
suit. ' 30 8  Apparently, plaintiffs  had  no property  right  under  the ESA,
because Congress  failed explicitly to  define  the relevant  injury  when it
provided  for citizen  suits.

a tenancy  in common  -

Suppose, then, that Congress  attempts to create a citizen  suit in the
following  way.  It announces,  first,  that all  Americans  have  a  kind of
property  right -
in some  environmental  as-
set.  The asset might be  clean  air anywhere  in the country, or  pristine
areas,  or the continued  existence  of endangered  species  in the United
States  or  abroad.  If  this  seems  odd,  we  might  note  that  Congress
could surely  create property rights in unowned  land within the United
States; to the extent that such rights do not interfere  with the claims  of
a  competing  sovereign,  Congress  can  create  them  with  respect  to
unowned land outside  our territorial borders. 309  And surely  Congress'
capacity  to  create  property  rights  is  not  limited  to  land.  If Congress
thus defines  property rights and injuries and creates a correlative  cause
of  action,  has  it  acted  appropriately  and  met  Justice  Kennedy's
concern?

The  answer  would  seem  to  be affirnmative.  The  advantages  of ex-
press legislative creation  of a property right  are that it would build  on
common law  understandings  and produce more  focused congressional
deliberation  on the nature  of the interest it is creating.  The citizen  suit

309.  The  point  may  seem  odd, but  we  can  imagine  an  example.  Suppose  that  an  area  in
Argentina  produces medicines  especially  beneficial  to Americans.  Suppose  that  the activities  of
private  American  companies  in Argentina threaten  to industrialize  that area  and  thus  to elimi-
nate its medicinal  capacities.  Congress  might respond by forbidding these activities  and by creat-
ing a property  right in all  Americans,  operating  only against other Americans, to  the continued
productivity of the area.  This could  not possibly raise a constitutional issue, or even a problem  of
international  law.

Standing After  Lujan

has  become  a relatively  automatic  part of environmental  law,  with lit-
tle  legislative  attention  to  its  nature  and  consequences.  If the  citizen
suit is  in fact  intended to  give all  citizens  the equivalent  of a beneficial
interest  in  environmental  quality,  it  may  well  be  desirable  to  focus
congressional  attention on exactly that question.  And if Congress  con-
cludes  that it seeks  to create  this kind of property,  there should  be no
constitutional  problem.

Indeed, the  case  would  seem to be very close  to Havens Realty,3 10
discussed  above.  If there  is  a difference,  it  is  that, in the cases  under
discussion,  Congress has  created a tenancy  in common with respect to
a collective  good -
that is, property  that is jointly owned.  In Havens
Realty, by  contrast,  the  property  right  could  be  held  by  individuals
rather  than many  people  at  once.

Under  Justice  Scalia's  conception  of  standing,  this  distinction
would  make a difference.  In the collective  good case, unlike  in Havens
Realty, we are hardly dealing with "minorities."  Majorities  may have
less  need  for the  citizen  suit.  But  this  conception  of  standing  faces
many  problems,  as  elaborated  above.  In  any  event,  Justice  Kennedy
clearly disagrees  on this point.  His opinion  plainly  says that standing
is not  to be denied  simply because many people are  adversely  affected.
If all  this is  correct,  some  of the most interesting  developments  in
the law of standing  may arise when  Congress is  explicit in its intention
to  create  new  forms  of property  adapted  to  the problems  and  aspira-
tions  of modem regulation.  If Congress  creates  property rights  in en-
vironmental  assets  of various  sorts,  and  grants  correlative  causes  of
action,  it  should  be  able  to  overcome  the strictures  of Lujan.  Faced
with such  an enactment,  the  Court would not be dealing with a "citi-
zen  suit"  at all.  Instead  it would be faced with a suit brought by  prop-
erty  holders  equipped  with  causes  of action;  and  it would  be  odd  if
congressional  initiatives  in  this  direction  would  be  held  inconsistent
with Article  III.

CONCLUSION

At least in general,  standing depends on whether any source  of law
has  created  a cause  of action.  To  a large  extent,  that  question  is  for
congressional  resolution.  Congress  can  create  standing  as  it  chooses
and, in general,  can deny standing when  it likes. 311  As an  abstraction

independent  of what  the law  says,  an  injury in  fact is  neither a  neces-
sary nor  a  sufficient  condition  for standing.  Indeed,  the notion  of in-
jury  in  fact  is  a  form  of Lochner-style  substantive  due  process.  It
assumes that there  can  be a factual  inquiry into  "injury"  independent
of evaluation  and of legal conventions.  There  can be no  such law-free
inquiry.  It is a conceptual  impossibility, indeed a form of metaphysics.
Despite  the  holding  of Lujan,  Congress  should  be  permitted  to
grant standing to  citizens.  The text and history of Article  III provide
no support  for judicial  invalidation  of congressional  grants  of citizen
standing.  On the contrary, England, the American colonies,  and early
Congresses  all  granted  standing to  strangers.  No  one  suggested  that
this  practice  violated  the  Constitution.  The Lujan  Court's  unprece-
dented invalidation  of a provision  for citizen  standing has  no basis  in
Article  III.  The Court  should not have reached  its important conclu-
sion  without  investigating  the relevant  history,  and the odd  evolution
of standing doctrine,  in much  more  detail.

Lujan answers  a long-unresolved  issue;  but it  leaves  a  number  of
other  significant  questions  unanswered.  I have  tried  to  describe how
they  might be resolved.  It seems  clear that citizen-suit  provisions  are
now  impermissible  in  the absence  of a showing  of injury  in  fact.  But
Lujan  permits  environmental  actions  whenever  plaintiffs  can  show
that  environmental  degradation  will  affect  their  geographical  area  in
the form of dirtier air,  dirtier water, or inferior aesthetics.  Many  suits
by  regulatory beneficiaries  will  thus remain  viable.

Perhaps  most  important,  Congress  probably  retains  a  relatively
simple  mechanism by  which to  accomplish  the purposes  that underlie
current  provisions  for citizen  actions.  Certainly  it  can  grant  citizens
standing against  private  defendants  so  long as  it  allows  some  kind  of
bounty  for a victorious lawsuit.  Almost certainly, Lujan permits  Con-
gress  to allow  citizens to  bring suit against the government  for insuffi-
cient  regulatory  action,  if a  bounty  is  made  available  in  the  event  of
success.

Most  intriguingly,  Justice  Kennedy's  concurring  opinion  leaves
open the possibility that Congress  has  the power  to create  quite novel
property  interests,  to  grant  those interests  to  many  people  or even  to
citizens,  and  to  confer  standing  to  enable  people  to  vindicate  those
interests.  It may  be  that, in  cases  raising  this  issue,  we  will  see  the
ultimate depth of the Court's commitment to Lujan's odd adventure in
substantive  due  process.

standing  to people  attempting  to vindicate  constitutional  rights.  See Fletcher, supra note  15,  at
