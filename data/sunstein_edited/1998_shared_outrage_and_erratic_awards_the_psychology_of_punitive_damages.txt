 Abstract

 An experimental study of punitive damage awards in personal injury cases was conducted, using jury-eligible

 respondents. There was substantial consensus on judgments of the outrageousness of a defendant's actions and

 of the appropriate severity of punishment. Judgments of dollar awards made by individuals and synthetic juries

 were much more erratic. These results are familiar characteristics of judgments made on unbounded magnitude

 scales. The degree of harm suffered by the plaintiff and the size of the firm had a pronounced effect on awards.

 Some judgmental tasks are far easier than others for juries to perform, and reform possibilities should exploit
 this fact.

 Key words: Punitive damages, law and psychology, jury decision making

 JEL Classification: K00 - Law and Economics: General

 A system of justice must make distinctions: it should treat alike cases that are relevantly

 alike, and it should treat differently cases that are relevantly different. A system that metes

 out erratic and unpredictable punishments for similar transgressions fails to satisfy the
 first of these criteria. A system that provides crude punishments poorly linked to the
 distinctive features of particular cases fails to satisfy the second. Many critics have
 charged that the system of punitive damages is prone to such failures (e.g., Jeffries, 1986;
 Huber, 1989).

 We use the terms 'erratic' and 'unpredictable' interchangeably in this article, both in a
 rather unusual sense: we imagine a legal expert trying to anticipate the award that will be

 made in a particular case, either by considering similar cases in the past, or by examining
 the responses of a mock jury. The confidence that the expert may reasonably attach to her
 opinion about the outcome of the case depends on how much the decisions of different
 juries considering the same case are likely to differ. If they do not treat the similarly
 situated similarly, awards that are in this sense erratic or unpredictable are unjust; they are
 also inefficient from the economic point of view, because they impose an unnecessary

 burden of uncertainty both on plaintiffs (and their lawyers) and on potential defendants.
 If the social function of punitive damages is to provide a deterrent signal, as many
 theorists argue (see Polinsky and Shavell, 1997), unpredictability reduces the quality of
 that signal. Erratic awards are an ill wind that blows no one any good.

 The awarding of punitive damages is a decision, and like other decisions it can be

 examined usefully from three distinctive points of view: normative, descriptive, and pre-
 scriptive (Bell, Raiffa and Tversky, 1988). Normative analysis is concerned with what

 ought to be. A normative analysis of punitive damages will seek to anchor this particular

 aspect of legal practice in a broader view of justice and of the purpose of the legal system.

 Existing normative treatments of the issue come in several flavors, which variously em-

 phasize ethical concerns, most prominently retribution, and economic efficiency (Galanter
 and Luban, 1993; Polinsky and Shavell, 1997; Landes and Posner, 1993). A descriptive

 analysis seeks an understanding of the factors that govern actual decisions. A descriptive
 treatment of punitive damages will be concerned with an analysis of the social and
 psychological factors that affect the decisions of juries. Finally, a prescriptive analysis

 considers ways to overcome the limitations of decision makers, and thereby to improve
 decisions. The goal of a prescriptive approach to punitive damages will be to change the
 jurors' task so as to make it easier for them to reach normatively appropriate decisions.

 The main focus of the present article is descriptive. We offer a psychological theory -

 called the outrage model - which describes the process by which individual jurors set
 punitive awards. We also identify a stage of this process that could be responsible for

 much of the random variability in these awards. We conclude that the critical stage is the

 mapping of a judgment about the appropriate severity of punishment (which we will call

 punitive intent) onto the dollar scale. By itself, punitive intent is quite predictable in the

 sense that we defined earlier: for the personal injury cases explored in our study, there is
 substantial social consensus about the severity of punishment that is appropriate for
 different cases, and different juries viewing the same cases will generally form similar
 punitive intentions. The consensus breaks down, however, when jurors are asked to ex-
 press punitive intent in dollars, the response mode required by the legal system. Our
 evidence suggests that different juries considering the same case would often assign very
 different damages, even if they agree in their punitive intent.

 The prescriptive task of legal reform should be informed jointly by a psychological
 analysis of judgments of punitive damages and by a normative assessment of the appro-
 priate role of community sentiment in the award of such damages. Our analysis identifies
 three positions on this issue, ordered below from least to most radical: (i) community
 sentiment about awards is normatively acceptable, but juries provide a poor estimate of
 this sentiment, because of sampling error; (ii) the community's punitive intent is norma-
 tively acceptable, but community sentiment about dollar awards is poorly informed and
 lacks normative force; (iii) the community's punitive intent must be rejected as a norma-
 tive standard, because it is an illegitimate basis for punitive damage awards. Naturally,
 these three assessments are associated with quite different suggestions for legal reform.
 The normative and prescriptive analyses are developed more fully in a companion paper
 (Sunstein, Kahneman and Schkade, 1998).

 We proceed as follows. Section 1 sets out the outrage model and outlines the goals of
 the study. Section 2 describes the procedures and instruments used in the research. Section

 3 presents the results. Section 4 reviews the argument and sketches the implications of the
 findings for legal reform. Section 5 concludes.

 1. The outrage model

 The vast literature on punitive damages has been mainly normative; it is concerned with
 the social function of punitive awards and with the legal criteria for granting them.
 Standard accounts suggest that punitive damages are justified as a means of overcoming
 the problem of underdeterrence created by the tort system's failure to detect and com-

 pensate all injured plaintiffs (Landes and Posner, 1993), and also as a way of reflecting the
 "sense of the community" about the appropriate retribution that should be imposed on
 especially serious wrongdoers (Galanter and Luban, 1993). There is little room in most of

 these treatments for the emotions of outrage and indignation (for an exception, see Hamp-
 ton, 1993). These emotions are of course central to a psychological analysis. Although
 there are some exceptions, punishment is generally best understood as an act which
 expresses emotions of anger and indignation and is intended to cause suffering (Hampton,
 1993; Kahan and Nussbaum, 1996).

 We will propose a descriptive model of the psychology of punitive awards, building on
 a more general theoretical analysis (Kahneman and Ritov, 1998), which extends the
 concept of attitude beyond the domain of public issues in which it is most often applied.
 There is much evidence that a basic process of evaluation goes on continuously as people
 respond to the objects and events of their lives (Bargh et al., 1996). As we use the term,
 each of these objects and events evokes an attitude, which combines an emotional evalu-
 ation and a response tendency. The evaluations range from intense liking to intense
 dislike, and the response tendencies vary from approach to avoidance or from support to
 aggression. The evaluations and intentions that define attitudes can be expressed overtly in
 multiple ways, ranging from physiological indications of emotion to responses in opinion
 surveys.

 The main implication of the present analysis is that highly diverse responses will

 correlate closely if they express the same attitudes. Indeed, high correlations (often in
 excess of .80) have been observed between group averages of different attitude measures,
 computed over a set of public issues (Kahneman and Knetsch, 1992; Kahneman and Ritov,
 1994, 1998; Kahneman et al, 1993). The results of the present study will confirm the
 generality of this observation.

 Figure 1 summarizes the outrage model of punitive damages, in which these damages
 are considered an expression of an angry or indignant attitude toward a transgressor. The
 evaluative aspect of the attitude is labeled outrage. The response tendency is labeled
 punitive intent. The goal of the model is to account for differences in the average
 responses of populations of respondents to various actions and various defendants. The
 figure is to be read from left to right.

 The variables listed under 'case features' in Figure 1 are some of the characteristics of

 an action that determine the intensity of outrage and the severity of punitive intent. The

 figure represents outrage as basic, and punitive intent as determined jointly by outrage and
 by additional factors. This representation is appropriate because the determinants of out-
 rage are a proper subset of the case features that control punitive intent. Two factors that
 affect punitive intent independently of outrage are identified in the figure: the harm
 suffered by the victim and the relationship between the victim and the individual making

 the judgment.

 The description of an action can evoke outrage without any information about the harm
 that it caused. However, the harm that an action caused is a factor in punitive intent. This

 retributive aspect of punishment is incorporated in many aspects of the law, such as the

 large discrepancy between the sentences for murder and for attempted murder. The rela-
 tionship between victim and juror was manipulated in an experiment by Hastie, Schkade
 and Payne (1997); awards were larger when the plaintiff was located in the jurors' com-
 munity than when the plaintiff was from a remote location. We speculate that the retribu-
 tive urge is stronger when the victim belongs to one's group than when the victim is a
 stranger. Although punitive intent is affected by some factors that do not affect outrage,

 our general hypothesis is that most of the determinants of the two states are shared - and
 we therefore expect them to be highly correlated.

 In some situations the expression of an attitude is not spontaneous, but is restricted to

 a particular scale of responses. Stringent constraints apply, for example, when respondents
 in opinion surveys are asked to indicate the extent of their agreement or disagreement
 with a particular statement. In the situation with which we are concerned here, the
 responses of juries dealing with punitive awards are restricted to a scale of dollars. The

 different expressions of an attitude are affected by specific factors that may induce some
 (usually slight) differences among them. Thus, the column labeled 'mapping factors' in
 Figure 1 identifies some variables that affect the mapping of punitive intent onto the dollar

 scale, but not onto a rating scale of punitive intent. For example, we propose that the size
 of the defendant firm is a scaling factor in translating punitive intent into dollars: a

 judgment that appears severe when the defendant is a small firm may appear grossly
 inadequate when the defendant is a giant. Other factors that affect the accuracy of the
 mapping of punitive intent onto the dollar scale are discussed in the following section.

 In summary, the outrage model assumes internal states of outrage and punitive intent,
 which can be mapped onto different response scales. As we see next, these scales vary
 both in their complexity and in the precision and reliability of the measurement that they
 support: some scales are 'noisier' than others. The main conclusion of this paper will be
 that the dollar scale is an extremely noisy expression of punitive intent.

 1. 1. Mapping psychological states into overt responses

 For more than a century, psychologists have studied the processes by which internal states
 are mapped onto overt responses. An important distinction drawn in this research is
 between category scales and magnitude scales. Category scales consist of a bounded set

 of ordered responses, as in the familiar format of many opinion surveys. The categories
 can be represented by numbers; in such cases descriptive labels are always attached to the
 extremes of the scale, and sometimes to some or all intermediate values. It is generally
 assumed that category scales are invariant to a linear transformation: a response of 5 on
 a scale that ranges from 1 to 7 is interpreted as equivalent to a response of 40 on a scale

 that ranges from 0 to 60. As this example illustrates, the zero point on a category scale has
 no particular significance.

 Internal states can also be mapped onto magnitude scales, which have a meaningful
 zero and no upper bound. The study of magnitude scaling was pioneered by S.S. Stevens
 (1975). The standard application of this technique is in the measurement of the psycho-
 physical functions that relate the intensity of subjective experiences to the intensity of the
 physical stimulus that evokes them. In a typical experiment, the observer is exposed to a
 series of sounds that vary in loudness, or lights that vary in brightness, or electric shocks

 that vary in painful intensity. The observer is instructed to assign a positive number to
 each stimulus according to the relative intensity of the subjective experience that it
 evokes. Magnitude estimation has also been applied to social judgments, such as the
 heinousness of crimes and the severity of punishments (Stevens, 1975; Lodge, 1981).

 The research on magnitude scaling has yielded several robust and quite general findings
 (Stevens, 1975). (1) There is substantial agreement among observers on the ratios of the
 magnitudes that they assign to the internal responses evoked by particular stimuli. For
 example, if one observer assigns three objects magnitudes of 1, 2 and 6, another observer

 who assigns a value of 5 to the first stimulus would be expected to assign values of 10 and
 30 to the other two. (2) The distribution of judgments of any particular stimulus is

 positively skewed; skewed distributions are observed both in an individual's judgments of

 the same stimulus over repeated occasions and for the judgments of a stimulus by different
 judges. (3) The standard deviation of the judgments of a stimulus is proportional to the
 mean of these judgments; this relationship also holds both for an individual's judgments
 of the same stimulus over repeated occasions and for the judgments of a stimulus by
 different judges. (4) Unless the experimenter specifies a standard stimulus and a rating
 that should be assigned to it (called a modulus), there are large differences in the mean
 values of judgments: some observers assign generally high numbers to all stimuli, others

 assign low numbers. (5) In general, magnitude judgments of sensory intensity are related
 by a power function to the relevant physical variable: for example, brightness is a power
 function of luminance and loudness is a power function of sound amplitude (both with an
 exponent of approximately 1/3). (6) When the same stimuli are independently scaled on
 a magnitude scale and on an interval scale, the values of stimuli on the magnitude scale
 are related by a power function to their value on the category scale.

 Like other internal states that vary in intensity, outrage and punitive intent can be
 expressed either on category scales or on magnitude scales. For example, respondents
 could be asked to evaluate the outrageousness of different actions on a category scale
 ranging from "not outrageous" to "extremely outrageous". Alternatively, respondents
 could be asked to rate outrage on an unbounded numerical scale, where zero indicates no

 outrage, and a particular number (the modulus) is assigned to the outrageousness of a
 specified action (the standard). The modulus defines the unit of measurement. We would

 expect to observe characteristic differences between the judgments on the two scales. In
 particular, the standard deviations of the judgments of different cases should be very
 strongly correlated with the means of judgments expressed on the magnitude scale, but
 not on the category scale.1

 The dollar scale of punitive awards satisfies the technical definition of a magnitude
 scale of punitive intent: the scale has a meaningful zero and no upper bound. The unit of
 measurement (dollars) is specified in this case. Our main hypothesis, however, is that the
 unit in which judgments are denominated is largely meaningless to potential jurors, who
 lack relevant experience in mapping their punitive intent onto the dollar scale. We there-

 fore expect judgments of punitive awards to exhibit the high variability and positive skew
 that are observed in magnitude scaling without a modulus: individuals who agree in their
 underlying punitive intent may differ widely in the overall level of awards they assign,
 even if they agree on the ratios of awards for different cases. To test this prediction we
 compare expressions of punitive intent in two formats: category-scale ratings of the
 appropriate severity of punishment and judgments of punitive awards in dollars.

 We use the category scales of outrage and of punitive intent, and the dollar scale of
 punitive damages to examine two related hypotheses. The first is that outrage and intent
 to punish conform to a bedrock of socially determined norms. The mapping of attitudes
 onto category scales with verbally defined categories provides sufficient guidance to
 achieve some uniformity in the use in the scales, and therefore preserves the underlying
 social consensus. In contrast, there are few constraints on the mapping of punitive intent
 to dollars. Our second hypothesis is that large individual differences in the use of the
 dollar scale induce extremely large variances when jurors are asked to express their
 punitive intent in dollar amounts. Here is the critical point: Because of the unfortunate

 features of the dollar scale, two juries that share the same punitive intentions may set very

 different punitive awards.

 1.2. The study

 We designed a study to test several implications of the outrage model. Respondents were
 given a set of vignettes of personal injury cases in which a plaintiff (always an individual)

 sued a firm for compensatory and punitive damages. The respondents were told to assume
 in all cases that compensatory damages had been awarded in the amount of $200,000, and
 that punitive damages were to be considered. Different groups provided different judg-
 ments of these scenarios. Respondents in the outrage condition were asked to rate the
 outrageousness of the defendant's behavior. Respondents in the punishment condition
 rated how severely they wished to punish the defendant. Finally, respondents in the dollar
 award condition were asked to assess the amount of punitive damages (if any) that should
 be awarded.

 We examined the following hypotheses:

 (1) The outrage evoked by scenarios of tortious behavior is governed by broadly

 shared social norms. The ranking of different scenarios by their outrageousness is
 expected to be generally similar for different demographic groups (See Section 3.1.3).

 (2) Punitive intent is determined by the outrageousness of the defendant's behavior

 and by other case factors, prominently including the harm suffered by the plain-
 tiff. The prediction that harm affects punitive intent but not outrage was tested by
 presenting alternative versions of some scenarios, in which the severity of the harm
 suffered by the plaintiff was varied (See Section 3.1.4).

 (3) Damage awards are determined by punitive intent and by specific mapping fac-
 tors, prominently including the size of the defendant firm. This prediction was
 tested by presenting each scenario in two versions, in which the size of the defendant
 was varied (See Section 3.1.5).

 (4) Large individual differences in the use of the dollar scale reduce the precision
 with which population norms for punitive awards can be estimated from the
 judgments of small samples of respondents, such as juries. This hypothesis was
 tested in two ways. First, we compared the amount of measurement error in ratings of
 punitive intent on a category scale and in dollar awards. Second, we predicted that
 transformations of dollar awards that remove individual differences in scale usage
 (e.g, transforming each individual's responses to ranks) would result in a sharp re-
 duction in unsystematic variability. The rationale for this prediction is that such
 transformations eliminate the skewness and reduce the arbitrary variability associated

 with the dollar scale but retain the ordinal correspondence of punishments to punitive
 intentions (See Sections 3.2 and 3.3.1).

 (5) Because there is less error variance in ratings of punitive intent than in dollar

 awards, these ratings are a more accurate predictor of community sentiment
 about appropriate dollar awards than dollar awards themselves. The dollar award

 that a jury makes in a particular case can be thought of as an estimate of community
 sentiment about the appropriate award, which we define as the median of individual
 judgments in the population. It is possible in principle that jury ratings of punitive
 intent could provide a more accurate estimate. We tested this hypothesis by comparing
 the precision of estimates based on judgments of dollar awards and of punishment
 ratings (See Section 3.3.2).

 2. Method

 2.1. Sample and procedure

 The sample consisted of 899 jury-eligible respondents who were recruited from the Travis

 County, Texas voter registration list by a professional survey firm and paid $35 for their
 participation. The resulting sample had good representation from various demographic
 and socio-economic groups. For example, respondents were 44% male; 64% Caucasian,
 16% African- American, 15% Hispanic; median income = $30K-$50K; median education
 = Some College; median age = 30-39. Thirty-two respondents were dropped from the
 sample because they gave incomplete responses or failed to understand the task.

 The survey was conducted at a downtown hotel. Participants were run in large groups
 at pre-arranged times over a four day period. Most respondents completed their task in 30
 to 45 minutes.

 Each respondent received three pages of general instructions and four numbered enve-

 lopes. The first three envelopes contained the materials for Parts 1 , 2 and 3 of the study,
 as described below. The fourth envelope contained demographic questions and debriefing
 information. The instructions (which are excerpted in Appendix I) included (1) an over-
 view of the survey procedure, (2) an explanation of the task of jurors in civil (as opposed
 to criminal) trials, (3) definitions of and distinctions between compensatory and punitive
 damages, including the fact that compensatory damages had already been awarded in the
 cases they would consider, (4) a summary of standard legal conditions for punitive dam-
 ages (maliciousness or reckless disregard for the welfare of others), and (5) a reminder
 about the standard of evidence required in this situation (preponderance of the evidence).

 2.2. Design and stimuli

 Ten scenarios describing personal injury cases were constructed (summarized in Table 1 ;
 full versions in Appendix II). The first six were used in Parts 1 and 2 of the procedure and
 the other four in Part 3. Each respondent rated some version of all ten scenarios. Envelope
 #1 contained material about one of the first six scenarios. Envelope #2 contained the other
 five of these six scenarios. Envelope #3 contained the four scenarios used in Part 3 of the

 experiment.

 In Parts 1 and 2, between-subjects manipulations were response mode (Outrage, Pun-

 ishment or $ Damages) and firm size (annual profits of $10-$20 million (Medium) or

 burned when his pajamas caught fire, the injuries were described as "He was severely

 3. Results

 We discuss the results in three parts. Section 3.1 is concerned with the validity of the
 outrage model shown in Figure 1. Section 3.2 deals with the predictability of dollar
 damage awards, and with the role of individual differences. Section 3.3 considers the
 question of unpredictability at the level of juries. We examine the hypothesis that vari-
 ability in the individuals' use of the dollar scale is sufficient to be a major cause of
 unpredictability in jury awards.

 3.1. The outrage model

 The analyses in this section examine some of the social norms that govern evaluations of
 the actions of firms and the intended severity of punishment for harmful negligence. They

 focus on the average judgments of the general public (as represented in our sample), and
 of sub-populations within it.

 3.1.1 . Preliminary analysis: The effect of context. Unlike real jurors, who are exposed to
 a single case for a long time, the participants in our study responded to a total of 10
 personal injury cases in quick succession, and had an opportunity to compare these
 scenarios to each other. To examine the effect of this unusual procedure, every participant
 first encountered one of the first six scenarios in Table 1, which was presented in a

 separate envelope and was evaluated in isolation from the others (Part 1). The experimen-
 tal design provides a comparison of the distribution of judgments to each scenario when
 it is judged in isolation or in the context of other scenarios. The context was provided in
 envelope 2, where subjects were instructed to read through all five scenarios therein before

 responding to any one. In addition, of course, each subject had already responded to the
 scenario they encountered in envelope 1, which also contributed to the context. The
 relevant data are summarized in Table 3, which shows the mean outrage and punishment

 judgments and median dollar awards for each scenario in the isolation and in the context
 conditions.

 To test whether the availability of a context altered intuitions, we computed rank-
 correlations (N = 12) over the scenarios of Table 3, between the judgments in the isolation
 condition and in the context condition. The correlations are high: .88, and .90, respec-
 tively, for the means of outrage and punishment ratings, .89 for the medians of dollar
 awards.

 We also examined whether the availability of a context of comparison affected the
 distribution of judgments. Except for a small but significant increase in the severity of
 punishment in the context condition (i = 3.19,/? < .01), the means of judgments made in

 range of the judgments of different scenarios. The variances of mean judgments of outrage
 and punishment over the 12 scenarios are larger in the context condition. In a test for a
 difference between correlated variances, the effect of context is significant for the pun-
 ishment condition (F(l,10) = 6.87, p < .05), and marginally significant for outrage (F =
 4.07, p < .10). The results for a similar comparison of the medians of dollar awards are
 similar (F = 4.64,/? < .10). The availability of a context apparently makes a serious case
 appear more serious than it would on its own, and makes a milder case appear milder.

 The small effect of a comparison context in improving discriminations among cases
 could be useful in the design of possible reforms of the jury's task. However, the fact that
 the effect of context is small allows us to generalize the conclusions of the present
 experiment with some confidence to situations in which no context is provided (the
 standard case for real juries) or to situations in which other scenarios might be used.

 3.1.2. Average judgments of scenarios. Table 4 presents measures of central tendency for
 the three types of response (outrage, punishment and awards) for each of the scenarios
 presented in the experiment. Because the context effects analyzed in the preceding section

 are small, judgments obtained in Part 1 and in Part 2 of the questionnaire are pooled in the

 are also similar. The most consistent effect of a context of similar cases is to increase the

 data of Table 4. Different summary statistics are used for the different variables. Means

 are shown for ratings of outrage and of intended punishment. For dollar awards, the Table
 presents medians and the proportion of respondents who indicated that the award should
 be zero. The use of the median is justified because the distribution of dollar awards was

 severely skewed, as expected for judgments on a magnitude scale. The scenarios appear in
 descending order of the mean punishment rating. Separate values are shown for the
 medium-firm and large-firm versions of each scenario, and also for the low-harm and

 high-harm versions of the four scenarios used in Part 3 of the questionnaire.

 The main observation from Table 4 is that the order of the scenarios from worst to

 mildest is quite similar for the three responses. The means of outrage ratings and dollar
 awards generally decline, concordant with the mean punishment ratings that were used to
 arrange the scenarios. We computed the Pearson correlation between the values shown in

 Table 4 (N = 28). The correlation between the means of outrage and punishment ratings
 is very high (.98). The correlations of these two variables with median dollar awards are

 lower (.69 and .78, respectively for outrage and punishment ratings). As we shall see later,

 these correlations are attenuated by the low signal/noise ratio of the dollar response.
 Because the skewed distribution of dollar awards has a more severe effect on the stability

 of sample means than of medians, the correlations of outrage and punishment ratings with
 the means of dollar awards are even lower (.51 and .61, respectively).

 3.1.3. Demographic analyses. Do the averages shown in Table 4 represent responses to
 broadly shared social norms? Are there different norms for different social groups? To
 answer these questions we broke down the sample according to different criteria, includ-
 ing ethnicity, gender, education and income. A table similar to Table 4 was computed
 separately for each subcategory (e.g., women and men). We then computed Pearson
 correlations between the mean judgments of mutually exclusive categories of respondents,
 over the 28 scenarios. Table 5 presents the correlations for mean punishment ratings.

 The results of Table 5 indicate that the ratings of punitive intent reflect norms on which
 there is little or no disagreement between different social groups. Men and women,
 Hispanics and whites, and respondents at very different levels of income produce very
 similar orderings of the 28 scenarios used in the study. Judgments of intent to punish in
 these scenarios of personal injury cases evidently rest on a bedrock of moral intuitions that
 are broadly shared in society.

 The results for outrage ratings are generally similar, though the correlations are slightly
 lower (a median correlation of .94, compared to .99 for punishment ratings). The lower
 correlations reflect the slightly lower statistical reliability of outrage ratings. The corre-
 lations between mean judgments of dollar awards are much lower (the median correlation
 was .65), another indication of the poor reliability of this measure. This unreliability, of
 course, could be mitigated by using larger samples.

 aEntries are correlations between mean responses to scenarios by respondents in
 the indicated demographic categories.

 52 KAHNEMAN/SCHKADE/SUNSTEIN

 The high correlations shown in Table 5 imply only that the relationships between the

 mean judgments of disjoint demographic groups are well described by linear functions.
 They do not preclude systematic differences between groups in their use of the response
 scales. Thus, one group could be generally more punitive than another even if the two
 make the same discriminations among scenarios. Groups may also differ in the extent to

 which they discriminate between cases, yielding different variability over cases.

 To test for differences between the mean responses of different groups we performed a

 multivariate ANOVA for each response mode, with firm size as a between subjects factor,
 scenario as a within subject factor, and dummy variables for various demographic groups
 as covariates. There were no significant differences between demographic groups, with the

 important exception of gender. Although the mean judgments of men and women are very
 highly correlated, women were somewhat more severe than men: they expressed higher
 outrage ratings (a mean difference of .52 scale units, p < .001), higher punishment ratings
 (difference of .37,/? < .001), and set higher log damage awards (p < .01). There was also
 a gender X scenario interaction in which women assigned even higher ratings of outrage
 and punishment (but not higher dollar awards) to cases in which the plaintiff was female
 ( p < .05).

 In summary, we have evidence of a remarkable degree of consensus on the relative

 outrage evoked by scenarios of personal injury and on the relative severity of the pun-
 ishment that is considered appropriate in this class of cases. This conclusion may not fully

 generalize to all domains of the law. We might expect to find much larger differences in
 the level of judged severity between communities and social categories in other areas,

 perhaps including attitudes to sexual harassment and civil rights violations, although there
 could still be agreement across categories on the relative severity of different instances
 within a domain.

 3.1.4. From outrage to punishment: The harm effect. In the outrage model of Figure 1,
 morally objectionable actions evoke a graded response of outrage or indignation. An
 action can be judged more or less outrageous without reference to its consequences.
 Consequences, however, are important to punishment in law, and we suspected that they
 would also be important to lay intuitions about the proper punishment for reprehensible
 actions. This prediction was tested in Part 3 of the questionnaire, where different respon-
 dents encountered versions of the same scenario that differed in the harm that the plaintiff

 had suffered.

 The results are summarized in the three panels of Figure 2. In each panel, the mean

 response to each high-harm scenario is plotted against the mean response to the low-harm
 version of the same scenario. Because outrage is assumed to be independent of conse-

 quences, our model predicts that the points should fall near the identity line. This pre-
 diction is confirmed. An analysis of variance shows no main effect of harm on outrage

 ratings. A different pattern is found for the punishment measure, which is displayed in the
 middle panel of Figure 2. Here the points all fall above the identity line, indicating that
 punishment ratings reflect the severity of the harm as well as the outrageousness of the
 action that caused it. The effect of harm is small, but statistically reliable ( F = 7.4 , p <

 .01). Because the outrage model involves a cascade of judgments, the effect of harm on

 punitive intent is expected to transfer to dollar awards as well, and indeed there is a
 statistically significant effect of harm on the natural log of damage awards (F = 4.4. p <
 .05). There is also a Harm X Firm Size interaction (F = 6.6, p < .01) in which the effect
 of Harm on log awards is enhanced for large firms.

 3.1.5 . From punitive intent to dollar awards: The effect of firm size. Within the academic

 community, opinion is sharply divided on the question whether the amount of punitive
 awards should depend on the size of the defendant firm (Polinsky and Shavell, 1997;
 Galanter and Luban, 1993). Lay intuitions, in contrast, are quite clear. In the outrage
 model, punitive intent is an intention to inflict pain; this means that the size of the
 defendant matters a good deal. Concepts such as "attracting the attention" of a corporation
 or inflicting pain on it are quite meaningful in everyday language, although philosophers,
 economists and legal scholars may find these concepts elusive. To ridinary people it seems

 intuitively obvious that it takes a louder message to attract the attention of a large firm and

 a larger loss to inflict pain on it. The outrage model therefore implies that the same intent

 to punish will be translated into a larger punitive award if the defendant firm is large than
 if it is small.

 The four panels of Figure 3 present the relevant data. The logic of the display is the
 same as in Figure 2: the mean judgment for the large-firm version of each scenario is
 plotted against the mean judgment for the medium-firm version of the same scenario. The

 outrage model predicts that firm size should have no effect on ratings of outrage or intent
 to punish, or on the likelihood of deciding to make a non-zero award. Indeed, the data for
 all three measures fall symmetrically about and close to the identity line. In contrast, a
 large effect of firm size is apparent in the fourth panel. Analyses of variance yield a
 significant effect of firm size on log awards ( F = 4.8, p = .03) and also on raw dollar
 awards (F = 6.1, p = .01).

 The data reported in this section confirm the existence of broadly shared social norms
 about the acceptable behavior of firms (see also Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler, 1986).
 They also lend strong support to the outrage model of punitive awards, which modulates
 a basic evaluation of a defendant's action by incorporating an evaluation of the harm that

 was caused to the plaintiff, and of the amount of loss that may be required to inflict an
 intended level of pain on a defendant.

 The analyses presented so far were concerned entirely with the average judgments of

 the general public, and of sub-populations within it. At this level of aggregation we found
 consensus on social norms, and also concluded that the outrage model provides a rather
 precise account of moral judgments. However, there is considerable variability and skew-

 ness in individual judgments of dollar awards, and therefore also in the average judgments
 of small samples of people. Variability, especially the possibility of a very large award, is
 a critical problem in the world of legal practice, because juries are small samples. The next
 section is concerned with an analysis of variability.

 3.2. The unpredictability of dollar awards

 A central goal of the present study was to understand the causes of unpredictability in
 punitive damage awards. Our main hypothesis was that the mapping of punitive intent
 onto a dollar scale is a major cause of unpredictability, because of the highly skewed
 distribution of responses associated with magnitude scales. We expected to find much less
 variability and little skewness in the mapping of outrage and punitive intent onto category

 scales, because these scales are bounded, and because descriptive labels guide respondents
 in the task of finding a response that expresses their intentions. In the following sections
 we present several analyses that compare these judgments.

 3.2.1. Measuring unpredictability: Variance analysis. Our main concern is the extent to
 which the respondents in our study (and jurors in the real world) share the same evalua-
 tions of various scenarios involving tortious behavior by a defendant. In the ideal case, all
 respondents would agree in their evaluations of each scenario. Differences among see-

 subjects.

 narios would be the only source of variance in judgments - in this ideal situation there is
 only signal, no noise. In a non-ideal world, however, we expect to observe variance from
 two other sources: (1) individual differences in the average response to scenarios, and (2)
 "noise," which combines idiosyncratic responses of individuals to particular scenarios
 with pure measurement error. The proportion of total variance that is accounted for by

 scenarios provides a useful index of the extent to which judgments approximate the ideal
 of complete consensus. Table 6 presents the values of this index for the three responses
 used in the present study, and for some transformations of these responses.

 To produce the values shown in Table 6, separate analyses of variance were conducted

 for each group of respondents who were exposed to the same combination of 10 of the 28
 different scenarios. The values shown are a weighted average of the results obtained in
 these homogeneous groups. Ratings of outrage and punishment show much higher con-
 sensus than dollar awards. Indeed, only 6% of the variance of dollar awards is associated
 with scenarios. Similar results were reported by Kahneman and Ritov (1994), who com-
 pared willingness to pay for various causes (a magnitude sale) to category scale measures
 of related attitudes.

 Dollar awards exhibit all the characteristics that are expected of magnitude scaling
 without a modulus, where each respondent in effect adopts a personal modulus. Individual
 differences in this modulus combined with the proportionality between individual means
 and standard deviations are expected to produce a high correlation between the mean and
 the standard deviations of respondents' judgments: if two individuals agree in their un-
 derlying impressions but their moduli differ by a factor, both the means and the standard
 deviations of their expressed judgments will differ by the same factor. For each group of
 respondents who saw the same set of 10 scenarios we computed the correlation between
 the mean and the standard deviation of the 10 responses made by each individual. As
 expected, this correlation was very high for dollar awards (an average of correlation of
 .90), but small for outrage ratings and (an average of .16) and punishment ratings (an
 average of .09).

 Second, we observe that the distributions of awards are highly skewed to the right, for

 each of the 28 scenarios. We trace the skewness to two sources: the characteristic skew-

 ness of all magnitude judgments (Stevens, 1975), and the skewness in the distribution of
 personal moduli. We computed skewness statistics for non-zero awards for each scenario

 for each group of respondents exposed to the same 10 scenarios, using the standard a3
 skewness measure.2 Dollar award distributions were highly skewed to the right (an aver-

 age skewness statistic of 3.57), while outrage ratings (an average of - .30) and punishment
 ratings (average of -.13) showed little skewness. To estimate the skewness of personal
 moduli, we computed the skewness index of the distribution of the means and of the

 standard deviations of positive individual responses, within each of the groups who saw
 the same set of scenarios. The average skewness was 4.00 for the means and 3.59 for the

 standard deviations. Finally, we generated a new set of judgments for each scenario within

 each group of respondents, by dividing all the positive responses of an individual by that
 individual's mean response. This transformation is an attempt to eliminate the effects of

 individual differences in moduli on the distribution of judgments. The average skewness

 of judgments within scenarios is now 1.35. This value is positive, reflecting the intrinsic
 skewness expected for magnitude judgments obtained with a specified modulus, but is

 much lower than the skewness of untransformed judgments. We conclude that the extreme

 skewness observed in the judgments of particular scenarios is mainly due to the skewed
 distribution of personal moduli.

 In a further test of the hypothesis that the poor performance of the dollar measure is
 attributable to individual differences in moduli, we transformed each individual's 10

 judgments to ranks. The ranking transformation eliminates individual differences in the
 use of the scale, while retaining the essential comparative information contained in the

 judgments. The transformation yielded a dramatic improvement in the predictability of
 dollar awards: the proportion of systematic variance rises from .06 to .51. In contrast, a

 ranking transformation yielded only a modest improvement in the proportion of scenario-

 related variance for outrage and punishment ratings. This pattern of results reinforces the

 conclusion that the unpredictability of raw dollar awards is produced primarily by large
 (and possibly meaningless) individual differences in the use of the dollar scale.

 A logarithmic transformation of dollar awards also yields a dramatic improvement in

 the proportion of variance accounted for by scenarios. This result is to be expected for a
 magnitude scale. The transformation of awards to logs essentially eliminates the charac-
 teristic skewness of the distribution of judgments on these scales. Indeed, in their careful
 analysis of the predictability of actual punitive damage awards, Eisenberg et al (1997)
 showed that the logarithmic transformation yields a distribution that is almost normal.
 They also showed that the log of awards is predicted reasonably well from a set of
 objective characteristics of cases in which such awards were made. Eisenberg et al con-
 cluded that the unpredictability of punitive awards has been overstated. We find no in-

 consistency between their analyses of real jury awards and our experimental data. Indeed,
 we agree with their conclusion that log awards are reasonably predictable. Defendants and
 plaintiffs, however, live in a world of dollars, not log dollars. In terms of dollars the
 judgments of our respondents and of the real juries examined by Eisenberg et al are
 correctly described as erratic and unpredictable, because the high variability and severe
 skewness creates the possibility of disastrous losses which might induce risk aversion
 even in very large firms.

 3.3. Synthetic jury analyses

 The unpredictability that is of interest to the legal system concerns the award decision of

 a group of twelve (and sometimes fewer) citizens, who are given considerable information
 about a single case, and an opportunity to debate it at length. The circumstances of our
 experiment are of course quite different. The presence of multiple jurors provides the

 possibility of mitigating high individual variability to some extent through aggregation. In
 an attempt not to overstate the variability that is the object of our study, we chose to

 analyze the judgments of synthetic juries, derived from the responses of the individual

 respondents. The 'jury judgments' that we analyze are obtained by randomly selecting a
 group of 12 individuals, using the median response in the group as an estimate of the
 judgment that a jury composed of these 12 individuals would have rendered.

 Our decision to use the median of individual judgments as an estimate is based on

 research findings which suggest that this statistic provides the best available estimate of
 the decision that is likely to emerge from group deliberations (Davis, 1996).3 Diamond

 and Casper (1992) report an extensive examination of juror-jury relationships for com-

 pensatory damages in a price-fixing case. They also found that the median of the prede-

 liberation responses of individual jurors was a better predictor of mock jury verdicts than
 either the mean or the mode.

 There is no reason to believe that our main findings would be altered by the process of

 group deliberation. The conclusion of a now considerable literature using a wide variety

 of tasks is that deliberating groups hold no generalized advantage over individuals in the

 performance of judgment tasks (Kerr, MacCoun and Kramer, 1996). More specifically,
 Kerr, MacCoun and Kramer (1996) concluded from their review of judgmental biases in
 legal contexts that jury deliberations were actually slightly more likely to amplify the
 biases of individuals than to attenuate them. In the jury damage assessment context,
 Diamond and Casper's (1992) mock jury awards were significantly higher than the mean
 individual award (by 26%), a finding mirrored qualitatively in other studies (Davis, 1996,
 experiment 1; Kaplan and Miller, 1987, for punitive but not compensatory damages). If
 this effect applies to our study as well, the right-skewed distribution of damage awards in
 our data would cause our synthetic jury judgments to underestimate both the mean and the
 variance of the awards that that deliberating juries would have made. However, in a study
 with student mock-jurors Davis et al (1997) found that the median somewhat overesti-
 mated actual group judgments. While the relationship between individual judgments and
 that of the groups they compose is still an evolving area of research, this evidence
 suggests that the results we observe in our synthetic juries provide a reasonable and
 conservative approximation to the results that would be observed with real juries.

 We created synthetic juries by randomly selecting groups of 12 respondents, with
 replacement, in each condition and for each scenario, and used the median of the 12
 responses to represent the jury judgment (the size of the pool from which juries were
 drawn varied from 144 to 151 in Part 1-2 scenarios and from 64 to 77 in Part 3 scenarios).
 One thousand simulated juries were created in this fashion for each scenario and condi-
 tion.

 Median 2.18

 Table 7 presents, for each of the scenarios used in the study, the median and the lower

 and upper bounds of a 95% confidence interval for the awards of simulated dollar juries,

 as well as the mean ratings of simulated punishment juries. The first observation is that the
 unpredictability and characteristic skewness of jury dollar awards is readily replicated
 under laboratory conditions.4 Note that the extreme variability of awards is especially
 striking for the most severe cases. As noted earlier, this result could be anticipated from
 similar observations with magnitude scales in the context of psychophysics, where the
 standard deviation of judgments is commonly found to be proportional to the mean
 (Stevens, 1975). In the data of Table 8, the width of the confidence interval is highly
 correlated with both the mean ( r = .90) and the median (r = .87) of dollar awards.

 3.3.1 . Measuring unpredictability: correlational analysis. Jury judgments can be con-
 sidered predictable, in our use of that term, if there is high agreement between juries
 randomly selected from the population. We carried out an analysis that compares the

 predictability of the judgments made by simulated dollar juries, outrage juries and pun-
 ishment juries. The basic unit of this analysis is a set of 28 jury judgments, one each for
 each of the 28 scenarios listed in Table 7. Except for the possibility of the same individu-

 als appearing in more than one jury, this procedure simulates the convening of indepen-
 dent juries to deal with 28 separate cases on the same day. Using this procedure, we
 created 60 sets of 28 simulated jury judgments for each response mode, where each
 judgment was contributed by a different jury. We then computed the Pearson correlation
 between each pair of sets. This computation was performed both within response (e.g., the
 correlation between the outrage ratings of successive juries) and across responses (e.g.,
 the correlation between the outrage rating of one jury and the punishment rating of
 another). The data shown in Table 8 are medians of the 1770 correlations obtained within
 each response mode or of the 3600 correlations obtained between two response modes.
 The results of Table 8 conform to our hypothesis. There is strong agreement between

 independent synthetic juries judging outrage or punishment on category scales (r = .87
 and .89). In contrast, agreement between independent synthetic juries judging dollar
 awards on a magnitude scale is quite weak (r = .42). Evidently, the individual variability
 and skewness of judgments on this measure is so large than even the medians of 12
 judgments are unstable. The problem could be reduced, of course, by taking larger
 samples. For example, we found that when the size of the juries is increased to 30, the
 correlation between the dollar awards of independent sets of juries rises to .80. However,
 the problem would be exacerbated in smaller samples, such as juries of size 6 or 8.

 A jury can be thought of as a sample from the community, whose function is to provide
 an estimate of community sentiment. In the context of our experiment, community sen-
 timent about the punitive damages for a scenario will be defined as the median of the
 damages set by all the respondents who judged it. The bottom row of Table 8 presents the
 correlations between sets of simulated jury judgments for the 28 scenarios and corre-
 sponding estimates of community sentiment, for which we used the overall median of
 dollar awards for each scenario. Remarkably, punishment juries predict community sen-
 timent about dollar awards more accurately than dollar juries do. This superior accuracy

 is especially notable because, as will be shown below, the relationship between dollar
 awards and ratings of punitive intent is highly non-linear.

 3.3.2. Improving predictability. As noted above, the judgments of dollar juries can be
 viewed as estimates of community sentiment about the punitive award that is appropriate

 in a given case. The accuracy with which a dollar jury estimates community sentiment can
 be assessed by computing the difference between the jury's award and a measure of

 community sentiment, for which we use the overall median of individual dollar awards.
 The root-mean-square of these discrepancies (RMSE) across juries, calculated separately
 for each scenario, provides a measure of average prediction error that is analogous to the
 standard error of the estimate in a regression.

 Hypothesis 5 states, and the correlational analysis summarized in the preceding section
 implies, that punishment juries can be used to obtain more accurate estimates of com-
 munity sentiment about dollar awards than dollar juries themselves can provide. To ex-
 amine this possibility, we proceed as follows. Using the entire sample, we first estimate
 the functions that relate the overall median of dollar awards for a given scenario to the
 mean judgment of all simulated punishment juries for that scenario (see Figure 4). Next,
 we create punishment juries according to the re-sampling procedure described above, and
 use the median punishment rating of the 12 individuals as the simulated jury judgment.
 We then use the relevant function from Figure 4 to convert the judgment of each punish-
 ment jury into a dollar award. As before, the computed awards are treated as estimates of
 the overall median of dollar awards, and we use RMSE as an index of the accuracy of
 these estimates.

 As can be seen in Figure 4, the relationship between punishment ratings and dollar
 awards is highly non-linear. On the background of previous psychophysical scaling re-
 search, this result is not surprising. Stevens (1975) pointed out that magnitude scales are
 generally related to category scales of the same underlying variable by a power function.
 Following Stevens, we therefore fitted (separately for medium and large firms) conversion
 functions of the following form:

 A = af* + e (1)

 where DÂ¿ = median jury award for scenario /, and PÂ¿ = mean jury punishment for scenario

 i. Mean punishment ratings lower than 1 .5 were interpreted as intending no punishment,
 and a prediction of $0 was made for these scenarios. Conversion functions were estimated
 on those scenarios that exceeded this threshold, and produced good fits (. R 2 = .96 and .88

 for medium and large firms, respectively). We specified a squared error loss function and
 estimated a and b using a nonlinear numerical search routine. Figure 4 presents the data
 and the estimated functions for this analysis.

 To assess the relative quality of the estimates from jury dollar awards and from con-

 verted punishment ratings, we created 100 juries of 12 individuals for each response mode
 and each scenario, in the same fashion as before (with replacement) and computed an
 estimate of the population median of dollar awards. For dollar juries, this estimate was
 simply the median of the twelve individual responses. For punishment juries, the median
 of individual responses was converted to an estimated dollar award using the conversion
 function for the appropriate firm size. The squared differences between these estimates
 and the observed median dollar award for each scenario were summed across the 100

 juries. Finally, we computed for each scenario the ratio of the RMSE for dollar awards to
 the RMSE for converted punishment ratings. The last column of Table 7 presents these
 ratios, which we use as a summary statistic of the relative accuracy of the two estimation
 procedures.

 As is apparent from the large ratios (the median ratio is 2.18), the estimates derived

 from punishment ratings are far more accurate than estimates from dollar awards. For
 example, for the case of Joan with a medium firm size and high harm, the ratio is 2.27
 (Table 7), the median individual award is $1,000,000 (Table 4), and the estimates of dollar
 juries have an average error from this value of $913,481 compared to $402,414 for
 estimates based on punishment juries. A difference in this direction was found for 25 of
 the 28 scenarios. These results support the rather counter-intuitive conclusion that the goal
 of estimating community sentiment about dollar awards can be achieved more efficiently

 by asking juries to rate their intent to punish than by asking them to set dollar awards -
 provided of course that the requisite conversion function is available.

 4. Discussion

 The research we have reported was designed with three objectives in mind: (i) to learn
 about the psychology of punitive damages; (ii) to understand why punitive damages are
 sometimes arbitrary and unpredictable; (iii) to consider possible reforms in the task
 assigned to the jury, which might reduce this uncertainty. We discuss the three objectives
 in turn.

 4.1. The psychology of damage awards

 We have presented a model in which judgments about punitive awards are interpreted as
 a succession of mappings. The core of the model is an emotion of outrage, which we have

 PSYCHOLOGY OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES 73

 made no attempt to analyze in this research - we were content with measuring it. This
 elementary internal state is a central determinant of the responses to many other questions
 that could be asked about the same incident: for example the emotion that is expressed in
 a rating of appropriate punishment or in setting dollar awards would also affect evalua-
 tions of the image of a defendant firm and of the character of individual defendants.
 Although many questions about the case would evoke the same emotion, each question

 also raises a particular set of considerations. The outrage model is a particular type of
 attitude structure in which several internal states or responses are organized in a chain of
 increasing complexity; a more complex response depends on all the factors that affected
 its predecessor in the chain, and also on some new factors. In this structure the emotion
 of outrage is basic, punitive intent is intermediate and overt judgments of dollar awards

 are most complex. The determinants that affect any link in this chain are a superset of the
 determinants of earlier links.

 We have identified some of the determinants of punitive intent and of dollar awards, but

 the list we offered is not complete. For example, the harm suffered by plaintiff is surely
 not the only factor that influences punitive intent beyond outrage. In particular, the des-
 ignation of an action as a repeated offense could well produce a more severe punishment
 even if it does not increase the outrageousness of the act. Similarly, firm size is surely not
 the only factor that affects dollar awards beyond punitive intent. Numerical anchors are
 another likely candidate. Because there is no obvious way to determine what it might take
 to punish a company "severely" or "very severely", the mapping from punishment to
 dollars is likely to be highly susceptible to suggestions from other people and to arbitrary
 anchors (Chapman and Bornstein, 1996; Hastie, Schkade and Payne, 1997). Indeed, we
 cannot reject the interpretation that the firm size effect that we observed in the present

 study was produced by anchoring on the numbers that were provided to characterize firms

 of different sizes. More generally, we view the outrage model not as a finished product but
 as a framework for future investigation of the intuitions that jurors bring to their task.
 The normative status of the outrage model raises difficult questions. On the one hand,

 this model appears to capture moral norms that are widely shared in society. On the other

 hand, there are reasons to question whether the social norms that produce outrage deserve
 to be honored by the legal system in awarding punitive damages. The backward-looking,
 retributive focus of outrage is not well-suited to the deterrence function that many legal
 theorists view as the main justification for punitive damages (Landes and Posner, 1993;
 Polinsky and Shavell, 1997). Those who emphasize deterrence generally urge that punitive
 damages should be awarded to make up for the likelihood that some acts will not be
 detected and punished. This idea is not represented in the outrage model. Indeed, we
 suspect that the brazen actions of an agent that commits reprehensible acts in the full light
 of day may occasion more outrage than the actions of a more surreptitious perpetrator.
 Thus, efforts to make punitive awards serve deterrent goals will run up against the
 intuitions that jurors bring to their role. Legitimate questions can also be raised about the
 intuitions that treat corporations as persons, and large corporations as big and powerful
 persons. In some areas, legislatures committed to retribution may want to question the
 social norms of lay persons. We return to these issues below, where we raise the possibility
 of a radical change in the role of juries in setting punitive awards.

 4.2. A cause of unpredictable awards

 The task of setting punitive damages most closely resembles a particular psychophysical
 method, which we have labeled magnitude scaling without a modulus. As was noted
 earlier, subjects in most applications of magnitude scaling are instructed to assign a
 particular number (the modulus) to a specified standard stimulus, and to judge other
 stimuli in terms of ratios of subjective intensity relative to that standard. The modulus is

 both arbitrary and inconsequential: the same ratio scales will be obtained regardless of
 whether the standard stimulus is to be judged 10 or 100. However, magnitude scaling can
 also be conducted without a modulus, by instructing subjects to ensure that their judg-

 ments of different stimuli should reflect the ratios of the intensity of subjective experience.

 In the context of psychophysical scaling (e.g., of loudness), the procedure yields scales
 that are quite similar to those that are obtained in the standard method, though somewhat
 noisier and more skewed. It appears that a subject in such an experiment spontaneously

 adopts a modulus - and different subjects adopt different moduli. Naturally, this procedure

 greatly increases the variability and skewness of the numerical responses to any given
 stimulus. The effects of individual differences in the size of the modulus are easily
 eliminated in the statistical analysis of psychophysical data, where each observer judges

 many stimuli. Under current legal practice, this remedy is not available, since each jury
 considers only one case in isolation, and indeed is explicitly prohibited from comparing
 it to others.

 The close similarity of our results to the pattern observed in psychophysical tasks raises

 two questions: (i) what is the significance of individual differences in the overall magni-
 tude of responses? (ii) what is the status of the average of the judgments assigned to a

 given scenario (or stimulus)? In the context of psychophysics, the answers to these ques-

 tions are (i) individual differences in the size of responses reflect differences in the choice
 of an arbitrary modulus; and (ii) the average responses to any single stimulus are also
 largely arbitrary, although the ratios of responses to different stimuli are meaningful.

 Do these conclusions also apply to the setting of punitive damages in our study? Was

 the mapping from punitive intent to dollars as labile and arbitrary in our experiment as it
 would be in a psychophysical experiment? In the present study, individual differences in
 the overall magnitude of awards need not be completely arbitrary: they could reflect
 genuine differences of opinion about the punitive effects of punitive damages, that is, in

 the amount required to engage the attention of negligent firms or to inflict pain on them.

 The data of the present study do not permit us to estimate how much of the variability of
 dollar awards is due to such systematic effects. However, there are several reasons to
 believe that arbitrary differences in individual choices of modulus play a major role. The
 first is the evidence indicating the great sensitivity of punitive awards to anchors of
 dubious informative value. In addition, we have seen that the mapping of punitive intent
 onto dollars raises normative and conceptual problems that present a challenge to the
 expert. It is likely that lay persons faced with these problems will make rather arbitrary
 choices. The normative relevance of dollar damage awards is limited by the extent to
 which the moduli used by jurors are arbitrary.

 PSYCHOLOGY OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES 75

 We have considerable confidence in the conclusion that arbitrary differences in the use
 of the dollar scale were an important cause of the unpredictability of dollar juries in our

 study. A more difficult question concerns the possibility of extrapolating from the artificial
 circumstances of the present experiment to the real legal world. The critical fact, we
 propose, is that actual juries and the participants in our experiments share the task of
 mapping punitive intent onto an unbounded scale, with no specified standards to guide
 them. Under these circumstances we expect judgments to be highly labile, and therefore
 susceptible to any anchors that may be provided in the course of the trial or in jury
 deliberations.

 A final note of caution is in order here. The fact that punitive damages share the known
 deficiencies of magnitude scaling is likely to be a significant cause of unpredictable
 punitive awards - but it is not the only one. Other relevant factors include regional dif-
 ferences, plaintiffs demand, the quality of the lawyers on both sides, and doubtless others.

 4.3. Implications for legal reform

 In spite of the acknowledged limitations of our experiment, we believe that our findings
 have substantial implications for reforms of the role of juries in setting punitive awards.
 Of course the decision of whether and how the current system should be reformed must
 be guided by a normative analysis of the social and legal function of punitive damages. In
 the subsequent discussion we distinguish among three canonical positions, which differ in
 the diagnosis of the principal weakness of the current system, and imply different rec-
 ommendations for how it might be improved. The issues raised in the following sections
 are discussed in greater detail in Sunstein, Kahneman and Schkade (1998). In that paper,
 we also discuss other reform proposals, such as damage caps, compensatory damage
 multipliers, and an increased supervisory role for judges.

 4.3.1. High variability of dollar awards. The first and least radical of the three positions
 we shall discuss assumes that the only problem with the punitive awards made by juries
 is that they are erratic and unpredictable, because of the large individual differences
 between jurors in the mapping of punitive intent into dollars. In this view the "community
 sentiment" about the appropriate dollar punishment in a case is the normative standard.

 The task of the jury is simply to reflect this sentiment, which we have operationalized here
 as the median of the judgments that would be made if the entire eligible popÃºfation
 participated in setting dollar awards. The problem of unpredictability arises from an
 identifiable source: a sample of twelve is too small to provide an accurate estimate of
 community sentiment, because of the large individual differences in the mapping of
 punitive intent. The goal of reform is merely to obtain a more accurate understanding of
 that sentiment.

 How might this problem be solved? The analysis that we described in Section 3.3.2
 showed that asking juries to assess severity of punishment, and converting this assessment
 to dollars by a conversion function leads to much greater accuracy (by a factor of more
 than 2 in these data) than asking juries to set dollar awards. The procedure of this

 76 KAHNEMAN/SCHKADE/SUNSTEIN

 experiment provides a blueprint for a manageable program of research and reform that
 could yield a substantial improvement in the predictability of jury awards.

 In the first phase of such reform, a set of fictitious but realistic scenarios would be
 generated - perhaps several sets corresponding to different types of case, such as personal
 injury or financial misconduct. These cases would be presented to a large number of
 individuals (or experimental juries) to obtain estimates of population norms. Some of the

 respondents would set dollar awards. Others would provide a rating of punitive intent, or
 perhaps rank the scenarios by this variable.5 The results of this study would provide a
 conversion function that could subsequently be used in real cases to transform jury ratings
 of punishment (or their ranking of the case at hand in a standard set of calibrated cases)

 into dollar awards. The analysis that we reported can be seen as a partial simulation of this

 new procedure. As we have seen, the results of this simulation suggests that error variance

 can be reduced by changing the jury's task to set punishment in more abstract terms (by
 rating or by ranking), and avoiding the less manageable task of setting dollar awards.
 Specifically, we found that it is possible to exploit the error pattern of category scales
 (where the error variability and the mean are not generally correlated) to achieve a more

 accurate estimate of community sentiment than the current system of asking juries to set
 dollar awards can provide.

 The proposed procedure raises many questions of implementation. From the normative

 point of view, however, it is straightforward because it accepts the principle that punitive
 damages should reflect the central tendency of community sentiment. This is a quite
 modest critique of the existing system, and as a reform proposal it represents a modest
 change, providing improved estimates of community judgments about dollar amounts
 without questioning the normative force of those judgments.

 If we pursue this perspective, then other means of improving the quality of our estimate

 of community sentiment can be considered as well. For example, one possibility sug-
 gested to us by Dan McFadden involves adding the observed mean damage award of the
 relevant category (e.g., personal injury cases) to the jury judgment as a second predictor
 of the community median. This approach can further reduce error variance by capitalizing
 on the stability of the category mean. Also, we did not study other possible measures of
 punitive intent and it is possible that further investigation could identify an even more
 stable and reliable scale, which would further improve the prediction of community
 sentiment about dollar awards. Many new possibilities are opened by raising the question
 "How can we obtain the best estimate of community sentiment?"

 %

 4.3.2. Inadequate calibration of dollar awards. A more radical critique would argue that
 the legal system should deny the normative status of community sentiment about dollar
 awards, but accept community sentiment about punitive intent. If the translation of puni-
 tive intent onto the dollar scale is arbitrary and poorly informed, the goal of the jury

 system should not be to predict community sentiment about dollars - even if this predic-
 tion could be made accurate.

 On this view, the conversion functions that take punitive intent to dollars (see Figure 4)

 reflect intuitions about appropriate dollar awards that are neither informed nor particularly
 reasonable. Even if it is granted that the jury is sovereign is deciding how much an

 individual or a corporation should be made to "suffer", what knowledge do jurors have
 that would enable them to convert their punitive intent into a particular dollar number?
 Even experts would find that question difficult to answer. As we have seen, it is quite
 plausible that individuals and juries answer it by generating arbitrary moduli, or by
 clinging to numerical anchors provided in the information they receive. If community
 sentiment on awards is seen as representing the averaged effects of arbitrary individual
 moduli, another procedure will be required to translate punitive intent into dollar awards.
 The proposal that naturally emerges from this analysis again involves a two-phase

 determination of punitive awards. As before, juries should be asked to provide a rating or
 a ranking of the case at hand on a scale of punitive intent, as in the preceding proposal.
 However, the conversion function from punishment to dollars would be generated by a
 legislative or regulatory process, not by the empirical mapping from one measure of
 community sentiment to another. The conversion function would take into consideration

 the factors that affect community judgment, such as firm size, but it would be based on an
 informed analysis of the harm that different levels of damage would cause. The availabil-
 ity of a formal scheme to convert punitive intent into dollars would not only reduce the
 unpredictability of awards; it is also likely to make them more fair and more reasonable.

 4.3.3. Rejecting the outrage model A still more radical critique of the current system
 could draw on our findings about the moral intuitions that are embodied in the outrage
 model. Our results suggest that these intuitions have a backward-looking, retributive
 focus; that they appear to neglect issues of deterrence; that they treat corporations as
 persons; and that they require punitive damages to be sensitive to the financial status of

 the defendant. From the normative standpoint, some people have questioned each of these
 aspects of the outrage model. Many observers believe that the social function of punitive
 damages should be deterrence, not retribution (Landes and Posner, 1993; Polinsky and
 Shavell, 1997). The view of the corporation as a person is problematic, and perhaps less
 than perfectly robust: would potential jurors be swayed by the information that the people
 who ultimately pay the punitive damages are stockholders, employees, and customers,
 most of them individually powerless to change the behavior of the corporation? Questions
 have also been raised about the justification for the common intuition that punitive dam-
 ages should be adjusted to the size of the defendant.

 It appears that jurors bring to their task some strongly ingrained and broadly shared

 moral intuitions, which may not correspond to the actual or appropriate legal principles.
 Accepting this position not only denies the legitimacy of dollar awards; it also denies the

 legitimacy of the punitive intent of the community. Could jury instructions point the jury
 in the right direction? Perhaps; but a large literature on the difficulty of changing attitudes

 suggests that the intuitions of the outrage model are likely to affect jurors' thinking, even
 in the face of explicit instructions to the contrary (see Hastie, Schkade and Payne, forth-
 coming).

 If accepted, the logic of this analysis would lead to a proposal that appears radical in the
 special context of American legal tradition and practice: Juries should not be assigned the
 task of setting punitive damages, because they are unlikely to carry out their task appro-
 priately in light of the best understanding of the goal of punitive awards. It follows that the

 task of determining the size of awards should be turned over to judges or to some
 administrative process. If a jury is used at all, its function would be to make a judgment
 about the outrageousness of the defendant's behavior, which would be used as one of

 several inputs in a punitive decision that would be made by some other person or agency
 (see Sunstein, Kahneman and Schkade, 1998).

 5. Concluding remarks

 We have shown that the difficulty of mapping punitive intent onto dollar amounts is a

 potentially important source of unpredictability in punitive damages. The variability of the

 dollar response contrasts with another important observation: there is substantial agree-

 ment in the population with respect to judgments of both outrage and punishment, and the
 consensus operates across differences of gender, race, age, education, and income. This

 substantial consensus on outrage and punitive intent make them predictable, while dollar
 awards are much less so.

 This finding leads naturally to some specific reform proposals. In particular, it suggests

 that any effort to improve predictability in the award of punitive damages will be most

 successful if it assists with the task of mapping outrage and punitive intent onto a dollar

 scale. A conversion formula might well be adopted to provide this assistance. The content

 of the conversion formula depends on the normative status that is accorded to community

 sentiments. As we have seen, different recommendations for reform emerge from three

 different diagnoses of the problem: (i) dollar awards are susceptible to excessive sampling

 error; (ii) the mapping of punitive intent to dollars is poorly informed; (iii) the judgments

 of jurors are likely to be affected by outrage and by retributive urges that are not in line

 with appropriately designed legal principles.

 Our findings have implications well beyond the area of punitive damages, because the

 legal system is pervasively in the business of requiring people to map normative judg-
 ments onto dollar amounts. Our analysis suggests that the mapping of attitudes onto
 unbounded scales creates problems that are both predictable and severe. We suspect, for

 instance, that similar difficulties exist in the setting of awards for pain and suffering, libel,
 and civil rights violations, and in attempts to use measures of willingness to pay to
 estimate the value of public goods.6 There is a need to develop mechanisms for eliciting
 social preferences and values that do not suffer from the problems and defects identified
 here. We do not expect to find an uncontroversial way of eliciting, or constructing, social
 preferences and values, but some approaches to this important task are demonstrably
 worse than others, because they make people perform tasks for which they are ill-
 equipped. The problems we have identified and the solutions we have sketched here are
 likely to be relevant to many questions currently facing law and policy.

 6. Appendix I: Excerpts from instructions

 In this study we would like you to imagine that you are a juror for a legal case in a civil
 court. Civil law suits can involve disputes between private individuals, companies, or
 individuals and companies, in which the plaintiff alleges that the defendant harmed them
 or their property in some way. A civil suit is brought by a plaintiff for the purpose of
 gaining compensation from the defendant for the alleged harm.

 Civil suits involve two different types of penalties that could be imposed upon a
 defendant that is found liable for damages. Compensatory damages are intended to fully
 compensate a plaintiff for the harm suffered as a result of the defendant's actions. Punitive
 damages are intended to achieve two purposes: (1) to punish the defendant for unusual
 misconduct, and (2) to deter the defendant and others from committing the same actions
 in the future.

 In the cases you will consider, the defendant has already been ordered to pay compen-

 satory damages to the plaintiff. This does not necessarily mean that punitive damages
 must also be awarded. Whether or not punitive damages should be awarded and, if so, how
 large they should be, is completely separate from compensatory damages.

 Punitive damages should be awarded if a preponderance of the evidence shows that the
 defendants either acted maliciously or with reckless disregard for the welfare of others.
 Defendants are considered to have acted maliciously if they intended to injure or harm
 someone. Defendants are considered to have acted with reckless disregard for the welfare
 of others if they were aware of the probable harm to others but disregarded it, and their
 actions were a gross deviation from the standard of care that a normal person would use.
 Civil suits differ from criminal cases, in which the government prosecutes an individual

 or a company for alleged violations of the law. Plaintiffs in a civil trial must prove their
 claim by "a preponderance of the evidence," which means that it is more likely than not
 that the plaintiffs claim is justified. This differs from criminal trials, where the prosecu-
 tion must prove the defendant's guilt "beyond a reasonable doubt."

 In each of the cases you will consider, the jury (of which you are a member) has already
 decided to accept the plaintiff's claim. As a consequence the jury has ordered the defen-
 dant to pay $200,000 in compensatory damages to the plaintiff as full compensation. The
 defendants are large [medium-sized] companies with profits of $100-200 [$10-20] mil-
 lion per year.

 7. Appendix II: Personal injury scenarios

 Mary Lawson

 Mary Lawson, a manufacturing worker, developed chronic anemia. Although after a
 hospital stay she is now better, the condition has not been fully cured. She believes that
 exposure to benzene in her work place caused the condition and sued her employer, TGI

 International. The jury (of which you are a member) ordered TGI International to pay her
 $200,000 in compensation.

 TGI International is a large company (with profits of $100-200 million per year) that
 manufactures high-tech machine parts. Some years ago the scientists at TGI International
 discovered that manufacturing workers at Mary Lawson's plant were often exposed to
 benzene, a substance that can cause anemia, leukemia and cancer. Internal documents

 show that the top management at TGI International decided not to do anything about the
 problem, because benzene levels in the plant were slightly below the maximum level
 allowed by OSHA regulations. They thought that the risk was worth taking and that "with
 any luck no one will get sick." They also decided against warning the workers, because
 "warnings would just create panic."

 Frank Williams

 Frank Williams suffered serious internal injuries when the braking system on his motor-

 cycle failed to work at a traffic light. He felt that that the brakes were defective, and sued
 National Motors, the company that manufactures and sells his motorcycle. The jury (of
 which you are a member) ordered National Motors to pay him $200,000 in compensation.
 National Motors is a large company (with profits of $100-200 million per year) that
 makes motorcycles, scooters, and other motorized single person vehicles. The evidence
 showed that the braking system used by National Motors has a basic design defect.
 National Motors was aware that "there might be a problem with our brakes," because in
 pre-market tests, the defect appeared on several occasions. But the pre-market tests were
 not extensive, despite the fact that auto industry regulations require elaborate testing.
 Internal company documents show National Motors' belief that "it would be quite ex-
 pensive for us to do much more now, we can't be certain we have a serious problem here,
 and anyway we can fix the problem afterwards if it really does turn out to be serious."

 Thomas Smith

 While he was visiting the circus, Thomas Smith was shot in the arm by a security guard
 who mistakenly thought that Smith had threatened another customer with bodily harm.
 The security guard was drunk at the time. Smith sued Public Entertainment, the company

 that operates the circus. The jury (of which you are a member) ordered Public Entertain-
 ment to pay him $200,000 in compensation.

 Public Entertainment is a large company (with profits of $100-200 million per year)

 which operates circuses and public fairs. Fred Williams, the security guard who was
 involved in the incident, is an alcoholic with a history of incidents of drunkenness on the

 job. During one of these incidents Williams took out his gun and started waving it around

 wildly, but he did not shoot anyone. Public Entertainment had repeatedly warned Williams

 to "clean up his act" but took no other action. In his company personnel file Williams was
 described as "basically a good guy with a bit of a drinking problem, but not enough of a
 risk to fire him."

 Susan Douglas

 Susan Douglas suffered significant injuries to her legs and neck when an airbag in her car
 opened unexpectedly while she was driving the vehicle. She believes that the airbag was
 defective and sued the manufacturer, Coastal Industries. The jury (of which you are a
 member) ordered Coastal Industries to pay her $200,000 in compensation.

 Coastal Industries is a large company (with profits of $100-200 million per year) that
 specializes in parts and accessories that can be added to existing vehicles, such as adding
 the latest safety equipment to older cars. While its airbag conforms to the requirements
 stated in government regulations, it does not include certain additional "fail-safe" systems
 that are used in other airbags to ensure against accidental opening. Internal documents
 show that most but not all of the Coastal Industries designers believed that their system "is
 certainly safe enough, even if it does not include all possible safeguards" and that their
 marketing department said that "there will be no market for our airbag if we raise its price
 by adding more safety bells and whistles."

 Carl Sanders

 Carl Sanders used Nalene, an over-the-counter baldness treatment available at drugstores.
 While a small amount of hair did grow back, he also developed severe side-effects,
 including open sores on the scalp and permanent brown spots over his forehead. He sued
 the manufacturer, A&G Cosmetics. The jury (of which you are a member) ordered A&G
 Cosmetics to pay him $200,000 in compensation.

 A&G Cosmetics is a large company (with profits of $100-200 million per year) that

 sells many different cosmetic products, including wigs, "weaves" and chemical solutions
 designed to combat baldness. Nalene has proven effective in promoting hair growth in
 30% of people in clinical trials. However, Nalene caused unpleasant side effects in some
 cases, although none were as severe as those Carl Sanders experienced. When marketing
 Nalene, A&G Cosmetics did not fully disclose these findings. It only said "minor side
 effects have been observed in a very small number of people tested." While this amount

 of disclosure was within legal limits, other companies that make hair products voluntarily
 disclosed more about their products.

 Sarah Stanley

 Sarah Stanley, a seventy-five year old woman, suffered serious back injuries as a result of
 following an exercise video, "Good Health For All," that she purchased through her local

 community health center. When Stanley attempted to perform the exercises, she found
 herself unable to do so, but she pressed on beyond her physical capacities. She claimed
 that she was not adequately warned of these dangers and sued the producer of the video,
 Gersten Productions. The jury (of which you are a member) ordered Gersten Productions
 to pay her $200,000 in compensation.

 Gersten Productions is a large company (with profits of $100-200 million per year) that

 produces informational materials in health-related fields, including videos on many topics
 concerning healthy lifestyles. The "Good Health for All" video contains a series of
 exercises suitable mostly for people in good shape and good health. The exercise coaches
 and models in the video are all relatively young, and no federal or state law requires
 exercise videos to come with any special warning for elderly people. The witnesses in the
 case testified that Gersten Productions believed that most people would be able to tell
 when the exercises were beyond their capacities, that Good Health for All has produced
 good results for almost all people who have seen it, and that very few people had reported
 injuries of any type from doing so.

 Jack Newton

 Jack Newton, a five year old child, was playing with matches when his cotton flannel
 pajamas caught fire. He was severely burned over a significant portion of his body and
 required several weeks in the hospital and months of physical therapy. His parents sued
 the manufacturer of the pajamas, Novel Clothing. The jury (of which you are a member)
 ordered Novel Clothing to pay the Newtons $200,000 in compensation.

 Novel Clothing is a large company (profits of $100-200 million per year) that special-

 izes in making clothes for children. Before marketing the pajamas, Novel conducted the
 tests normally used in the industry for problems like flammability, and observed no
 incidents like the Newtons experienced. Companies in the industry as well as federal
 regulators have known for a while that it is possible to add extra fire-retardant chemicals
 to their fabrics (in addition to those specified in current regulations), but these extra
 measures are not required. The process is very expensive, and no other manufacturers
 currently use it. Internal documents show that the management of Novel Clothing had
 decided that "when it comes to costly safety innovations we will follow our competitors.
 We don't want to be less safe than anyone else but we don't have to lead the way either."

 Low harm version: Jack Newton, a five year old child, was playing with matches when his

 cotton flannel pajamas caught fire. His hands and arms were badly burned, and required
 regular professional medical treatment for several weeks.

 Joan Glover

 Joan Glover, a six year old child, ingested a large number of pills of Allerfree, a non-
 prescription allergy medicine, and required an extensive hospital stay. The overdose weak-

 ened her respiratory system, which will make her more susceptible to breathing-related
 diseases such as asthma and emphysema for the rest of her life. The Allerfree bottle used
 an inadequately designed child-proof safety cap. The Glovers sued the manufacturer of
 Allerfree, the General Assistance company. The jury (of which you are a member) ordered
 General Assistance to pay the Glovers $200,000 in compensation.

 General Assistance is a large company (with profits of $100-200 million per year) that
 manufactures a variety of non-prescription medicines. A federal regulation requires
 "child-proof" safety caps on all medicine bottles. General Assistance has systematically
 ignored the intent of this regulation by selling tens of thousands of bottles of medicines
 with a child-proof safety cap that was generally effective, but had a failure rate much
 higher than any others in the industry. An internal company document says that "this
 stupid, unnecessary federal regulation is a waste of our money;" it acknowledges the risk
 that Allerfree may be punished for violating the regulation but says, "the federal govern-

 ment has many other things to worry about and probably won't bother us on this" and in
 any case "the punishments for violating the regulation are extremely mild; basically we'd
 be asked to improve the safety caps in the future." An official at the Food and Drug
 Administration had previously warned a vice president of General Assistance that they
 were "on shaky ground" but the company decided not to take any corrective action.

 Low harm version: Joan Glover, a six year old child, ingested a large number of pills of
 Allerfree, a non-prescription allergy medicine. She had to spend several days in a hospital,
 and is now deeply traumatized by pills of any kind. When her parents try to get her to take
 even beneficial medications such as vitamins, aspirin, or cold remedies, she cries uncon-
 trollably and says that she is afraid.

 Martin West

 Martin West, a right-handed disabled veteran who lived in a two story house, was seri-
 ously injured in a fall when the chain broke on his electric lift-chair (a device that allows
 someone to be carried up stairs in a chair that moves up and down an angled track). He
 fell from near the top of the stairs and tumbled awkwardly all the way to the bottom
 landing, damaging his spinal cord in the process. As a result he now has only partial
 control of his right arm, a condition which doctors believe is permanent. He sued the
 manufacturer of the lift-chair, MedTech Products. The jury (of which you are a member)
 ordered MedTech to pay him $200,000 in compensation.

 MedTech Products is a large company (profits of $100-200 million per year) that
 manufactures many types of medical equipment, including wheelchairs, car-lifts, and
 other devices used by the disabled. The lift-chair is a new product for MedTech, and
 instead of producing a new design, company engineers decided to adapt the design of the
 hydraulic lifts for cars already on the market. Unfortunately, there are several unique
 problems in designing a safe and effective lift-chair that are beyond the experience of the
 company's engineers. Product managers said that hiring new engineers with the proper
 expertise was "too expensive, and would take too long" and ordered current engineers to

 "just do the best you can, but be sure you meet our deadline for announcing the product."

 The inexperience of the engineers and the rush to meet the product announcement date led
 to testing procedures that were less rigorous than those required by federal medical
 product regulations.

 Low harm version: Martin West, a left-handed disabled veteran who lived in a two story

 house, was injured in a fall when the chain broke on his electric lift-chair (a device that
 allows someone to be carried up stairs in a chair that moves up and down an angled track).
 He fell from near the bottom of the stairs and tumbled to the bottom landing, injuring his

 spinal cord in the process. His right arm was paralyzed for several weeks, after which
 doctors were able to repair most of the injury, and he was able to regain most of the

 previous range of motion in the arm.

 Janet Windsor

 Janet Windsor, a secretary who works on computer equipment, developed a rare form of
 skin cancer. After a long course of painful chemotherapy, doctors were able to cure the

 cancer, although they cannot be sure that it will not return. She believed that it had been
 caused by the computer monitors that she worked on and sued the manufacturer, Inter-
 national Computers. The jury (of which you are a member) ordered International Com-
 puters to pay her $200,000 in compensation.

 International Computers is a large company (profits of $100-200 million per year) that
 manufactures components of computer systems. The type of International Computers
 monitor that Ms. Windsor used emits an unusually high level of radiation compared to
 other similar monitors, a level that pushes the limit in government safety guidelines.

 Internal company documents cite experts who concluded that "the evidence that this level
 of radiation could create any serious risk to health and life is weak and tentative." The
 company was not legally required to disclose the unusual level of radiation, and it did not
 do so.

 Low harm version: Janet Windsor, a secretary who works on computer equipment, suf-

 fered from frequent and severe migraine headaches. As a result, for several years she often
 experienced nausea, insomnia and depression, and missed many workdays and family
 events.

 Notes

 1 . Except for cases at the extremes of the scale, where all respondents agree.

 2. a3 is based on the ratio of the third to the second moments of the distribution, and is obtained by calculating

 a z-score (i.e., substract the sample mean and divide by the sample standard deviation) for each observation,

 cubing it, and then computing the average of these cubed z-scores. A positive value means the distribution

 is skewed to the right, a negative statistic means it is skewed to the left, and zero means it is symmetric.

 3. Davis and his colleagues have developed a model called the Social Judgment Scheme (SJS) that may hold
 promise for improving on the median, but there is as yet no clear evidence for this claim. For example, in

 Davis (1996) the SJS was slightly better than the median at predicting the responses of individual juries but

 slightly worse at predicing the overall distribution of awards.

 4. On the extent to which actual punitive damage awards are unpredictable, compare Eisenberg (1997) with

 Polinsky (1997).

 5. The observation that a context of comparable cases improves the signal/noise ratio of judgments suggests

 that ranking could be more useful than rating; see section 3.1.1.

 6. The design and some of the analysis of the present study were patterned after an earlier study of willingness

 to pay for public goods (Kahneman and Ritov, 1994).
