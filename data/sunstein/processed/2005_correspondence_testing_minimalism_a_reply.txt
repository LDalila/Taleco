TESTING MINIMALISM:  A  REPLY

Cass R.  Sunstein *

Some judges  are  less  ambitious  than  others;  they  have  minimalist  ten-
dencies. Minimalists  are  unambitious  along two  dimensions.  First, they  seek
to  rule  narrowly  rather  than  broadly.  In  a  single  case,  they  do  not wish  to
resolve  other, related  problems  that  might  have  relevant  differences.  They
are  willing to live with  the costs  and burdens  of uncertainty,  which they tend
to  prefer  to  the  risks  of  premature  resolution  of difficult  issues.  Second,
minimalists  seek  to  rule  shallowly  rather  than deeply,  in  the sense  that they
favor  arguments  that  do  not  take  a  stand  on  the  foundational  debates  in law
and politics. They prefer incompletely  theorized  agreements,  by which  diverse
people,  from  their different perspectives,  can unite  behind  modest  rather than
immodest theorizing.  They believe  that  such  agreements  recognize  the diffi-
culty  of  resolving  foundational  debates,  and  that  they  also  allow  people,
including judges,  to show  one  another a large  measure  of mutual  respect.

In  prominent  cases,  some judges  favor minimalism,  and  others  do  not.
Justice  O'Connor,  for  example,  has often  shown  a preference  for case-by-
case  judgments  that  leave  the  most  difficult  questions  for  another  day.3
Justice  Scalia,  by  contrast,  is  no  minimalist.4  He  endorses  an  ambitious
theory  of constitutionalism-"originalism"-and  he often  uses  that  theory
to  decide  cases.5  Much  of the  time,  he  prefers  to  rule  broadly  rather  than
narrowly,  because  of his  preference  for  rule-bound  judgments  that  give
clear  guidance  for  the  future.  Of  course  minimalism  and  maximalism
should  be  seen  as  relative  rather  than  absolute.  Justice  O'Connor  is  a
minimalist,  much  of the time,  but  she does  not always  follow a  minimalist
path,  and even when  she  does,  she  does  not  say  that her rulings  are limited
to  people  with  the  same  initials  as  the  parties  to  the  particular  litigation.

The pragmatic  judge  tends to  favor  narrow over  broad  grounds of decision  in the  early  stages
in the  development  of a  legal  doctrine....  What  the judge  has before  him is  the  facts  of the
particular case,  not  the  facts  of future cases.  He  can  try  to  imagine  what  those cases  will  be
like, but  the likelihood  of error in  such  an imaginative projection  is great. Working outward,  in
stages, from the  facts before him to future  cases with  new  facts that may  suggest the desirabil-
ity of altering  the  contours  of the  applicable  rules,  the judge  avoids  premature  generalization

Justice  Scalia  has  maximalist  tendencies,  but  he  does  not  try,  in  a  single
equal  protection  case,  to  resolve all  imaginable  equal protection  cases.

I  am  extremely  grateful  to  Neil  Siegel  for  his  generous  and  careful
analysis  of  my  claims  about  minimalism  and  the  Supreme  Court.6  Siegel
offers  three objections  to  those  claims.7  First,  he  contends  that  minimalism
has  not  been  precisely  defined,  and that  the  presence  of diverse  and  incon-
sistent  definitions  makes  it  difficult  to  test  the  claim  that  any  particular
court,  or any  particular  decision,  is  minimalist in  character.  Second,  Siegel
claims  that  the  most usable  definition  of  minimalism  is  palpably  inconsis-
tent  with  Court's  behavior  during 
the  2003  term  (and  probably  more
generally).  Third, he contends  that minimalism, suitably  defined, is unattrac-
tive,  among  other  things  because  it  violates  the  Supreme  Court's  roles  as
guide  and  as  guardian.  These  are  instructive  objections.  But  the  disagree-
ment  between  Siegel and  me is  smaller  (more minimal!)  than it appears,  and
I  hope  that  a  few  clarifying  remarks  will  help to  illuminate  both  the nature
and the  uses of the minimalist  project.

1.  MINIMALISMS

What  is  minimalism?  Let  us  begin  with  three  distinctions.  First, proce-
dural minimalism entails  an effort to limit the  scope  and  ambition of judicial
rulings;  procedural  minimalism  should  be  distinguished  from  what  I  call
minimalism's substance,  which  entails  an  identifiable  set  of  substantive
commitments  (to, for example,  fair procedures  and the rule of law).'  Second,
procedural  minimalism  as  a  general  category  should  be  distinguished  from
the  subcategory  of democracy-forcing minimalism, which  involves  an  effort
to issue  narrow  rulings  that do not mandate  ultimate outcomes  but  that force
decisions  by politically  accountable  actors.9 The  Court  might,  for example,
refuse  to  resolve  a  hard constitutional  problem  and rule  more  narrowly  that
Congress  must  authorize  an  intrusion  on  constitutionally  sensitive  inter-
ests.'0  Third,  denials  of certiorari  and justiciability  doctrines,  by  which  the
Court  refuses  to  reach  the  merits,  should be  distinguished  from  narrow  and
incompletely  theorized  judgments,  by which  the  Court  resolves  the  merits

Testing Minimalism: A  Reply

but without  much  foreclosing  the future."  When  the  Court denies  certiorari,
or holds  that  a  decision  is  unreviewable,  it  is  adopting  a  form of procedural
minimalism,  but  that  form  is  importantly  different  from  narrow  and  incom-
pletely  theorized judgments.  I hope that  I  made  these distinctions  adequately
in earlier  writings,  but very  possibly  not;  Siegel  is  certainly  correct  to insist
on  their importance.

Siegel's  principal  concern,  and  mine  as  well,  is  procedural  minimalism
in  the  form  of narrow  and  incompletely  theorized  rulings.  Quoting  from  a
2004  op-ed  of  mine,  Siegel  suggests  that  procedural  minimalism  requires
courts  to  decide  "the  largest  issues of the day  ...  as  narrowly  as  possible.' 2
Hence  he  offers  a  testable  hypothesis,  to  the  effect  that  a  decision  is  mini-
malist  if it involves  an  "intentional  choice  by  a  majority  of the  Justices  ...
to decide  a case on the  narrowest  and shallowest  grounds  reasonably  open to
them,  even  though  broader  and  deeper  rationale(s)  were  reasonably  avail-
able.""

Siegel should  certainly be  commended for offering  a testable  hypothesis,
as  I did  not. He is  right to  say that there  is  a great deal  of room  for empirical
work on  the Supreme  Court's uses of minimalism.  But I  never meant to sug-
gest  that  members  of the  Court  pursue  minimalism  with  the  intensity  and
rigor suggested by  Siegel's hypothesis.  To be sure,  it is  possible to imagine  a
set  of judges,  or perhaps  even  a court,  taking  the  trouble to  identify  the pos-
sible  rationales  for certain  decisions  and consistently  selecting  the  narrowest
and  less  ambitious  of these.  But  no  real-world  court  is  likely  to  act  in  this
way;  and for  reasons  that  Siegel  identifies,  such a  court  would be nothing  to
celebrate,  if only  because  it  would  give  so  little  guidance  for  the  future.  A
court of this kind  would  turn  minimalism  into  a kind  of dogma  or  theology.
It  would not  use minimalism  on  the  intensely  pragmatic  grounds  that  some-
times  support  it.

When  I  suggest  that  the  current  Supreme  Court  (often)  favors  proce-
dural  minimalism,  then,  I  mean  to  say  only  that  in  the  most  difficult  and
controversial  domains,  the  Court  tends  to  choose  relatively  narrow  and
unambitious  grounds."  The  Court  has  not  accepted  a  large-scale  theory
of  constitutional  interpretation;  it  proceeds  by  building  cautiously  on
precedent,  in  the  fashion  of  common 
law  courts.  Unfortunately,  my
claim-that  minimalists  prefer  relatively  narrow  and  unambitious

See  SUNSTEIN,  ONE  CASE  AT  A  TIME,  supra note  7,  at  46-60.  Note,  in  the  spirit  of
Siegel's  critique, that  a decision  that  is both  wide  and  deep  might  also leave  many issues  undecided.
Consider,  for example,  a  decision  to  the  effect  that  people have  a  constitutional  right,  on  autonomy
grounds,  to  avoid  "undue  burdens"  on  their  medical  choices.  Courts  that  leave  things  undecided
after  broad and  ambitious  rulings should not  be  treated as  minimalist.

Siegel  identifies  this  possibility.  Siegel,  supra note  6,  at  2016.  He  adds  that  the  sugges-
tion  that  the  Court  favors  "relatively narrow  and  shallow  holdings"  is  "less  clearly  inaccurate,"  and
notes  that this  claim could  be  tested  empirically. Id. at  2019. I agree.

grounds-is  not  entirely  easy  to  test  empirically.  To  test  that  claim,  it
would  be  necessary  to  identify  a  large  number  of  cases,  to  specify  the
possible  grounds  for  decision,  and  to  see  how  often  the  Court  selected
narrower  grounds  in the  face  of competing  possibilities.  It  would  also be
necessary  to  specify  what  counts  as  minimalism  along  all  relevant  di-
mensions,  and  to  decide  how  to  count  a  decision  in  which  minimalism
along  one  dimension  (say,  avoiding  the  merits)  produces  maximalism
along  another  dimension  (say,  through  a  wide  ruling  on  standing).  A
great  deal  of coding  would  be  necessary  by  people  with  internal  under-
standing  of the  relevant  cases.  Notwithstanding  the  difficulties,  there  is  a
great deal  of room  for  empirical  testing  of minimalism. In  the  absence  of
empirical  work,  I  can  suggest  only  that  in  many  of the  most  prominent
cases  in recent  years,  the  Court has  rejected  both width  and  depth.  Siegel
himself  offers a  number  of examples. 16

II. MINIMALisM  FALSIFIED?

As  I  have  said,  Siegel  understands  minimalism  in  absolute  rather
than relative  terms,  as  involving  an intentional  decision  "to  decide  a case
on the  narrowest  and  shallowest  grounds  reasonably open  to"  the  Court. 7
He  explores  a  number  of  decisions  from  the  October  2003  term  to  see
whether  the Court  was minimalist  in  that  sense.  He  finds  that  if this  is  the
right  account of minimalism, the  Court has not consistently  followed it.

Consider  a  few  examples.  In  Blakely  v.  Washington,"  the  Court  did
refuse  to  decide  the  validity  of  the  Federal  Sentencing  Guidelines,  but
that  should  be  unsurprising;  what  matters  is  that  the  Court  could  have
ruled  on the  Sixth Amendment  question  in  a way  that was  more  narrowly
limited  to  the  facts.  In  McConnell v.  Federal Election Commission,'9 the
Court  left many  issues  undecided  and  generally  avoided  width,  but it did
not  rule  on  the  narrowest  possible  grounds,  especially  in  its  expansive
understanding  of "corruption"  in  politics.2  Siegel  agrees  that  the  Court
pursued  a  fairly  minimalist  path  in  Locke  v.  Davey2'  and  Tennessee  v.
Lane,22  though  more  in  the  latter  case  than  in  the  former.23  But  he  does
not  find  minimalism  in  two  of  the  Court's  most  eagerly  awaited  deci-
sions,  Elk  Grove  Unified  School  District v.  Newdow  and  Rumsfeld  v.

Testing Minimalism: A Reply

Padilla.25  He  acknowledges  that Newdow,  refusing to  resolve  the constitu-
tionality  of the  Pledge  of Allegiance,  was  in  a  sense  minimalist,26 but  he
thinks  that  Padilla, involving  a  merits-avoiding  procedural  ground,  an-
nounced  a  broad  (procedural)  rule  with  large  implications  for  other
issues.27

In  a  series  of instructive  discussions,  Siegel  convincingly  shows  that,  in
a  number  of cases  in the  2003  term,  the  Court did  not  rule  in  the narrowest
imaginable  way.  But is  that big  news?  Let us  identify  a  continuum  of possi-
ble outcomes,  from  a  denial  of certiorari,  to a  refusal  to reach  the merits,  to
a  fact-bound  decision  that  goes  barely  beyond  the  immediate  parties,  to  a
decision that  states  an  identifiable  if narrow  rule  with  an  identifiable  if shal-
low  rationale, to  a  decision  that offers  an  identifiable  but broad  rule,  and  so
on,  culminating  in  a  truly  maximalist  (if  also  unfathomable)  decision  that
resolves  all  questions  for  all  time  by  reference  to  the  most  fundamental  of
principles.  Focusing  on  the  2003  term,  Siegel  makes  a  special  target  of my
2004 op-ed,  which, to  be sure,  does  not analyze  minimalism  in much  detail.
But  the  essential  claims  in  that  little  op-ed  may nonetheless  hold.  In  New-
dow,  the Court  did  refuse to  assess  the  Pledge  of Allegiance  on  the  merits.
In Padilla, the Court did refuse  to rule on the  merits  of an exceptionally  con-
troversial  issue  of  presidential  authority;  the  same  is  true  of  the  Cheney

ants, 3ยฐ  the  Court  did  say  more  than  was  strictly  speaking  "necessary,"  but  it
also  showed  a  tendency  toward  both  narrowness  and  shallowness  insofar  as
it  deliberately  refused  to  resolve  some  of  the  key  questions  raised  by  the
litigants.3'

2

Siegel's  most  interesting  point, it  seems to  me,  is  that a  decision  that is
minimalist  along  one  dimension may be  wide or deep on another.  If a  court
invokes  a  procedural  ground  to  avoid  the  merits,  that  very  ground  might be
ambitiously  reasoned  or  apply  to  a  wide  range  of problems  not  before  the
Court.  Siegel  is  right to  emphasize  this  possibility. He  is  also right  to  iden-
tify many  ways during the  2003  term in which  the Court failed  to choose  the
narrowest  possible  rationale  for  its  decision.  But  I  wonder  if that  is  the  ap-
propriate  test  of  the  minimalist  hypothesis.  Notwithstanding  a  regrettably
loose  phrase  in an  op-ed  ("as  narrowly  as  possible"),  those  who  find strong
minimalist  tendencies  in the Supreme  Court are  inclined  to think that Siegel
may have  mounted an  attack, illuminating to be sure,  on a  strawman.

Is MINIMALIsM  BAD?

Siegel  dislikes  minimalism;  he  believes  that  it  is  normatively  unattrac-
tive,  because  it  leaves  so  much  uncertainty.  He  emphasizes  that  "often  it  is
critical  that  the  Court  provide  guidance,  either  to  the  lower  courts  or  to  the
political  process. '3 2  Objecting  to  the  uncertainty  introduced  by  Rasul  v.
Bush,33  Newdow,34  and Lane,35  he  thinks  that the Court  should try  to provide
clear  rules  for  others,  so  as  to  reduce  aggregate  decision  costs.  Siegel  fears
that  minimalist  decisions  often  leave  important  problems  to  lower  courts,
not to citizens  and their representatives,  and  to  that extent  such  decisions  do
not  promote  democratic  goals.  He  believes  that  the  Supreme  Court  is  a
guardian  as  well  as  a  guide,  and he insists  that it  is  appropriate  for constitu-
tional  theory  to  specify  the  areas  in  which  ambitious  rulings  are  justified,
even when those  rulings reject  the outcomes  of political  processes.

36

I  am  not  sure  how  much  Siegel  and  I  disagree  on  the  normative  ques-
tions.  I  have  not  argued,  and  I  do not  believe,  that  minimalism  is  generally
or  always  the  right  path.  When  planning  is  important,  minimalism  is  haz-
ardous;  when  minimalism  imposes  high  decisional  burdens  on  others,  the
argument  for  minimalism  is  weakened.  Hence  minimalism  must  be  evalu-
ated  in  terms  that  have  become  familiar  from  the  rules-standards  debate  in
many  domains  of  the law.37  If it  is  desirable  for the  Supreme  Court to  leave
decisions  to  lower courts,  it  is  partly  because  lower  court  decisions  are  less
final,  and  a  degree  of percolation  can  occur  there  at the  same  time  that  de-
liberative  debate  takes  place  within  the  citizenry  as  a  whole.  In  the  end
Siegel and  I  agree  that the  argument  for  minimalism  is  strongest in  an  iden-
tifiable  class  of cases:  those  in  which American  society  is  morally  divided,
those  in  which  the  Court  is  not confident  that  it knows  the  right answer,  and
those  in  which  the  citizenry  is  likely  to  profit  from  more  sustained  debate
and reflection.

If  Siegel  and  I  have  a  normative  disagreement,  it  is  because  he  is  more
confident  than  I  am  about  what  he  calls  "the  Supreme  Court's  role-and
comparative  advantage-in  our constitutional  system  of  separate  but  interre-
lated  powers."3 9  Invoking  Brown  v.  Board of  Education,4ยฐ  which  he  labels
"heroic, 4'  he emphasizes  that  as  compared  to  other  institutions,  "the  Justices

are  more  insulated  from  the  pressures  of majoritarian  politics  and  therefore
better  equipped  to  protect  minority  rights. 42  This  is  of  course  a  plausibleโข  41
and  time-honored  view,  defended  in  whole  or  in  part by  the  early  Bickel,
Dworkin,"  and Ely.45  Certainly  it  is  easy  to  find  cases  in  which  the  Court's
insulation  served  the  nation  well.  But  if we  are  going  to  celebrate  Brown, 6
we  had  better  not  forget  about  Dred Scott v.  Sandford7  or  Lochner v. New
York48  or  Coppage v.  Kansas49-- or, for  that  matter,  United States  v.  Morri-
son,  Kimel v.  Florida Board of Regents,5  City of Boerne v.  Flores,2  Board
of Trustees of the  University of Alabama v.  Garrett,53  Adarand Constructors,
Inc. v.  Pena,5 4 and Gratz v. Bollinger." The  Court's  conception  of what prin-
ciple  requires,  and  its  understanding  of  what  it  means  to  defend  "minority
rights,"  should not be taken  as  unerring.  From  the moral  point  of view, insu-
lation  from  majoritarian  pressures  is  sometimes 
the  problem,  not  the
solution.

But  good  minimalists  do  not  mean  to  attack  the structure  of judicial  re-
view.  They  mean  to  insist  instead  on  Learned  Hand's  suggestion,  in  the
midst  of World  War  II,  that  "[tihe  spirit  of liberty  is  that  spirit which  is  not
too  sure  that  it  is  right  .... 
,56  In  many  of its  best  moments,  the  Rehnquist
Court has  respected  that spirit,  not  least in  decisions  involving free  speech, 7
sex  equality, 8  the  war on  terrorism, 9  and even  federalism.6  In  its own  small
way, minimalism can  be  heroic too.
