      <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
      <p>In 1983, Judge Antonin Scalia, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit, published a dramatic and
provocative essay on the law of standing. The thesis can be found in the title:</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>The Doctrineof StandingAs An EssentialElement of the Separationof</title>
      <p>Powers.I Only recently named a judge, and having taught
administrative and constitutional law for many years, Judge Scalia called for a
significant shift in the law of standing.</p>
      <p>Judge Scalia's argument hinged on a distinction between two kinds
of cases. "[W]hen an individual who is the very object of a law's
requirement or prohibition seeks to challenge it, he always has
standing."'2 But standing should frequently be unavailable when "the
plaintiff is complaining of an agency's unlawful failure to impose a
requirement or prohibition upon someone else." 3 In the latter case,
Judge Scalia contended that there was a serious interference with
executive power. Judge Scalia concluded that in cases of the latter sort,
courts should hold that Article III imposes "a limit upon even the
power of Congress to convert generalized benefits into legal
rights ....-"4The Court had not addressed this important and
longdisputed issue before.</p>
      <p>In 1992, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the dramatic opinion for the
Supreme Court in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,5 which significantly

Powers, 17 SUFFOLK U. L. REv. 881 (1983).</p>

shifts the law of standing. The opinion hinges on a distinction between
two kinds of cases. "When... the plaintiff is himself an object of the
action (or forgone action) at issue ...
there is ordinarily little
question" that he has standing. 6 "When, however, ... a plaintiff's asserted
injury arises from the government's allegedly unlawful regulation (or
lack of regulation) of someone else, much more is needed."' 7 In the
latter case, there is the risk of serious interference with executive
power, in the form of a "transfer from the President to the courts" of
"the Chief Executive's most important constitutional duty, to 'take
Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.' "8' Through Justice Scalia's
opinion, the Court held that Article III required invalidation of an
explicit congressional grant of standing to "citizens." 9 The Court had
not answered this question before.10</p>
      <p>Lujan may well be one of the most important standing cases since
World War II. Read for all it is worth, the decision invalidates the
large number of statutes in which Congress has attempted to use the
"citizen-suit" device as a mechanism for controlling unlawfully
inadequate enforcement of the law.' Indeed, the decision ranks among the
most important in history in terms of the sheer number of federal
statutes that it apparently has invalidated.12 The citizen suit has become a
staple of federal environmental law in particular: nearly every major
environmental statute provides for citizen standing.13 The place of the

citizen standing was constitutional even without a showing of injury in fact. See, eg., Evans v.

      <p>13. See supra note 11.
citizen in environmental and regulatory law has now been drawn into
sharp question.</p>
      <p>But the importance of Lujan does not lie only in the invalidation of
the citizen suit. The decision revises the law of standing in several
other ways as well. And it raises a host of new puzzles for later cases
to solve.</p>
      <p>In this article, I have two principal goals. The first is to explain
why Lujan's invalidation of a congressional grant of standing is a
misinterpretation of the Constitution. It is now apparently the law that
Article III forbids Congress from granting standing to "citizens" to
bring suit. But this view, building on an unfortunate innovation in
standing law by Justice William 0. Douglas,14 is surprisingly novel. It
has no support in the text or history of Article III. It is essentially an
invention of federal judges, and recent ones at that.</p>
      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>Certainly it</title>
        <p>should not be accepted by judges who are sincerely committed to the
original understanding of the Constitution and to judicial restraint.
Nor should it be accepted by judges who have different approaches to
constitutional interpretation.</p>
        <p>Lujan holds that the requirement of an "injury in fact" is a
limitation on congressional power; but an "injury in fact," as the Court
understands it, is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for
standing. The relevant question is instead whether the law
governing statutes, the Constitution, or federal common law
has
conferred on the plaintiffs a cause of action. 15</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-2">
        <title>An inquiry into "injury in</title>
        <p>fact" will both allow standing where it should be denied and deny
standing where it should be granted.</p>
        <p>More fundamentally, the very notion of "injury in fact" is not
merely a misinterpretation of the Administrative Procedure Act 16 and
Article III but also a large-scale conceptual mistake. I hope to show
that the injury-in-fact requirement should be counted as a prominent
contemporary version of early twentieth-century substantive due
process. It uses highly contestable ideas about political theory to
invalidate congressional enactments, even though the relevant constitutional
text and history do not call for invalidation at all. Just like its early
twentieth-century predecessor, it injects common law conceptions of
harm into the Constitution. Moreover, it acts as if injury can be
assessed through a purely factual inquiry, rather than one that is
inevitably a product of courts' value-laden judgments and of governing legal
conventions. This deep problem has been obscured by the surprising
evolution of modem standing principles.</p>
        <p>My second goal is to discuss the many new issues that will arise in
the aftermath of Lujan. Under what circumstances can citizens now
prove that they are not mere citizens, but people with the requisite
"injury" or "personal stake"? How does Lujan affect environmental
and other regulatory cases? What might Congress do to respond to
the decision? These will be the key questions in the next decade. They
will have considerable importance for the development of
environmental law and risk regulation, and indeed for administrative and
regulatory law in general.</p>
        <p>This article is divided into three Parts. Part I briefly sets out the
history of the law of standing. Here I discuss the clear acceptance of
"stranger" or "citizen" suits at the founding period in both England
and early America. The Lujan Court should not have taken the
extraordinary step of invalidating a congressional grant of standing
without investigating the relevant history.</p>
        <p>I also describe the very recent creation of the "injury-in-fact" test.
I will show that, in an exceedingly short period, a revisionist view of
Article III, with no textual or historical support, has established injury
in fact as a constitutional prerequisite. I also argue that, despite its
apparent simplicity, the notion of injury in fact is heavily dependent
on an assessment of law and is far from a law-free inquiry into facts.</p>
        <p>Part II describes and evaluates the various holdings in the Lujan
question of substantive law, answerable by reference to the statutory and constitutional provision
whose protection is invoked." 111 S. CL at 1704 (citing Fletcher, supra, at 229).

case. I end the Part with two brief detours: a discussion of the role of
the citizen suit in regulatory law and a general assessment of Justice
Scalia's conception of Article III, as set out in his 1983 Suffolk Law
Review article. The overlap between the 1992 Lujan opinion and the
1983 article is sharp and clear. The overlap makes the article a matter
of considerable current interest.</p>
        <p>Part III discusses the future of the law of standing in the wake of
Lujan. Here I try to show exactly which issues are open and which
closed. One of my major purposes is to explore the effect of Lujan on
current regulatory cases brought by beneficiaries. of regulatory
statutes. I argue that in many such cases standing remains available, but
that some cases brought by consumers and others are now drawn into
sharp question.</p>
        <p>In order to overcome some of the uncertainties now facing citizen
suits, I recommend that Congress create a system of bounties for
citizens in cases involving both private defendants and the executive
branch. Even after Lujan, such a system should raise no
constitutional question. Congress may also have the power both to create
property rights in the benefits provided by regulatory statutes and to
establish standing to vindicate those property rights. I conclude with
a discussion of this intriguing possibility.</p>
        <p>I.</p>
        <p>A CAPSULE HISTORY OF STANDING</p>
        <p>
          The law of standing has had many remarkable twists and turns.
For convenience, we might think of American law as evolving through
five different eras of standing doctrine. We are now in the midst of the
fifth; its contours remain indistinct. But one of its principal features is
an insistence that Article III requires injury in fact, causation, and
redressability - requirements
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">unknown to our law until the 1970</xref>
          s. In
this Part, I outline the development of standing doctrine. 17
        </p>
        <p>It makes sense to begin with the text of Article III, which extends
"Judicial Power" to certain specified "Cases" and "Controversies." 18
In the original understanding, "cases" included both civil and criminal
disputes, whereas "controversies" were limited to civil disputes. 19
Article III contains no explicit constitutional requirement of "standing"
or "personal stake." Nor does it ever refer to "injury in fact." It does
require a case or controversy, and very plausibly there is no such thing
17. Some aspects of this history are also discussed in Sunstein, supra note 15.

without a cause of action. 20 If we are to impose additional standing
requirements, we must do so on the basis not of text but of history,
both before and at the time of the framing and through judicial
practice over time.2 1</p>
        <p>An overview of opinions addressing the issue of standing will help
illustrate the basic picture. In the history of the Supreme Court,
standing has been discussed in terms of Article III on 117 occasions. 22
Of those 117 occasions, 55, or nearly half, of the discussions occurred
after 1985</p>
        <p>that is, in the past seven years. Of those 117, 71, or over
two thirds, of the discussions occurred after 1980
that is, in just
over a decade. Of those 117, 109, or nearly all, of the discussions
occurred since 1965. The first reference to "standing" as an Article III
limitation can be found in Stark v. Wickard,2 3 decided in 1944. The
next reference does not appear until eight years later, in Adler v. Board
of Education.24 Not until the Data Processing case in 197025 did a
large number of cases emerge on the issue of standing. The explosion
of judicial interest in standing as a distinct body of constitutional law
26
is an extraordinarily recent phenomenon.</p>

26. This evidence is crude because it is consistent with two speculations. (a) Perhaps the
recency of the particular words obscures the tradition represented by the general concept. (b)
Perhaps standing has become important only recently as a result of attempts to bring suit by
people who would never even thought of doing so before. If (a) is true, the evidence tells us
nothing. If (b) is true, the constitutional limit was always present but did not have to be often
invoked until recently.</p>
        <p>The discussion in Part I should shed light on these possibilities. For the moment, a few brief
words. The history suggests that (a) is only partly true. A cause of action has traditionally been
required, and this requirement is indeed imposed by Article III. But standing, as a distinct body
of law, represents a genuinely new development, not a traditional one. As Part I also suggests,
(b) is only partly true as well. Stranger or citizen actions are familiar to English and American
law. The suit to compel nondiscretionary government action is no innovation; it is part of the old
idea of mandamus. On the other hand, the modem regulatory state has furnished many more
occasions for this suit than was traditional.</p>

injury-in-fact test played no role in administrative and constitutional
law until the past quarter century.</p>
        <p>To say this is not to deny that there were important antecedents
for the requirement of standing. As we will soon see, there had always
been a question whether the plaintiff had a cause of action, and this
was indeed a matter having constitutional status. Without a cause of
action, there was no case or controversy and hence no standing. This
is an extremely important principle. Moreover, a handful of cases in
the 1920s and 1930s relied on notions of "standing" without
mentioning the word. These cases, too, are of considerable importance. But
we will see that the modem understanding of standing is insufficiently
self-conscious of its own novelty, even of its revisionism.</p>
        <p>A.</p>
        <sec id="sec-3-5-1">
          <title>English and American Practice</title>
          <p>The first period, by far the longest, ranges from the founding era to
roughly 1920. In that period, there was no separate standing doctrine
at all.29 No one believed that the Constitution limited Congress'
power to confer a cause of action. Instead, what we now consider to
be the question of standing was answered by deciding whether
Congress or any other source of law had granted the plaintiff a right to
sue. 30 To have standing, a litigant needed a legal right to bring suit.</p>
          <p>The notion of injury in fact did not appear in this period. The
existence of a concrete, personal interest, or an injury in fact, was
neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for a legal proceeding.
People with a concrete interest could not bring suit unless the common
law, or some other source of law, said so. But if a source of law
conferred a right to sue, "standing" existed, entirely independently of
"concrete interest" or "injury in fact."' 31</p>
          <p>Implicit in these ideas was a particular conception of Article III
and a particular understanding of the relationship between Article III
and standing. If neither Congress nor the common law had conferred
a right to sue, no case or controversy existed. Whatever harm had
occurred was not legally cognizable at all; this was a case of damnum
29. Much of the relevant history emerges from three important essays: Raoul Berger,
Standing toSue in PublicActions: Is It a ConstitutionalRequirement?,78 YALE L.J. 816 (1969); Louis
L. Jaffe, Standing to Secure JudicialReview: PublicAction. 74 HARV. L. REv. 1265, 1269-82
(1961); Winter, supra note 22, at 1394-425. I rely a good deal on these treatments here.</p>
          <p>30. See Winter, supra note 22, at 1395-96 (explaining how this idea was mediated through
the forms of action); supra note 15. Justice Scalia appears to have recognized this point, subject
to his Article III caveats, in his 1983 article: "Standing requires ... the allegation of some
particularized injury to the individual plaintiff. But legal injury is by definition no more than the
violation of a legal right; and legal rights can be created by the legislature." Scalia, supranote 1,
at 885.</p>
          <p>31. See Winter, supra note 22, at 1396.
absque injuria. Courts had no power to hear the plaintiff's claim.
There was therefore a sharp distinction between an injury on the one
hand (a "harm") and a legal injury on the other. To this extent, the
Article III requirement of a case or controversy did indeed constrain
the category of persons who could bring suit. But the constraint had
everything to do with whether the legislature or some other source of
law had created a cause of action. It had nothing to do with "injury in
fact."</p>
          <p>There is no evidence of constitutional limits on the power to grant
standing. In both England and America, actions by strangers, or by
citizens in general, were fully permissible and indeed familiar. There
is no basis for the view that the English and early American
conception of adjudication forbade suits by strangers or citizens.</p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>1. England</title>
      <p>The practice in England is revealing, for it helps cast light on what
the founding generation may have understood by "case or
controversy." Before and at the time of the framing, the English practice
was to allow strangers to have standing in the many cases involving
the ancient prerogative writs. Of these writs, two of the most
important were certiorari and prohibition. "The English tradition of locus
standi in prohibition and certiorari is that 'a stranger' has standing,
but relief in suits by strangers is discretionary." 3' 2</p>
      <p>The governing idea behind the writ of prohibition was that a
usurpation of jurisdiction encroached on the royal prerogative. It followed
that anyone could bring the writ.33 A key case was Articuloi Cler,
reported by Coke in a passage that would have been familiar to the
Americans of the late eighteenth century.3 4 The central passage says:
"And the kings courts that may award prohibitions, being informed
either by the parties themselves, or by any stranger, that any court
temporall or eclesiasticall doth hold plea of that (whereof they have
not jurisdiction) may lawfully prohibit the same ... ,,a3 No English
court appears to have rejected the view that prohibition was available
at the behest of strangers.3 6</p>
      <p>The writ of certiorari was similarly available to citizens, and not
just those with a concrete or personal interest. A case in 1724

cated that "one who comes merely as a stranger" was entitled to
discretionary judicial relief.37 Suits by strangers were also permitted
under a statute allowing an information of quo warranto.38 An
English case expressly so held in the auspicious year of 1789.39</p>
      <p>There were other English precedents for the citizen suit. In the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, mandamus was available in
England, even at the behest of strangers. 40 Thus Berger writes:
From such cases a colonial lawyer might well have concluded that
mandamus was capable of issuance at the suit of a stranger who sought to
assert the public interest, especially because the analogy of mandamus to
prohibition was early drawn, and because Coke, who had unequivocally
stated the availability of prohibition to strangers, also made a massive
assertion of mandamus jurisdiction. 4 1
The mandamus action is closely related to the modem citizen suit.
The purpose of the mandamus action is to require the executive
branch to do what the law requires it to do. This is the same idea that
underlies the citizen suit, most conspicuously in the environmental

      <p>Related devices in England were the informers' action and the
relator action. In the informers' action, cash bounties were awarded to
strangers who successfully prosecuted illegal conduct. In relator
actions, suits would be brought formally in the name of the Attorney
General, but at the instance of a private person, often a stranger.

century, attempted to draw on the Westminster practice.45 But

suggestion that "the public action - an action brought by a private
person primarily to vindicate the public interest in the enforcement of
public obligations - has long been a feature of our English and
American law."'52</p>
        <p>At the national level, there is no clear American tradition of
reliance on the prerogative writs. According to the Supreme Court's
interpretation of the All Writs Act, 53 Congress did not choose explicitly
to create general mandamus, prohibition, or certiorari jurisdiction,
though there were particular statutory and common law cases
involving the writs, and it seems clear that their limited use was a matter of
legislative discretion rather than constitutional command. 54 There
are, however, revealing early precedents for the citizen suit at the
national level. The writ of prohibition to restrain an allegedly
unconstitutional tax was treated as a constitutional case in a relatively early
decision of the Marshall Court, 55 and in 1875 the Supreme Court
allowed a petition for mandamus at the behest of what it treated as
citizens. In Union Pacific Railroad v. Hall,56 merchants brought suit to
require a federally chartered railroad to create a certain railroad line.
They invoked a general mandamus statute "to compel the Union
Pacific Railroad Company to operate its road as required by law."'57 The
Court said that the merchants were attempting to enforce "a duty to
the public generally" and that they "had no interest other than such as
belonged to others."' 58 Nonetheless, the Supreme Court allowed the
action to go forward.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the early Congress was active as well. I believe that
Congress supplied two precedents - the qui tam action and the
informers' action - that operate as a powerful affirmative argument
against the view that Article III bars "stranger" or "citizen" actions
once these have been congressionally authorized.</p>
        <p>The most important development was the widespread early
congressional creation of the qui tam action. The purpose of this action is
to give citizens a right to bring civil suits to help in the enforcement of
the federal criminal law. Under the qui tam action, a citizen - who
might well be a stranger - is permitted to bring suits against offenders
of the law. Qui tam actions are familiar to American law. "Statutes
providing for actions by a common informer, who himself has no
interest whatever in the controversy other than that given by statute,
have been in existence for hundreds of years in England, and in this
country ever since the foundation of our Government." 59 In the first
decade of the nation's existence, Congress created a number of qui tam
actions. 6° Explicit qui tam provisions were allowed under many
statutes, including those criminalizing the import of liquor without paying
duties, 6 1 prohibiting certain trade with Indian tribes, 62 criminalizing
failure to comply with certain postal requirements, 63 and criminalizing
slave trade with foreign nations."</p>
        <p>The qui tam action was accompanied by the informers' action.
Through this action, people can bring suit to enforce public duties;
successful plaintiffs keep a share of the resulting damages or fines. In
the states, this action had become familiar in the early stages of
American history. Notably, the informers' action was available against both
private defendants and public officials. 65 Early Congresses created at
least two informers' actions to assist in the enforcement of federal law.
The first of these operated not only against private violators but
against executive officials as well. 66 "Suits by those without personal
injury who were acting as representatives of others were not viewed as
raising constitutional problems under article III.1167</p>
        <p>For present purposes, what is especially revealing is that there is
no evidence that anyone at the time of the framing believed that a qui
tam action or informers' action produced a constitutional doubt. No
one thought to suggest that the "case or controversy" requirement
placed serious constraints on what was, in essence, a citizen suit. This
fact provides extremely powerful evidence that Article III did not
impose constraints on Congress' power to grant standing to strangers.</p>
        <p>There are two possible differences between the qui tam and
informers' actions on the one hand and the modem citizen suit on the other.
First, the former are usually brought against a private defendant. By
contrast, the government is often the defendant in the citizen suit, as
indeed it was in Lujan itself. If the requirement of injury is to be read
in light of constitutional provisions relating to executive power,68 then
the existence of the qui tam and informers' actions may not be decisive
as against the claim that citizen or stranger suits are constitutionally
forbidden.</p>
        <p>Second, the victor in a qui tam action is ordinarily entitled to
recover money to be paid to himself, to the United States, or to both.
The victor in an informers' action also receives some financial benefit.
By contrast, the victor in a citizen action does not recover money. For
this reason it is not completely odd to think that, as originally
understood, the Constitution permitted stranger actions only if dollars were
to change hands.</p>
        <p>These are not entirely implausible distinctions. But if they are set
out as part of an argument that Article III forbids the citizen suit, they
do make for quite a stretch. Most important, the informers' action
was available against public as well as private defendants at the state
and federal levels. It cannot be distinguished on the ground that it
operated only against private defendants. Nor should it matter that
money does not change hands. The history suggests that the bounty is
designed to offer an incentive, not to create an injury where none
existed before. A declaratory judgment or an injunction serves the same
purposes as a victorious suit in a qui tam or informers' action. Indeed,
mandamus suits did not involve money at all, and these too were
accepted during the early period. 69</p>
        <p>More generally, if the stranger suit was thought constitutionally
problematic, in all probability some constitutional concern would have
been voiced about the qui tam action or the informers' action. The
absence of any concern about these actions makes it exceedingly
unlikely that the case or controversy requirement was believed to place

        <p>69. See supra notes 53-58 and accompanying text.
any constraints on Congress' ability to grant causes of action to
strangers. 70</p>
        <p>The Constitution may require courts to impose greater constraints
on standing when the executive is the defendant.71 But if an "injury in
fact" is required by Article III, it should not matter a great deal
whether the defendant is public or private. Hence the qui tam and
informers' actions do seem to be powerful evidence against the claim
that an injury in fact is an Article III requirement.</p>

      <title>Summary</title>
      <p>The discussion thus far has shown that early English and
American practices give no support to the view that the Constitution limits
Congress' power to create standing. The relevant practices suggest not
that everyone has standing, nor that Article III allows standing for all
injuries, but instead something far simpler and less exotic: people have
standing if the law has granted them a right to bring suit. There is no
authority to the contrary before the twentieth century, and, indeed, I
think that there is no such authority before World War 11.72</p>
      <p>A general picture emerges from the words of the great
administrative law teacher Frank Goodnow, writing in 1905. Goodnow's
extensive treatise has no discussion of standing, then a foreign concept; but
it does deal with the prerogative writs in America. Describing what
had come to be the American practice, Goodnow wrote:
The purpose of the writs is twofold. In the first place, they are issued
mainly with the intention of protecting private rights; in the second
place, some of them may be made use of also for the purpose of the
maintenance of the law regardless of the fact whether in the particular
case a privaterightis attacked or not Thus in the case of the certiorariit
has been held that this writ may not be made use of simply for the
maintenance of the law, that no one may apply for it unless he has some
particular interest in its issue which is greater than that possessed by the
ordinary citizen. The courts, however, have held with regard to the quo
warranto that it may be issued on the demand of any citizen of
responsibility; and the better rule would seem to be that in matters ofpublic
concern any citizen or taxpayer may apply for the mandamus.73</p>
      <p>In this light, is it even possible to argue that the case or
controversy requirement forbids the citizen action? Perhaps the English
cases are not decisive, since the case-or-controversy requirement was
70. The notion of "stranger" is in fact problematic in this context, for the cause of action
makes the litigant the holder ofa kind of property right. See infra notes 130-32 and
accompanying text.</p>
      <p>71. The point is discussed infra text accompanying notes 145-47.

not present in English law. That requirement might even be seen as a
check on certain suits cognizable in England. Nor is the American
practice completely unambiguous. The prerogative writs were not
generally available at the behest of strangers in the federal courts. As
noted, the qui tam action operated against private persons, and money
would always change hands. It might therefore remain possible to
argue that Article III indeed requires a "personal stake" or an "injury in
fact" because, in the United States, federal courts were not
traditionally given jurisdiction in pure citizen suits.</p>
      <p>The history does not completely foreclose this argument, but it
does make the argument seem far-fetched. There is absolutely no
affirmative evidence that Article III was intended to limit congressional
power to create standing. There is no affirmative evidence of a
requirement of a "personal stake" or an "injury in fact" - beyond the
genuine requirement that some source of law confer a cause of action.
Nor is there reason to believe that the case-or-controversy requirement
was designed to draw sharper limits than existed in English law. The
general unavailability of the prerogative writs in federal court was a
matter of legislative discretion, not constitutional compulsion. 74 It is
at the very least highly suggestive that no one seemed to think that the
qui tam or informers' action raised an Article III issue. In light of all
this, the claim that Article III bars citizen standing - once Congress
has created it - seems most adventurous as a matter of history.</p>
      <p>It would be possible to respond that particular historical
understandings are not always binding in constitutional law. Segregation is
unconstitutional even if the framers did not intend to abolish it;75 in
the Due Process Clause, the meaning of "liberty" changes over time;76
the Contracts Clause has been understood to be far narrower than
originally conceived. 77 Perhaps Article III should be treated the same
way; perhaps we should not be bound by the framers' particular
conception of its meaning.</p>
      <p>The general point about constitutional interpretation seems
correct, but it does not justify the view that Article III prohibits Congress
from granting standing to citizens. When the specific understandings
are not binding, it is because the framers are taken to have set out a
general principle capable of change over time, or because changed
circumstances call for a departure from historically specific

unless some source of law creates a cause of action. It is hard to

      <title>The InitialAppearance of "Standing" The Progressive</title>
      <p>and New Deal Periods</p>
      <p>The second stage of standing law occurred in the early parts of this
century. It was here that "standing" began to make a modest initial
emergence as a discrete body of doctrine. To understand this
development, a little background is in order.</p>
      <p>The preliminary development of standing doctrine should be
understood as part and parcel of the heated struggle, in the 1920s and
1930s, within the country and the courts about the constitutional
legitimacy of the emerging regulatory state. Courts frequently invoked the
Constitution as a barrier to regulatory law.80 Justices Brandeis and
Frankfurter were, in their somewhat different periods, the leading
exponents of the view that courts should defer to the outcomes of
democratic processes.</p>
      <p>In this light, it should come as no surprise that the principal early
architects of what we now consider standing limits were Justices
Brandeis and Frankfurter. 8 '</p>
      <sec id="sec-6-1">
        <title>Their goal was to insulate progressive and</title>
        <p>New</p>
        <p>Deal legislation from frequent judicial attack.</p>
        <p>Attempting to
counter the aggressive Supreme Court of the period, Justices Brandeis
and Frankfurter helped develop a range of devices designed to limit
the occasions for judicial intervention into democratic processes.
78. Brown exemplifies both these points. See Brown, 347 U.S. at 483.</p>
        <p>79. I do not contend that there are no limits to Congress' power to decide what is a "case" or
"controversy." In all likelihood, for example, Congress is barred from overcoming the ban on
advisory opinions. See GEOFFREY R. STONE ET AL., CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 86 (2d ed. 1991).
This ban is a plausible inference from the "Opinions in Writing" Clause, which allows the
President to require opinions from heads of departments, but not from judges. U.S. CONsT. art. II,
§ 2, cl.1. Moreover, the notion of a "case," as historically understood, excludes the judicial
provision of advice at the behest of public officials. Outside of the distinctive area of standing,
then, there are barriers to Congress' power to create a "case" where one did not exist before. In
very rare cases, there may even be barriers to the congressional conferral of standing for
separation-of-powers reasons. Consider, for example, a grant of standing to all members of Congress to
challenge all executive action. I do not deal with such exotic examples here. See also Hayburn's
Case, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 409 (1792) (refusing to adjudicate case where judicial decision is subject to
executive suspension and legislative revision).</p>
        <p>80. See, eg., Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905); see also LAURENCE H. TRIBE,
AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 573-74 n.23-25 (2d ed. 1988) (collecting cases). The
connection between the New Deal and the development of standing doctrine is traced in illuminating
detail in Winter, supra note 22, at 1452-57, and briefly discussed in Sunstein, supra note 15, at
1437-38.</p>
        <p>81. See Winter, supra note 22, at 1443-52.</p>
        <p>In the key cases, they repudiated constitutional attacks on
legislative and administrative action by invoking justiciability doctrines.8 2
Prominent among these doctrines was the requirement of what we
now think of as standing.8 3 The crucial cases involved efforts by
citizens at large to invoke the Constitution to invalidate democratic
outcomes.8 4 In such cases, the Court held that there was no personal
stake for the invocation of judicial power.</p>
        <p>How are we to understand these cases? We might begin by asking
whether there was any source of a cause of action. In each case, no
common law right was at stake. In addition, no statute created a right
to bring suit. Finally, it seemed implausible to suggest, in these cases,
that the relevant constitutional provision created a private right of
action. The very notion that private rights of action - or standing
could be created by constitutional provisions was many years away.8 5
Even if some constitutional provisions created private rights, it seemed
hard to accept the view that provisions in these cases did so, because
the relevant duties could not be individuated and seemed to run to the
public at large. I take up this matter below. 86</p>
        <p>The development of standing limitations in the early part of the
twentieth century was indeed a novelty, in the sense that no separate
body of standing law existed before this period. Notably, the relevant
opinions did not even refer to the word standing. But we might well
see the Brandeis-Frankfurter innovations as broadly compatible with
preexisting law. For the most part, their opinions can be read to hold
that no one has a right to sue unless some law has conferred a right to
do so. In the cases in which the cause of action was denied, no such
right had been conferred. This was the key point in the relevant
opinions. 87</p>
        <p>As noted above, the requirement of a cause of action is indeed a
command both of Article III and of tradition."" The relevant denials
of standing were therefore properly based on the plaintiffs' inability to
find a law that entitled them to sue. Thus the Supreme Court could
write as late as 1939 that, to have standing, a plaintiff must have a
"legal right - one of property, one arising out of contract, one
protected against tortious invasion, or one founded on a statute which
confers a privilege."8 9</p>
        <p>The third period in the development of standing consists of the
enactment and interpretation of the Administrative Procedure Act
(APA) in 1946.90 The relevant provision of the APA was an effort to
codify the developing body of judge-made standing law: "A person
suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or
aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is
entitled to judicial review thereof." 91 This apparently cryptic phrase
was actually designed to recognize standing in three straightforward
categories of cases. All three categories had become well-established
under previous law.92</p>
        <p>First, people could obtain standing by showing that they suffered a
"legal wrong" because a common law interest was at stake. An
invasion of a common law interest would certainly qualify as a legal
wrong. Courts presumed that anyone who could show such an
invasion would be entitled to bring suit. This idea had constitutional
foundations, to the extent that a foreclosure of standing to people with
common law interests might raise problems under the Due Process
Clause or Article III. 93</p>
        <p>Second, plaintiffs could show that they suffered a legal wrong
within the meaning of APA by demonstrating that their statutory
incourts in a democracy, an argument that stems from political theory.
But because that argument is obviously influencing the development of
standing principles in the Supreme Court and elsewhere, it is
worthwhile to address the argument here.</p>
        <sec id="sec-6-1-1">
          <title>Detour L Justice Scalia's Conception of Standing</title>
          <p>In his 1983 essay, Justice Scalia argued that "courts need to accord
greater weight than they have in recent times to the traditional
requirement that the plaintiff's alleged injury be a particularized one,
which sets him apart from the citizenry at large. '235 Scalia
acknowledged that this was "not a linguistically inevitable conclusion." 2 36 The
text of Article III does not suggest that a personal injury is necessary.
But in his key statement, discussed above, Scalia defended the
limitation on grounds of tradition.2 37</p>
          <p>Scalia explicitly claimed that "there is a limit upon even the power
of Congress to convert generalized benefits into legal rights - and
that is the limitation imposed by the so-called 'core' requirement of
standing. ' 238 A central concern is what Scalia describes the recent
rise of the courts as "equal partners" with the legislative and executive
branches. In his view, this unfortunate development is related to the
law of standing. Thus Scalia suggests that "[tihe sine qua non for
emergence of the courts as an equal partner with the executive and
legislative branches in the formulation of public policy was the
assurance of prompt access to the courts by those interested in conducting
the debate. ' 239 Unlimited standing gave people this prompt access,
thus impairing the system of separation of powers in two ways: first,
by providing more occasions for judicial review of executive action;
second, by changing the timing of that review.</p>
          <p>The core of Scalia's argument, however, lies elsewhere.
[Tihe law of standing roughly restricts courts to their traditional
undemocratic role of protecting individuals and minorities against
impositions of the majority, and excludes them from the even more
undemocratic role of prescribing how the other two branches should
function in order to serve the interest of the majority itself.24 °
It is through this lens that Scalia offers the distinction with which I
began this article. In the first class of cases, "an individual who is the

very object of a law's requirement or prohibition seeks to challenge it";
here, standing is simple. In the second class, "the plaintiff is
complaining of an agency's unlawful failure to impose a requirement or
prohibition upon someone else"; here the harm is "a majoritarian
one." 24 1</p>
          <p>The central point in the analysis is that
[u]less the plaintiff can show some respect in which he is harmed more
than the rest of us ... he has not established any basis for concern that
the majority is suppressing or ignoring the rights of a minority that
wants protection, and thus has not established the prerequisite for
judicial intervention. 242
Thus, the "doctrine of standing... is an essential means of restricting
the courts to their assigned role of protecting minority rather than
majority interests. ' 243 Scalia urged that judges had been assigned this
role by the Constitution, and also that the other role - the protection
of majority interests - would be poorly executed by judges.</p>
          <p>After all, judges are removed from political accountability and
selected from a highly educated elite. This situation
is just perfect for a body that is supposed to protect the individual

          <p>Scalia was alert to the concern that, without broad standing for
beneficiaries, legislative enactments would be unlawfully
underenforced within the bureaucracy. Indeed, he noted that statutes might
get "lost or misdirected" in the executive branch; furthermore, he
admitted that this was indeed the consequence of his proposal. 245 But
and this is the article's striking conclusion - this is "a good thing. ' 246
Executive nonimplementation of statutes is part of a well-functioning
democratic process, keeping law current with existing views.
"Yesterday's herald is today's bore." 24 7</p>
          <p>This is a provocative and arresting argument, made in short
compass. But it faces several difficulties. One problem is that the
argument is strikingly ahistorical. The article does not address the
question whether the Framers actually had this conception of Article
III. As we have seen, there is no evidence that they did. There is
considerable evidence to the contrary.</p>
          <p>A second problem is that the approach seems inconsistent with
some of the most prominent aspects of Justice Scalia's own
jurisprudence. Justice Scalia usually insists that judges should read
constitutional provisions at a low level of generality and avoid infusing them
with broad "values" of their own. In his view, such impositions
increase the occasions for judicial invalidation of legislation.2 48 In this
case, however, Scalia reads Article III broadly, invests it with general,
controversial values, and ultimately recommends judicial invalidation
of the outcomes of democratic processes. The theory of "minority
rights" is after all a controversial theory of democracy, counselling
courts to act in some cases but not in others. Let us assume that the
argument is plausible, as it indeed appears to be. Should even a
plausible theory of this kind be invoked in order to invalidate a law that is
not inconsistent with the text and history of the Constitution?</p>
          <p>There is a further problem. In a case of beneficiary or citizen
standing, courts are not enforcing "executive branch adherence to
legislative policies that the political process itself would not enforce. '249
Instead, they are requiring the executive branch to adhere to the law,
that is, to outcomes that the political process has endorsed. In Lujan,
for example, the plaintiffs would have won only if they could have
shown an unambiguous legislative judgment in their favor.250
Standing would produce "legislative policies that the political process itself
would not enforce" 25 1 only if courts systematically misinterpreted
statutes. But this seems to be an unsupportable assumption.</p>
          <p>In addition, it is hardly a good thing if agency implementation
defeats legislative judgments. Suppose, for example, that the EPA
decided that statutes calling for a form of cost-benefit balancing should
be construed not to allow consideration of costs, and thus to require a
kind of environmental absolutism. Would it be plausible to say that
this is "a good thing," so long as the agency, supervised as it is by the
President, had so concluded? Surely not. Agency rejection of
con248. See Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 2884-85 (1992) (Scalia, J.,

gressional enactments, even if motivated by the President himself, is
inconsistent with the system of separation of powers.</p>
          <p>There are of course important political constraints on
administrative behavior, and an understanding of those constraints is a valuable
part of administrative law.252 Moreover, the power of the executive to
temper legislative enactments is indeed an important aspect of
democratic government. The President can appropriately exercise this
power in many areas, including prosecutorial discretion, interpretation
of ambiguities, incremental policymaking, and not-so-incremental
judgments when Congress has spoken ambiguously. But the executive
is not normally empowered to violate the law through enforcement
activity in violation of the boundaries set by Congress. Justice Scalia
cannot be taken to argue in favor of the "updating" that occurs when
the President implements a law in such a way as to rewrite it.</p>
          <p>To bring this problem closer to the standing issue, suppose that an
agency decides that the ESA should not be applied to American
activities in foreign nations, when in fact Congress plainly intended that the
ESA should apply abroad. Is this a good thing? On the contrary, it is
a violation of democratic aspirations and (more relevant still) of the
system for national lawmaking set up by Articles I and II of the
Constitution. If agency enforcement beyond that intended by Congress is
not "a good thing," even where the agency responds to political
pressures, it is not "a good thing" where an agency undertakes a pattern of
enforcement that violates congressional will through abdication or
failure to act. Asymmetry on this point would simply translate
judicial antipathy to regulation into administrative law. The foreclosure
of standing cannot plausibly be defended as a means of allowing the
bureaucracy to implement the law in a manner that conflicts with the
governing statute.</p>
          <p>Let us turn, finally, to Justice Scalia's argument from democratic
theory, referred to briefly in Lujan itself.253 That argument rests on a
distinction between minority and majority interests. The distinction
between regulatory objects and regulatory beneficiaries, for purposes
of standing, is said to rest on this prior distinction, which is itself said
to be well adapted to the special role of courts in the American legal
system. "Objects" represent a minority whose interests require
judicial protection; "beneficiaries" represent a majority who can protect
their concerns through the political process. But there are two
problems with this argument. The first is that it does not justify a
252. See R. Shep Melnick, AdministrativeLaw andBureaucraticReality, 44 ADMIN. L. REV.
245 (1992).</p>
          <p>253. See Lujan, 112 S. Ct. at 2145.
distinction between the objects and beneficiaries of regulation. The
second is that it turns on an inadequate conception of the workings of
American democracy.</p>
          <p>Suppose we agreed that courts should not protect majority
interests through administrative law. The result would be to jeopardize
standing for many objects of regulation, not merely for beneficiaries.
Often the objects of regulation are indeed majority interests. A
regulation might, for example, affect a large number of companies at once,
and in the process impose costs principally on consumers, which is to
say on nearly all of us. Majorities are affected even when "objects" are
at risk. But objects are not therefore to be deprived of standing, at
least not without wreaking havoc on traditional administrative law.
Indeed, the objects of regulation are not systematically more likely to
be "majorities" than the beneficiaries. If we were to build our theory
of standing on majority status, we must rethink standing in important
ways - but not in the ways recommended by Justice Scalia. The
majority-minority distinction is too crude a basis for distinguishing
beneficiaries from objects.</p>
          <p>Now let us turn to the workings of American democracy. Justice
Scalia's argument seems to be that courts are well-suited to protecting
minorities, which cannot protect themselves through the democratic
process, whereas they are in poor position to protect majorities, whose
natural forum is the democratic process. The politically responsive
institution is in turn the executive branch.</p>
          <p>But this argument is too simple. Some minorities are especially
well-organized and do indeed have access to the political process,
including the executive branch. The point is well documented. 254 At
least sometimes, regulated industries are a prominent example. But
they are not therefore to be deprived of standing.</p>
          <p>Moreover, some majorities are so diffuse and ill-organized that
they face systematic transaction costs barriers to the exercise of
ongoing political influence. This point is well documented in the area of
environmental protection and elsewhere.25 5 The citizen suit is
designed as a corrective. 256 Essentially, this cause of action reflects the
congressional judgment that some interests, including those of
majorities, are so diffuse and unorganized that they require judicial
protection in the implementation process. Congress' judgment to this effect

receives distinguished support from a significant body of empirical and
analytic literature.2 57 Even ifjudges do not agree with that judgment,
they sh6uld not foreclose the cause of action in the name of the
Constitution.</p>
          <p>I conclude that Justice Scalia's essay does not justify the view that
Article III forbids the citizen suit. If Congress has chosen to rely on
the citizen suit, courts should not foreclose that choice.</p>

          <title>Detour 11. The Citizen Suit and the Administrative State</title>
          <p>To make a full evaluation of Lujan, a good empirical picture of the
citizen suit would be valuable. What effect does the citizen suit have
on the real world? Is it a valuable instrument of environmental and
regulatory policy? How many citizen suits have merit? Does the
citizen suit produce greater compliance with the law or better regulatory
policy? In how many cases does the citizen suit facilitate standing, or
simplify standing issues, compared to a requirement of injury in fact?
The answers to such questions may not help with the constitutional
issue. But they will aid in an assessment of whether the demise of
citizen suits is an important event for administrative law.</p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, we have only the most preliminary of answers to
these questions. In the early period of the citizen suit, exceptionally
few plaintiffs filed such actions. 2 58 Advocates of this form of
enforcement were both surprised and greatly disappointed. But recent years,
starting with 1983, have seen greater activity, especially under the
Clean Water Act.259 Betwee
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">n 1984</xref>
            and 1988 (when the EPA ceased
collecting data on citizen suits), there were over 800 notices of intent
to sue under that Act.26° The government was the defendant in 165 of
these suits. Plaintiffs have won a large number of citizen cases under
the Clean Water Act.26 1 Indeed, plaintiffs readily prevail under the
Clean Water Act, apparently because some of the statutory provisions
speak quite plainly and mandate unambiguous action. 262
          </p>
          <p>Post-Lujan, most environmental suits will be able to go forward
under the injury-in-fact requirements. An environmental organization
will typically be able to find a member who has the requisite injury.263
But the need to show an injury will complicate such suits, and some
occasions will arise when no plaintiff can be found. Moreover,
regulatory cases will arise in which the insistence on an actual injury, as
understood in Lujan, will bar the action altogether. I discuss this
possibility in Part III.</p>
          <p>There is good reason to believe that the citizen suit has indeed
helped bring about greater administrative compliance with law. But
there is no reason to think that the citizen suit is a fundamental part of
modem regulatory reform. I offer a brief account of a long story
here.264</p>
          <p>In its current form, the citizen suit should be seen as part and
parcel of a largely unsuccessful system of command-and-control
regulation. Under this system, Congress entrusts agencies with the job of
issuing a massive number of highly centralized, rigid, and often
draconian regulatory requirements. It should be no surprise that agencies
are often unable to undertake their legally required tasks, especially in
view of the fact that they infrequently receive the necessary resources.
The citizen suit is part of a complex system in which Congress
delegates difficult or even impossible tasks, appropriates inadequate
resources, imposes firm and sometimes unrealistic deadlines, 265 and
enlists courts and citizens in order to produce compliance. 266 The
system may well find explanation in terms of the self-interest of elected
representatives. 267 Credit-claiming for apparently aggressive

tion can coexist with a range of real-world loopholes, helping industry
to escape from government controls. But the public is often the loser.</p>
          <p>In these circumstances, the citizen suit is probably best understood
as a band-aid superimposed on a system that can meet with only
mixed success. Instead of band-aids, modem regulation requires
fundamental reform. Congress should replace the command-and-control
system with more flexible, incentive-oriented measures. 268 Instead of a
continuing emphasis on judicial review, modem bureaucracy needs
large-scale shifts introduced and implemented by legislators and
administrators themselves.269 We should not, however, forget that
bandaids can do some good. The citizen suit may serve as an effective if
partial alternative to massive regulatory overhaul. In any case, the
complex policy issues do not bear on the interpretation of Article III.</p>

      <title>Coda: What the Court Should Have Said</title>
      <p>From what has been said thus far, we can offer some brief general
words about the law of standing and Lujan itself. With respect to
standing in general, the key question is whether Congress (or some
other relevant source of law) has created a cause of action. Without a
cause of action, there is no standing; there is no case or controversy;
and courts are without authority to hear the case under Article III.</p>
      <p>This point suggests that the real source of current difficulty is Data
Processing, which diverted attention from the relevant question of
cause of action to the irrelevant question of injury in fact. So long as
injury in fact was thought to be the issue that Congress itself had made
relevant under the APA, the difficulty was only minor. But when an
injury in fact became both a necessary and sufficient condition for
standing, the area grew badly confused.</p>
      <p>The result was that courts began to grant standing in cases in
which it should have been denied, and to deny standing in cases in
which it should have been granted. 270 Worse, the Court viewed the
EcON. &amp; ORGANIZATION 59 (1992) (discussing the symbiotic relationship between legislators
and environmental groups).</p>
      <p>268. See SuNsTIN, supra note 162, ch. 3; Bruce A. Ackerman &amp; Richard B. Stewart,

      <p>270. Thus, for example, the court granted standing in United States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 669
(1973), an environmental case in which the law student plaintiffs could not easily show a cause of
action conferred by Congress. Standing should almost certainly have been denied in SCRAP,
even if an injury in fact might have been found.
standing issue through the wrong lens. An injury in fact is not
required by Article III, and it is not sufficient for standing.27 1 Both
history and principle show that people with "injuries in fact" may or may
not have standing. The question is whether Congress has conferred a
right to bring suit.</p>
      <p>Under this view of the matter, Lujan was a relatively simple case.
The first question was one of positive law: whether Congress had
granted or denied standing to the plaintiffs. Congress' grant of
standing resolved that issue. The grant created the relevant injury for
Article III purposes. There was no need to start with injury in fact and
redressability, or even to address these issues at all. And if it should
be thought - contrary to the view presented here - that there are
some Article III limits on legislative power to confer causes of action
on citizens, those limits surely were not reached in Lujan. This was,
after all, a case in which the plaintiffs claimed an intention to go to a
place where allegedly unlawful government expenditures placed
endangered species at risk. The Constitution did not forbid that action
from going forward. The Lujan Court should not have discussed
redressability; the congressional grant of standing disposed of the
issue. If redressability was relevant, the Court should have said that the
injury created by Congress - to prevent the U.S. government from
threatening to produce extinction - would indeed have been
redressed by a decree in the plaintiffs' favor.272</p>
      <p>Lujan settled some important questions. But it left many issues
open, and it raised at least as many new ones. The future looks
particularly murky in light of Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion, which
refused to join the plurality on redressability, questioned any focus on
the common law as the exclusive source of injury, and suggested
relatively broad congressional power on the issues of injury and
causation. 273</p>
      <p>In this Part, I outline the settled and unsettled issues. I also
suggest how some of the current puzzles should be resolved. The most
important conclusions involve possible congressional responses to
LuJan. I suggest that the simplest and most effective response would be
the creation of a bounty for successful citizen plaintiffs. Such a bounty
271. See Fletcher, supra note 15, at 223.</p>
      <p>272. See infra text accompanying notes 307-10 (suggesting that the ESA should be thought
to confer a property interest on citizens).</p>
      <p>273. See supra text accompanying notes 188-93.
would build directly on the qui tam and informers' actions, and it
should not raise a constitutional problem in the aftermath of Lujan.</p>
      <p>A more complex response would be for Congress expressly to
create a property interest in the various regulatory "goods" that it wants
to authorize citizens to protect. It might, for example, say that
citizens generally have a beneficial interest in certain endangered species
that are at risk from acts of the U.S. government. This somewhat
adventurous strategy would have the advantages of building on common
law notions of interest and injury and of forcing focused congressional
attention on the precise nature of the rights at stake. It would also
respond to some of the concerns in Justice Kennedy's concurrence.
Despite its relative novelty, an approach of this sort should also be
constitutional.</p>
      <p>A.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-8">
      <title>Easy Cases: What Lujan Permits</title>
      <p>The Lujan opinion does not reject a number of cases in which
courts have given standing to environmental plaintiffs. On the
contrary, it expressly endorses many such cases, even when the plaintiff is
complaining that the executive has taken inadequate action to enforce
the law. To this extent, the invalidation of the citizen suit allows a
good deal of room for private litigants - regulatory beneficiaries - to
initiate proceedings against the executive branch. The case therefore
introduces some uncertainty into the law, but it probably does not
work any fundamental shift in the environmental area.</p>
      <p>The Court thus makes clear that, if an environmental plaintiff can
show that its members use the particular environmental resource that
is at risk, standing is available. It follows, for example, that a citizen
in New York could, post-Lujan, complain about the failure to enforce
clean air or clean water requirements in New York. The Court
suggests as much by invoking the Japan Whaling case274 to show that an
environmental organization could complain of excessive whale
harvesting when the "whale watching and studying of their members
w[ould] be adversely affected by continued whale harvesting. ' 275 The
Court also says that a citizens' council has standing to bring suit to
challenge environmentally harmful construction in the area where its
members live.276

      <p>276. 112 S.Ct. at 2143 n.8 (endorsing standing in Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens
Council, 490 U.S. 332 (1989)).</p>
      <p>It also remains clear that some procedural injuries can produce
standing under Article III. The Court writes:</p>
      <p>This is not a case where plaintiffs are seeking to enforce a procedural
requirement the disregard of which could impair a separate concrete
interest of theirs (ag., the procedural requirement for a hearing prior to
denial of their license application, or the procedural requirement for an
environmental impact statement before a federal facility is constructed
next door to them).2 7 7
A citizen can thus complain about a failure to prepare an
environmental impact statement (EIS) even though it is "speculative" whether the
statement will cause the project to be abandoned.278</p>
      <p>Standing remains available in all cases under the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)279 whenever plaintiffs can show that
the project, if completed, would adversely affect their interests. A
concrete injury of this kind is sufficient even if ordinary redressability
cannot be shown. "The person who has been accorded a procedural right
to protect his concrete interests can assert that right without meeting
all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy. 2 80</p>
      <p>It is clear that the Court believes this; but, as noted above, it is not
clear why the Court does so. If Article III requires redressability,
most NEPA suits indeed seem unconstitutional. In the typical NEPA
action, there is no assurance that completion of an adequate EIS
would have any consequence at all for the plaintiffs. One might well
think, as the government urged in Lujan, that NEPA suits frequently
violate Article III.</p>
      <p>But as the Lujan Court appears to acknowledge, this would be an
odd and far-reaching conclusion. It is almost always the case that
procedural rights have only speculative consequences for a litigant. If a
judge is found to have ruled in favor of party A after taking a bribe
from party A, it remains speculative whether an unbiased judge would
have ruled for party B. Does party B therefore lack standing? Or
suppose that an administrator is found to have violated the
Administrative Procedure Act by promulgating a regulation without first
publishing it for comment in the Federal Register. It is entirely
speculative whether compliance would make any difference to the
complainants. The Lujan Court, however, does not want the
redressability requirement to bar standing in such cases.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the Court is endorsing Justice Kennedy's suggestion that

"Congress has the power to define injuries and articulate chains of
causation that will give rise to a case or controversy where none
existed before. ' 281 More deeply, however, I think that the Court's
conclusion on this point exemplifies several of the problems associated
with the whole notion of redressability. A procedural right is created,
not because it necessarily yields particular outcomes, but because it
structures incentives and creates pressures that Congress has deemed
important to effective regulation. The same is true for the sorts of
interests at stake in the ESA and in many other environmental
statutes. Congress is attempting not to dictate outcomes but to create
procedural guarantees that will produce certain regulatory incentives.
Redressability in the conventional sense is irrelevant.</p>
      <p>This point might well have arisen in Lujan itself. Even though it
did not, the opinion makes clear that procedural harms remain
cognizable when ordinary injuries are involved, despite the absence of
redressability.</p>

        <title>Easy Cases: What Lujan Forecloses</title>
        <p>Thus far I have explained the types of suits Lujan has left
untouched. But it is equally clear that Lujan forecloses "pure" citizen
suits. In these suits, a stranger with an ideological or law-enforcement
interest initiates a proceeding against the government, seeking to
require an agency to undertake action of the sort required by law. Many
environmental statutes now allow such actions, and plaintiffs have
brought many suits of this kind. Under Lujan, these suits are
unacceptable. Congress must at a minimum "identify the injury it seeks to
vindicate and relate the injury to the class of persons entitled to bring
suit. '2 82 If Congress has simply given standing to citizens, 283 this
requirement has not been met. The plaintiff must point to a concrete
injury, not merely to a congressional grant of standing.</p>

    <sec id="sec-9">
      <title>C. Injury in Fact?</title>
      <p>The discussion thus far has focused to a large extent on changes in
the law of injury in fact. Lujan extends this change, placing a renewed
emphasis on the notion that the harm must be imminent and
nonspeculative. This requirement will likely carry more weight than it has
in the past. Before Lujan, requiring people to obtain a plane ticket or
to make firm plans to visit the habitat of endangered species might

well have been unnecessarily formalistic. Now such actions are
apparently required. But this is not a fundamental revision of previous law.
The celebrated SCRAP case284 is probably a relic. But on that point,
the handwriting had been on the wall a long time, and, if the analysis
thus far is correct, there is no reason to mourn for SCRAP, in which
Congress had not conferred a right to bring suit.</p>
      <p>Harder questions could arise in consumer cases, which play a large
role in contemporary administrative law. Suppose, for example, that
the government imposes on automobile manufacturers fuel economy
requirements that are less stringent than the law requires. 28 5
Typically, plaintiffs will argue that their injury consists of a diminished
opportunity to purchase the products in question.286 After Lujan,
standing becomes a difficult issue in such cases. A court might find
that the plaintiffs lack a concrete or particularized interest. They are
perhaps not readily distinguished from the public at large. There is an
issue about speculativeness as well: perhaps the relationship between a
consumer and a product that he allegedly wants is the same as the
relationship between the Lujan plaintiffs and an endangered species, in
the sense that in neither case is it clear that the injury will occur as a
result of the complained-of government acts.</p>
      <p>A consumer case of this sort may differ from Lujan, however, in
the important sense that a consumer who complains of a diminished
opportunity to purchase a product can very plausibly claim that he
will in fact purchase that product. This claim is probably less
speculative than that in Lujan. It is possible to discount an "intention" to
undertake difficult foreign travel at an unspecified time; the intention
may not show sufficient likelihood of harm. But it is harder to
discount an intention to purchase a specified product, which usually
applies to a single, simple transaction. The distinction suggests that, at
least as Lujan stands, it does not significantly affect the standard
consumers' action. In the automobile case, the key point is that a
moreor-less sharply defined category of consumers is distinctly affected in a
relatively nonspeculative way, and this is probably enough for
standing. 287</p>
      <p>The same would be true in the standard broadcasting case, in
284. United States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 669 (1973).</p>

which listeners or viewers in a defined area, or of defined
programming, challenge an FCC decision that bears on their programming
choices. 288 If the FCC refuses to license a classical music station,
there is a concrete injury, and it is sufficiently particularized under
Lujan. The intention to listen to a station is not as conjectural as the
travel intention at issue in Lujan.</p>
      <p>Greater difficulties may arise in some similar actions, as when, for
example, consumers challenge an FDA or EPA regulation allowing
carcinogens to be added to food. 289 There may be serious standing
problems in such cases. A person complaining about such a regulation
might be said to be suffering an injury that is speculative or
generalized. This is especially likely insofar as the injury is characterized as
an actual incidence of cancer. It is extremely speculative to suggest
that the introduction of carcinogenic substances into food additives
will produce cancer in particular human beings.</p>
      <p>The issue becomes harder if the injury is characterized as a greater
risk of cancer. In that event, the injury is less speculative; but it is
unclear that it is sufficiently particularized. On Justice Kennedy's
view, there is probably enough for standing, for he insisted that
standing can exist even if the injury is very widely shared. 290 This is indeed
the correct view, because it is the most plausible conception of the
injury that Congress sought to prevent.29 1 But the issue is now open.</p>

      <title>D. Redressability</title>
      <p>Because only four justices concluded that the redressability
requirement had not been met in Lujan, the case probably offers no real
lessons on that issue. After Lujan, the law of redressability thus
remains as it was before: Extremely fuzzy and highly manipulable. It is
manipulable, first, because there is no clear metric by which to decide
whether it is "speculative" to say that a decree will remedy the
plaintiff's injury. It is manipulable, second, because, as we have seen,
whether an injury is redressable depends on how it is defined. If the
injury in the Bakke case was defined as the right to attend law school,
the redressability requirement was violated. If the injury in a standard
environmental case is defined as the right not to suffer concrete
personal health damage as a result of environmental harm, many
environ288. See, eg., Office of Communication of the United Church of Christ v. FCC, 359 F.2d
994, 1002 (D.C. Cir. 1967).</p>

mental plaintiffs will be unable to show redressability. If, however, the
injury is defined as freedom from a certain risk of health damage, there
is no problem of redressability. This indeed appears to be the way
courts conventionally treat the issue.</p>
      <p>Consider, for example, some of the regulatory cases described
above. If an agency changes its policy for determining fuel efficiency,
will prospective purchasers of fuel-efficient vehicles be affected? The
answer is not clear. Perhaps manufacturers would simply pay civil
penalties, rather than change their behavior. 292 It is speculative
whether government policies will change the policies of manufacturers
soon enough to affect particular consumer choices. 293 If the EPA
refuses to allow carcinogens onto the market, perhaps the consumer will
get cancer in any event; perhaps he will not get cancer whatever the
EPA does. In fact, the EPA decision may well not make the difference
in the life of any particular person. Standing might therefore be
denied on grounds of redressability.</p>
      <p>If we were to start afresh, the best way to handle the issue would
be to say that the question of standing depends on whether Congress
has authorized the plaintiff to bring suit. We should be asking
whether the injury that Congress sought to prevent would likely be
redressed by a favorable judgment.2 94 The redressability requirement
might be understood as a crude way of asking that very question under
the general rubric of "injury in fact." We might therefore try to
answer the redressability question by characterizing the injury in the way
desired by Congress, and then seeing if that injury would be removed
by a decree in the plaintiff's favor. Through this route, the question of
characterization could be resolved through legislative judgments, not
judicial ones. And while the resulting issues of statutory
interpretation will not always be simple, they raise the right questions.</p>

[Tihe causation and redressability question is meaningful only at the level of determining
whether a cause of action should exist for a certain group of plaintiffs under a particular
statutory or constitutional provision .... [G]iven the different purposes of different
statutory and constitutional provisions, some variation is entirely appropriate from one provision
to another.... The question is whether, under the statutory or constitutional provision at
issue, the particular provision should be read to protect against the injury asserted by the
kind of person who is seeking to bring suit.</p>

a minimum, we know that Congress cannot grant standing to people
who have no personal stake in the outcome of an agency action. But
Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice Souter, said that Congress "has the
power to define injuries and articulate chains of causation that will
give rise to a case or controversy where none existed before. '2 95 This
is a potentially crucial phrase. What does it mean? At a minimum, it
means that Congress can create rights foreign to the common law.
These include the right to be free from discrimination,2 96 the right to
occupational safety,2 97 indeed, the vast panoply of statutory rights
going beyond common law understandings. It must also mean that
Congress has the power to find causation, perhaps deploying its factfinding
power, where courts would not do so. 298 Justice Kennedy thus
suggests that Congress can find causation and redressability even where
courts would disagree. Perhaps courts will review such findings under
a deferential standard.</p>
      <p>This view would not change the outcome in Lujan. In that case,
there was no injury in fact. But it might well make a difference in the
several cases in which the Court has previously rejected standing on
grounds of causation and redressability. Congress might well have the
power to alter those outcomes.</p>
      <p>Suppose, for example, that Congress found that efforts to produce
desegregation were adversely affected by a grant of tax deductions to
schools that discriminated on the basis of race. This finding might
well call for a reversal of the outcome in Allen v. Wright.29 9 Or
suppose that Congress found that failure to attain national ambient air
quality standards in New York had adverse health effects on the
citizens of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania.
Perhaps courts would have to respect this finding.</p>

"power to define injuries." Can Congress say that opportunity-type
injuries are legally cognizable? Might Congress follow the Bakke
strategy and conclude that standing exists in many cases involving
increases in risks or attempts to alter incentives? Lujan provides no
authoritative answer. But Justice Kennedy's concurrence suggests that
Congress does possess power to define these events as injuries for
purposes of standing. Justice Kennedy emphasized that standing need not
be based solely on common law-like injuries; his concern was that, in
creating the citizen suit, Congress had not even identified the injury it
was attempting to redress. Congress can meet this concern by
identifying injuries, building on the common law framework to recognize
probabilistic, systemic, or regulatory harms. The decreased
probability of injury, the grant of opportunities, and the provision of
appropriate incentives are key goals of the regulatory state. It should
not be dificult for Congress to connect these goals to the injuries it
seeks to prevent. Nothing in Article III forbids this course, even after</p>

    <sec id="sec-12">
      <title>Lujan. F. Private Defendants</title>
      <p>Many citizen-suit provisions in the environmental laws give the
citizen the option of initiating proceedings against the private defendant
allegedly operating in violation of federal law. Formally, Lujan did
not address this strategy because the case involved a governmental
defendant. Does Lujan affect suits against private persons? The answer
is unclear. We have seen that a large part of the Court's opinion relies
on the fear that, without a particularized injury, courts will be
displacing executive power under the Take Care Clause. This concern is
entirely inapplicable when the executive is not even a party. 3°° On the
other hand, if Article III does indeed require a personal stake, the
identity of the defendant should not matter. A case in which a citizen
initiates proceedings against a private defendant would indeed test the
claim that the Take Care Clause is a major impetus behind the Lujan
decision.</p>
      <p>I have argued that this claim makes little sense. If so, and if Lujan
remains good law, a citizen should not have standing to proceed
against a private defendant unless he can show some kind of personal
300. A qualification is necessary here. When private people sue other private people to
enforce federal statutory law, there is a lurking issue about private interference with the exercise of
prosecutorial discretion, and hence with the President's "Take Care" power. But this issue
surely does not have constitutional status. Parallel public and private remedies are most familiar
to American law; they do not violate the Constitution.
stake. After Lujan, the citizen-suit provisions are probably
unconstitutional even when the defendant is a private citizen or corporation.</p>
      <p>G.</p>
      <p>Perhaps Congress can respond to Lujan by granting cash bounties
to citizen plaintiffs. Indeed, this possibility might produce some of the
most important and difficult post-Lujan issues. If Congress wants to
reinstate the citizen suit after Lujan, a cash bounty would be the
simplest strategy. Indeed, an exceedingly short amendment to existing
law, giving a bounty to all successful citizen plaintiffs, should be
sufficient. For reasons that follow, the bounty should create an interest
and hence standing. In this way, a system of bounties would fully
overcome the post-Lujan doubts about the citizen suit. A bounty
system would also be more straightforward than the principal alternative
strategy now available to Congress, involving restructured property
rights. 30 1</p>
      <p>A bounty system would have the important advantage of building
on the clear historical precedents of qui tam and informers' actions,
precedents that are firmly established in American law.302 To the
extent that the citizen suit is a helpful device,303 Congress should be
encouraged to take this step. At least where administrative inaction is
both harmful and predictable, and where it cannot be prevented
through more fundamental regulatory reform, 304 a bounty system
would make a great deal of sense. Indeed, the creation of a system of
citizen bounties could well be a major step in administrative law.</p>

    <sec id="sec-13">
      <title>1. PrivateDefendants</title>
      <p>In the first case, Congress might allow citizens to proceed against
polluters or others without requiring a conventional injury in fact, but
with provision for a financial bounty to victorious citizen litigants.
Does the bounty create the requisite personal interest or concrete
stake?</p>
      <p>In this context, Lujan is probably inapplicable by its own rationale.
There is no risk that courts will usurp executive functions under the
Take Care Clause. The executive is not a defendant. Not only is the
executive not involved, but the plaintiff has a concrete interest in the
form of the bounty. Standing seems perfectly appropriate. In fact, the

Lujan Court seemed to invite this conclusion: "Nor, finally, is [this]
the unusual case in which Congress has created a concrete private
interest in the outcome of a suit against a private party for the
government's benefit, by providing a cash bounty for the victorious
plaintiff. ' 30 5 The qui tam action and the informers' action 30 6 seem to
be decisive precedents in favor of this conclusion. In both of these
actions, a bounty was provided, and it would be most adventurous to
say that these arrangements violated Article III.</p>
      <p>In the second case, Congress might give a cash bounty to litigants
who have prevailed against the government. It might, for example,
award $500 to plaintiffs in cases involving environmental harms. It
might even amend all current citizen-suit provisions in order to
provide a cash bounty. A simple statute could accomplish this goal.
Would this entail a different outcome from that in Lujan?</p>
      <p>The answer is unclear. On the one hand, the executive remains a
defendant, and the Lujan objection from the Take Care Clause
remains. On the other hand, the existence of a cash bounty gives the
plaintiff the equivalent of a personal stake in the outcome, just like a
case in which she has a right to obtain damages from a common law
tortfeasor. This personal stake is probably sufficient to create
standing. Here the informers' action is a direct precedent.</p>
      <p>The Take Care Clause, even as understood in Lujan, is likely to be
held irrelevant where a bounty is at stake. According to the Court, the
clause furnishes no objection in a case in which the plaintiff can show
that the government's allegedly unlawful inaction impairs her
enjoyment of some environmental asset. Hence the Take Care Clause is not
a freestanding objection to suits of this general kind. It is called into
play only in cases without a personal stake for the plaintiff. If a
plaintiff can show that she stands to gain or lose from the outcome of the
action, she is no longer interested only in "law enforcement for its own
sake." She thus has standing to initiate the action.</p>
      <p>If this analysis is correct, Congress has available a relatively simple
corrective to Lujan if it believes that the decision will significantly
undermine its regulatory goals. Existing statutes can be simply amended
through the grant of a bounty to victorious citizen plaintiffs. No
Article III problem would result from this initiative. If Congress wants to
overcome Lujan, this is the best and simplest route. It would make

Lujan draws them into severe doubt.</p>

    <sec id="sec-14">
      <title>H. Redefined PropertyRights</title>
      <p>I have criticized the injury-in-fact test on the ground that it
undermines Congress' power to create property rights where they had not
existed before. In Lujan, the plaintiffs might well have asserted that
the conferral of a cause of action amounted to the creation of a form of
property. Justice Kennedy had an answer to this claim: "Congress
has the power to define injuries and articulate chains of causation that
will give rise to a case or controversy where none existed before. '30 7
But here Congress has refused to "identify the injury it seeks to
vindicate and relate the injury to the class of persons entitled to bring
suit. ' 30 8 Apparently, plaintiffs had no property right under the ESA,
because Congress failed explicitly to define the relevant injury when it
provided for citizen suits.</p>
      <p>Suppose, then, that Congress attempts to create a citizen suit in the
following way. It announces, first, that all Americans have a kind of
property right - a tenancy in common - in some environmental
asset. The asset might be clean air anywhere in the country, or pristine
areas, or the continued existence of endangered species in the United
States or abroad. If this seems odd, we might note that Congress
could surely create property rights in unowned land within the United
States; to the extent that such rights do not interfere with the claims of
a competing sovereign, Congress can create them with respect to
unowned land outside our territorial borders. 309 And surely Congress'
capacity to create property rights is not limited to land. If Congress
thus defines property rights and injuries and creates a correlative cause
of action, has it acted appropriately and met Justice Kennedy's
concern?</p>
      <p>The answer would seem to be affirnmative. The advantages of
express legislative creation of a property right are that it would build on
common law understandings and produce more focused congressional
deliberation on the nature of the interest it is creating. The citizen suit

      <p>309. The point may seem odd, but we can imagine an example. Suppose that an area in
Argentina produces medicines especially beneficial to Americans. Suppose that the activities of
private American companies in Argentina threaten to industrialize that area and thus to
eliminate its medicinal capacities. Congress might respond by forbidding these activities and by
creating a property right in all Americans, operating only against other Americans, to the continued
productivity of the area. This could not possibly raise a constitutional issue, or even a problem of
international law.
has become a relatively automatic part of environmental law, with
little legislative attention to its nature and consequences. If the citizen
suit is in fact intended to give all citizens the equivalent of a beneficial
interest in environmental quality, it may well be desirable to focus
congressional attention on exactly that question. And if Congress
concludes that it seeks to create this kind of property, there should be no
constitutional problem.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the case would seem to be very close to Havens Realty,3 10
discussed above. If there is a difference, it is that, in the cases under
discussion, Congress has created a tenancy in common with respect to
a collective good - that is, property that is jointly owned. In Havens
Realty, by contrast, the property right could be held by individuals
rather than many people at once.</p>
      <p>Under Justice Scalia's conception of standing, this distinction
would make a difference. In the collective good case, unlike in Havens
Realty, we are hardly dealing with "minorities." Majorities may have
less need for the citizen suit. But this conception of standing faces
many problems, as elaborated above. In any event, Justice Kennedy
clearly disagrees on this point. His opinion plainly says that standing
is not to be denied simply because many people are adversely affected.</p>
      <p>If all this is correct, some of the most interesting developments in
the law of standing may arise when Congress is explicit in its intention
to create new forms of property adapted to the problems and
aspirations of modem regulation. If Congress creates property rights in
environmental assets of various sorts, and grants correlative causes of
action, it should be able to overcome the strictures of Lujan. Faced
with such an enactment, the Court would not be dealing with a
"citizen suit" at all. Instead it would be faced with a suit brought by
property holders equipped with causes of action; and it would be odd if
congressional initiatives in this direction would be held inconsistent
with Article III.</p>
      <p>CONCLUSION</p>
      <p>At least in general, standing depends on whether any source of law
has created a cause of action. To a large extent, that question is for
congressional resolution. Congress can create standing as it chooses
and, in general, can deny standing when it likes. 311 As an abstraction
310. Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363 (1982); see supra notes 125-29 and
accompanying text.</p>
      <p>311. The foreclosure of standing might, however, raise problems under Article III and the
Due Process Clause. On Article III, see Richard H. Fallon, OfLegislative Courts,Administrative
Agencies, andArticle II 101 HARv. L. REv. 915 (1988); on due process, see Yakus v. United
independent of what the law says, an injury in fact is neither a
necessary nor a sufficient condition for standing. Indeed, the notion of
injury in fact is a form of Lochner-style substantive due process. It
assumes that there can be a factual inquiry into "injury" independent
of evaluation and of legal conventions. There can be no such law-free
inquiry. It is a conceptual impossibility, indeed a form of metaphysics.</p>
      <p>Despite the holding of Lujan, Congress should be permitted to
grant standing to citizens. The text and history of Article III provide
no support for judicial invalidation of congressional grants of citizen
standing. On the contrary, England, the American colonies, and early
Congresses all granted standing to strangers. No one suggested that
this practice violated the Constitution. The Lujan Court's
unprecedented invalidation of a provision for citizen standing has no basis in
Article III. The Court should not have reached its important
conclusion without investigating the relevant history, and the odd evolution
of standing doctrine, in much more detail.</p>
      <p>Lujan answers a long-unresolved issue; but it leaves a number of
other significant questions unanswered. I have tried to describe how
they might be resolved. It seems clear that citizen-suit provisions are
now impermissible in the absence of a showing of injury in fact. But
Lujan permits environmental actions whenever plaintiffs can show
that environmental degradation will affect their geographical area in
the form of dirtier air, dirtier water, or inferior aesthetics. Many suits
by regulatory beneficiaries will thus remain viable.</p>
      <p>Perhaps most important, Congress probably retains a relatively
simple mechanism by which to accomplish the purposes that underlie
current provisions for citizen actions. Certainly it can grant citizens
standing against private defendants so long as it allows some kind of
bounty for a victorious lawsuit. Almost certainly, Lujan permits
Congress to allow citizens to bring suit against the government for
insufficient regulatory action, if a bounty is made available in the event of
success.</p>
      <p>Most intriguingly, Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion leaves
open the possibility that Congress has the power to create quite novel
property interests, to grant those interests to many people or even to
citizens, and to confer standing to enable people to vindicate those
interests. It may be that, in cases raising this issue, we will see the
ultimate depth of the Court's commitment to Lujan's odd adventure in
substantive due process.</p>
