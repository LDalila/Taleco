Cass R. Sunsteint

There  are  deep  and fundamental  and  intuitively  understood
grounds  for rejecting  the view  that  confines  itself merely  to
checking  the  parity  of  outcomes,  the  view  that  matches
death  for  death,  happiness  for  happiness,  fulfillment  for
fulfillment,  irrespective  of how all  this  death, happiness  and
fulfillment  comes  about.

I.  THE PROBLEM

The  fiftieth  anniversary  of  the  Administrative  Procedure
Act2  arrives  at  a  time  when  administrative  institutions  are  re-
ceiving more  serious public attention  than in any period since  the
New  Deal.  The New  Deal was  committed  to immensely  strength-
ened  national  institutions  and  to  large  and  largely  independent
bureaucratic  entities?  These  commitments  are  now  under  severe
strain.  Much  of this  was  signalled  by  the  election  of  President
Reagan  in  1980  and,  in  particular,  by his  promulgation  of a con-
troversial  executive  order  calling  for  attention  to  the  costs  and
benefits  of regulatory  initiatives.4  In  1993,  it  was  firmly  estab-
lished  that a new  direction  had been  set, when  President  Clinton
issued  a new  executive  order  that  substantially  overlapped  with
President  Reagan's.5

Nor  has  the  national  legislature  refused  to  reexamine  the
legacy  of the  New  Deal.  In  1994  and  1995,  Congress  devoted  a
good  deal  of attention  to  the  costs  and  benefits  of  government
regulation.  Before  long, it may  enact  a  "supermandate" requiring
cost-benefit  balancing  from  all  agencies.'  In  the  near  future,
Congress  may  well  enact  legislation  that  is  a mixture  of a  new
Administrative  Procedure  Act  and  an  Administrative  Substance
Act.7  Such  legislation  may ultimately  be  seen  as  part  of a "con-
stitutional moment" involving large-scale  revision  of fundamental
national  commitments.8

If such  a revision does  occur, it will be partly  a product  of an
immense  wealth  of new  learning  about  the  nature  and  perfor-
mance  of the regulatory  state.  This learning  has  emphasized  the
need  for better  priority  setting,9  for  more  flexible  tools,'0  for bal-
ancing  rather  than  absolutism,"  and  for  closer  attention  to  the
unanticipated  adverse  effects  of  regulation.'  These  points  do
not  suggest  that  the  regulatory  state  has failed.  In many  areas,
things  are  much  better  because  of regulatory  initiatives."  But
with  better  strategies  and  tools,  existing  pathologies  could  be
sharply reduced,  thus  saving  many  billions  of dollars  and  many
lives  in  the  process.  For  example,  a  recent  study  suggests  that
better  allocations  of existing  health  expenditures  could  save  an
additional  sixty thousand lives with no  additional  cost-and that

with  better  allocations,  we  could  prevent  the  same  number  of
deaths  we now  prevent with $31  billion in annual  savings.'4

During the  twentieth-century  explosion  in regulatory  activi-
ty-including  the  New  Deal  and  the  "rights  revolution"  of  the
1960s  and  1970s-there  was  no  effort  to create  a general  mecha-
nism  for  monitoring  regulatory  performance.  But  with new  em-
pirical  studies  of the effects  of regulation, it is now  clear that the
national  government  has  failed  adequately  to  perform  the  tasks
assigned  to  it  and  that  it  has  sometimes  made  things  worse.
Increasingly it is  asked whether the costs  of regulation justify the
benefits.  Hence  assessment  of  regulatory  performance  has  in-
creasingly  taken the  form of the criterion  of cost-benefit  analysis,
and  hence  the  American  administrative  state  is  increasingly
becoming  a  cost-benefit  state.  This  is  so  despite  the  fact  that
there  is  much  controversy  about  how  to  value  and  characterize
both costs  and benefits.' 5

My  purpose  in this  Essay is  to  discuss  a  pervasive  problem
in risk regulation,  one  that helps  account  for regulatory  failure,
that is  an  intriguing  part  of cost-benefit  assessment,"  and  that
is  only  now  receiving  public  attention.'7  The  problem  occurs
when the diminution of one health risk simultaneously increases anoth-
er health risk. Thus,  for  example,  fuel  economy  standards,  de-
signed to reduce environmental  risks, may make  automobiles  less
safe,  and  in  that way  increase  risks  to  life  and  health."  Regula-
tions designed  to control the  spread  of AIDS and  hepatitis among
health care  providers  may  increase  the  costs  of health  care,  and
thus  make  health  care  less  widely  available,  and  thus  cost
lives. 9  If government  bans  the  manufacture  and  use  of asbestos,

it  may  lead companies  to  use  more  dangerous  substitutes.0  Reg-
ulation  of nuclear  power  may  make  nuclear  power  safer;  but by
increasing the  cost  of nuclear  power,  such  regulation  will  ensure
reliance  on  other  energy  sources,  such  as coal-fired  power plants,
which  carry  risks  of  their  own.2'  When  government  requires  re-
formulated  gasoline  as  a substitute  for ordinary  gasoline,  it  may
reduce  carbon  monoxide  emissions  but  produce  new  pollution
problems  from  hydrocarbons  and  smog.22  When government  reg-
ulates  air  pollution,  it  may  encourage  industry  to  increase  the
volume  of solid  waste, and  in that sense  aggravate  another envi-
ronmental  problem.  A  ban on  carcinogens  in food  additives  may
lead  consumers  to use  noncarcinogenic  products  that carry  great-
er risks in terms of diseases  other than  cancer."

The  general  problem  is  ubiquitous.  It  stems  from  the  fact
that government  officials,  like  individual  citizens  and  the  public
as  a whole,  suffer from  both limited  information  and  (even more
importantly)  selective  attention.'  A  large  current  priority  is  to
develop  mechanisms  that  overcome  the  problems  posed  by  the
fact  that  people-both  citizens  and  regulators-tend  to  focus  on
problems  that  are  parts  of  complex  wholes.  Such  a  mechanism
should  take  account  of Sen's  point  in the  epigraph  to  this Essay.
Risks  to  life  and health  are  qualitatively  diverse,  and  because  of
their  origins  and  nature,  some  risks  warrant  greater  attention
than others.

My goal here is to  explore the relation between  health-health
tradeoffs  and  the law, in an  effort  to see  how governmental  judg-
ments  on this topic might be improved.  I  develop  a simple frame-
work  for  deciding  how  regulatory  agencies  should  approach  such
tradeoffs.  I  suggest  that  this framework  is  complicated  by  refer-
ence  to  some  peculiar  features  of individual  and  collective  ratio-
nality in risk assessment.

Health-Health Tradeoffs

1537

I  also  deal with the  respective  roles  of courts,  Congress,  and
the  President  in  managing  health-health  tradeoffs.  I  urge  that
often agencies  ought  to be  taken to have  legal  authority to  make
such  tradeoffs,  and  that  they  ought  to  exercise  that  authority
much more  than they now do.  To this end I argue  for an interpre-
tive  principle  to  the  effect  that  agencies  should  be  allowed  to
consider health-health  tradeoffs  in the absence  of a clear congres-
sional  statement  to  the  contrary.  I  also  urge  a  modest  but  far
from  trivial judicial  role in  requiring  agencies  to  consider  aggre-
gate  rather  than  isolated  risks.  Thus  I  claim  that  agency  deci-
sions  that  increase  aggregate  risk  levels  should  be  found  arbi-
trary or capricious  under the Administrative  Procedure Act.25

More  generally,  I urge  that Congress  should amend  the Ad-
ministrative  Procedure  Act ("APA")  to require  agencies  to  consid-
er ancillary risks  and to minimize  net  risks. I also  argue that the
Office  of Information  and Regulatory  Affairs  ("OIRA")  should  see
the  reduction  of  overall  risk  as  one  of  its  principal  missions.
Much  more  than it now  does,  it should  undertake  a coordinating
function  so  as to ensure  that this  mission is  carried out.

In  these  ways,  I  hope  to  connect  the  question  of  sensible
outcomes-outcomes  that do not suffer from the problem  of exces-
sively  selective  attention-with  the  subject  of  institutional  de-
sign.  A  large  problem  for  government  institutions  is  to  devise
systems  to  ensure  that problems  of myopia  or  selective  attention
do  not  defeat  regulatory  regimes;  the  management  of  health-
health tradeoffs  is  an important part of that project.

Part  II  of  this Essay  provides  a  simple  conceptual  map,  de-
signed  to  draw some  relevant  distinctions.  Part  III  offers  a  first
approximation  of  an  approach  to  health-health  tradeoffs;  this
first  approximation  is  an  effort  to  limit  aggregate  risks  under-
stood  in "expected  value" terms.  I then  suggest  that this  approx-
imation  must  be  qualified  by  reference  to  some  complexities  in
ordinary  citizen  judgments  about  risk.  People  care  not  simply
about  how  many  lives  are  saved,  but  also  about  whether  risks
are  involuntarily  incurred,  especially  dreaded,  inequitably  dis-
tributed,  potentially  catastrophic,  faced  by the  current  or by  fu-
ture  generations,  and  so  forth.  Reflective  judgments  of this  sort
diverge  from  both  expert  and  economic  valuations,  though  in
interestingly  different  ways.  These  reflective  judgments  bear  a
great deal  on how we  think about the  "rationality" of risk regula-

tion.  They  also  have  consequences  for  the  pervasive  issue  of
incommensurability  in law.

Part  IV  deals  with  existing  law,  urging  agencies  to  under-
take  more  health-health  tradeoffs  than  they now do, and  explain-
ing  how  a  judicial  role  could  encourage  this  to  happen.  Part  V
deals  with  how  Congress  and  the  President  might  approach
health-health  tradeoffs  in  a  way  that  diminishes  the  problems
associated  both  with the  "pollution of the  month"  syndrome  and
with  myopia or selective  attention.

II.  A POLEMICAL  NOTE  AND  A  CONCEPTUAL  MAP

Discussions  of  the  administrative  state-and  proposals  for
improving  it-fall  into  two  general  categories.  Most  familiar  is
the traditional  lawyers'  approach,  reflected  in the Administrative
Procedure  Act  and  in  much  of conventional  administrative  law.
Here  we  find  a range  of efforts  to limit  administrative  discretion,
mostly through  procedural  requirements  and judicial  review.  On
this  view,  the  basic  problem  for  the  administrative  state  is  the
exercise of policy-making  discretion by unelected bureaucrats;  the
basic  solution  is to reduce  this discretionary  authority."

The  second  approach  is concerned  with improving regulatory
performance  by  asking  concrete  questions  about  the  effects  of
regulation.2 7  On  this  view,  administrative  discretion  is  a  prob-
lem  only  to  the  extent  that  administrative  discretion  produces
bad  outcomes.2 8  And  on  this  view,  administrative  law  doctrines,
and  reform  proposals  for  the  administrative  state,  should  be
founded  on  a  concrete  understanding  of  what  strategies  will
make  regulation  work better by, for  example,  saving  or lengthen-
ing lives,  reducing  cost,  increasing  employment,  and  improving
education.

In  my view,  lawyers  have  focused  far  too  much  and  far  too
long  on  the control  of administrative  discretion,  and  far too  little
on  the  actual  effects  of administrative  behavior  on  social  well-

26 This approach  sees  the fall of the nondelegation  doctrine  as  the basic  problem  and
attempts  to  provide  surrogates  for  that  doctrine.  See,  for  example,  David  Schoenbrod,
Power Without Responsibility: How Congress Abuses the People Through Delegation 155-91
(Yale  1994).

'  See, for example,  Breyer, Breaking the Vicious  Circle at 9-10 (cited in note 9); Jerry
L. Mashaw,  Bureaucratic Justice 79 (Yale  1983);  Viscusi, Fatal Tradeoffs at 149-50  (cited
in note  15).

'  See  Jerry L. Mashaw,  Why Administrators Should Make Political Decisions, 1 J L
Econ  & Org  81 (1985)  (arguing that administrative  discretion is likely to improve  regula-
tory  performance).

being.  For  the  future  a  critical  question  is  the  relationship  be-
tween  administrative  law  doctrines  and  those  effects.  If,  for  ex-
ample,  administrative  discretion  is  in some  domain likely  to lead
to  better  outcomes  than  legislative  discretion-as  is  certainly
imaginable  in  technically  complex  areas,  especially  those  involv-
ing  the  choice  of  means  for  achieving  given  ends-then  there
ought  to  be  at  least  a  presumption  in  favor  of  administrative
discretion.  Traditional  lawyers  might  be  tempted  to  reject  such
discretion  by  reference  to  large-sounding  abstractions  involving,
for  example,  legitimacy,  Marbury  v  Madison,2 9  or  checks  and
balances.  But  if  an  administrative  law  doctrine-involving,  for
example,  judicial  deference  to  administrative  interpretations  of
law  ---is likely  to  reduce  overall costs  and  increase  the  rational-
ity  of regulatory  law, there is  a good  argument for that  doctrine.
As the twenty-first century  approaches,  it  is, in  short, appro-
priate  for  administrative  law  to  focus  less  on  large-sounding
abstractions,  usually  rooted  in  a  controversial  understanding  of
the  Constitution,  and  more  on  questions  that  are  at  once  more
concrete,  more  empirical,  more  manageable,  and  more  directed
toward  real-world consequences.  And though I cannot support the
point  here,  I  believe  that  such  a  shift  would  point  toward  new
ways  of  approaching  a host  of old  questions.3'  Let  us  turn, then,
to the important and pervasive  issue of health-health  tradeoffs  as
a case  in  point, and  see how  administrative  law might be revised
to  deal with that issue.

A.  Regulated  and Ancillary Risks

To get a handle on the problem  of health-health  tradeoffs,  we
need to make  some distinctions.  Call the risks that government  is
trying  to  control  the  regulated risks. Call  the  risks  that  are  in-
creased  by regulation  the ancillary risks.3 2

Ancillary risks take many different forms,  depending on their
relationship  to  the  regulated  risk.  We  might  say,  for  example,
that  the  increase  in  acid  deposition  is  not  within the  same  do-

2  5  US  (1  Cranch) 137  (1803).

See, for example,  Chevron v NRDC, 467 US  837,  842-45  (1984).

31  For example,  the issue  of scope  of judicial  review  might  be  examined  largely  by
asking  about what  kind  of approach  will reduce  both costs  of decision  and  costs  of error.
Chevron  itself  could  be  examined  under  this  rubric.  The  much  debated  line  between
Londoner v  Denver, 210  US  373  (1908),  and  Bi-Metallic Investment Co.  v  State Board of
Equalization, 239  US  441  (1915),  could be  understood in similar terms.

Compare  this with  the discussion  of target risks  and  countervailing  risks in  Gra-

ham and Wiener,  Confronting Risk Tradeoffs at 1-2  (cited in note  13).

main  as  the  risks  prevented  by  regulation  of  nuclear  power
plants. This  is true in two  different  ways, legal  and factual.  First,
and  for  many  purposes  most  importantly,  the  law  does  not  con-
sider them  in the  same  domain.  The agency that regulates  one  of
these risks, the Environmental  Protection Agency ("EPA"),  has no
authority to regulate  the  other, which falls  under  the jurisdiction
of  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  ("NRC").  A  pervasive
problem  in handling health-health  tradeoffs  stems  from organiza-
tion charts  that allocate  authority  to  diverse  agencies,  frequently
in ways that make it  difficult or impossible  for  agencies  to coordi-
nate their responses.3 3

Second,  the  risks  of acid  deposition  (mostly  from  coal-fired
power  plants)  have  a  different  source  from  the  risks  created  by
nuclear  power  plants  as  a simple  matter  of fact.  This  point  sug-
gests  that  health-health  tradeoffs  will  often  require  agencies  to
compile  extensive  information,  possibly  in a way  that  will  dwarf
existing  capacities.  Compare  a  situation  in  which  the  regulation
of sulfur  dioxide  emissions  increases  carbon  monoxide  emissions.
If  this  happens,  we  are  dealing  in  any  event  with  air  pollution,
indeed  air pollution  from  largely  the  same  technologies,  and the
EPA has the statutory  authority to regulate  both sources.

It  is  therefore  possible  to  imagine  a  complex  continuum  of
relationships  between  regulated  risks  and  ancillary  risks.  There
are,  of course,  differences  among  risks--differences  of  degree  as
well  as  differences  in  kind-especially  in  the  factual  domain,
where  there  may  or may  not  be  an  element  of overlap  between
relevant  inquiries. And,  of course,  we  might  describe  the  domain
of the regulated  risk in  many  different  ways.  For  some  purposes
the  best  way  to  define  the  risk  domain  is  through  the  relevant
law, which,  as  we  will  see,  sets  constraints  on  the  kinds  of risk
that agencies  may  consider.

A  well-functioning  administrative  state  would  seek  a  mea-
sure  of coordination  among agencies,  so  that an agency  operating
in  one  domain  does  not  inadvertently  or  unnecessarily  increase
risks in other domains;  and so  that risk assessments  are  made  as
globally  as  possible.  As  a  threshold  matter,  agencies  should  at
the very least coordinate  their efforts  so  as to  reduce  net or  over-
all  risks. But  a  special  problem  for  coordinated  responses  is that
agencies  have  quite  different  standards  for  deciding  when  risks
require  regulation.3 4  The  International  Commission  on  Radiolog-

Health-Health Tradeoffs

1541

ical  Protection,  for  example,  recommends  that  environmental
factors  should  not  cause  an  incremental  cancer  risk,  for  those
exposed  over  a  lifetime,  of  more  than  about  three  in  one  thou-
sand.35  But  American  agencies  do  not  follow  this  recommenda-
tion.  Indeed,  their  practices  vary  widely.  The  NRC  sees  one  in
one  thousand  as  acceptable;  the  EPA's  acceptable  range  varies
from  one  in  ten thousand  to  one  in  one  million."  The  Food  and
Drug  Administration  ("FDA") has  tried to  use  a standard  of one
in  one  million,  but under  the  Delaney  Clause,37  courts  have  re-
quired  a standard  of essentially  zero.38  The  Occupational  Safety
and Health Administration  ("OSHA")  has interpreted the "signifi-
cant  risk" requirement  found  in its  governing  statute  to  mean  a
risk  of one  in  one  thousand;  labor  groups  have  sought  a change
to one in one million.39

These  varying  standards  make  performing  health-health
tradeoffs  a very  complex  matter.  If one  agency  is  using  a  stan-
dard  of one  in  one  thousand  for  risk  A,  and  doing  so  lawfully,
how  should  it  deal  with  an increase  in  risk B,  when  that risk is
regulated  by  a  different  agency  operating  lawfully  under  a  dif-
ferent standard?  Matters  become  even  more  complex  when  risks
from cancer  are being  compared  with other sorts  of risk.

I  do  not  urge  that  judgments  about  significance  must  be
uniform.  Contextual  differences  justify different judgments  about
which  risks  warrant  special  concern.'  But  such  judgments
should  be  made  in  a  self-conscious  and  informed  way,  rather
than on an ad hoc  basis. I return to  this issue below.

There  are  many  different  mechanisms  by  which  risk regula-
tion  may  increase  aggregate  risks.4'  All  of  these  mechanisms
have  a degree  of complexity,  and  hence  collective judgments  that
respond  to them may well misfire.  Consider  the following:

-A 

regulatory  ban  may  result  in  independent  health  risks
coming  from  ancillary  "replacement" risks.  If  we  ban  substance

A, the  replacement  substance  B  may  also  be  dangerous.  If a car-
cinogenic  substance  is  regulated,  perhaps  people  will use  a prod-
uct that is not  carcinogenic  but that causes  serious risks  of heart
disease.

-Regulation  may produce  a new, offsetting risk that is qual-
itatively  similar  to  or  indistinguishable  from  the  target  risk.
Perhaps  regulation  of certain  substances  that threaten to  destroy
the  ozone  layer  will  produce  new  reliance  on  other  substances
that  also threaten the  ozone layer.

-Regulation  may  force  society  to  forego  "opportunity  bene-
fits."  For  example,  the  careful  screening  procedures  that  keep
drugs  and  services  from  prematurely  entering  the  marketplace
may  also  deprive  people  of certain health benefits.  This  problem
has  received  recent  attention  with respect to  the Food  and  Drug
Administration,  especially  with  the  "drug lag"  and  the  agency's
efforts  to  control the spread  of AIDS.42

-Regulated  substances  may  create health benefits  as well  as
health  risks.  By  eliminating  those  health  benefits,  regulation
may  therefore  create  a net increase  in health dangers.

-Regulation  of one risk may  protect  a  certain  group  of peo-
ple  while  imposing  a  new  risk  on  another  group.  This  would
happen,  for example,  if a ban  on a certain  pesticide  protects  con-
sumers,  plants,  and  animals,  but  simultaneously  increases  risks
to  farmers.  Perhaps  regulations  protecting  men  from  certain
risks  will impose  new risks  on  women.

-Most  generally,  the  economic  costs  imposed  by  regulation

may  create health risks,  as  I discuss  below  in Part II.B.
When  officials  think  about  health-health 

tradeoffs,  the
distributional  incidence  of the  ancillary  risk may  matter  a great
deal  for policy  purposes.  Sometimes  the ancillary risk falls  on the
same  class  of  people  as  the  regulated  risk;  sometimes  the  ancil-
lary  risk burdens  an  entirely  different  group.  This  suggests  that
risk redistribution, rather than  risk reduction,  is  a possible  goal
and  outcome of regulation. Interest groups may well try to exploit
this  possibility.  Hence  it  should  be  expected  that  odd  coalitions
will  develop  to  reduce  risks  of a  certain  kind when  the  result  is
to  shift risks  (and control  costs)  from some  groups  to others.'

B.  "Richer Is Safer"

Thus  far  we  have  been  discussing  cases  in  which  the  act  of
regulating  one  risk  produces  ancillary  risks  through  a  certain
causal  chain.  There  is  a  particularly  controversial  possibility
here,  one that has been  receiving  much  recent attention.  Regula-
tions  cost money-sometimes  a great  deal  of money-and  private
expenditures  on  regulatory compliance  may  produce  less  employ-
ment and more poverty.  People who  are unemployed  or poor  tend
to  be  in worse  health  and  to  live  shorter  lives."  If wealthy  peo-
ple face  diminished  threats  to  life  and health,  and  if poor  people
face  greater  threats,  might  not  costly  regulation  increase  risks
simply by virtue of reducing wealth?

There  are several  reasons  why this might be  so.'  First, peo-
ple  with more  wealth  have  more  capacity  to  spend their  income
on  health-enhancing  goods  and  activities.  There  is  strong  evi-
dence  to  this  effect;  for  example,  poor  people  have  inferior  hous-
ing and  a lower  rate of smoke  detector installment,  and  this may
well  be  connected  with  greater  death  rates  from  fire."  Second,
people  who  are  poorer also  suffer  from various  stresses  that  may
have  adverse  health  effects.  Stress  itself  can  contribute  to  mor-
bidity  and  mortality;  it  can,  for  example,  lead  to  an  increase  in
heart disease. Finally, greater  social wealth  seems to be  associat-
ed  with  more  general  social  changes  in  the  direction  of greater
safety, though the relevant  mechanism  is not  well understood.

This possibility  has  been  reflected  in legal  opinions,  perhaps
most prominently  in Judge  Easterbrook's  suggestion  that  a fetal
protection  policy  might  "reduce  risk  attributable  to  lead  at  the
cost  of  increasing  other  hazards,"  including  the  hazards  stem-
ming  from  less  income,  since  "there  is  also  a  powerful  link  be-
tween  the  parents'  income  and  infants'  health."47  The  more  gen-

The Role of Health-Health Analysis, 22  Ecol L Q  729 (1995).  See  also the  discussion of the
connection between income and longevity in  Jean Drbze  and Amartya  Sen, India: Econom-
ic Development  and Social  Opportunity 59-61,  207-10  (Clarendon  1995).  Dr~ze  and  Sen
show  that  per  capita  income  is  linked  with  longevity  but  also  that  fair  distribution  is
important, since a  high per capita income  that coexists  with large  pockets  of poverty may
be  accompanied  by  high  mortality  rates.  Cross  correctly  emphasizes  the  importance  of
distributional  considerations  and  hence  the  connection  between  health-health  analysis
and environmental  justice. See  Cross,  22 Ecol L Q  at 762-64,  782-83.

eral question is this: Would it be possible  to make precise  connec-
tions  between  governmentally  required  expenditures  on  risk
reduction  with shifts  in unemployment  and poverty?

An incipient  literature  attempts  to  do  precisely  this. A  1990
study  attempted  to  develop  a  model  to  quantify  the  view  that
"richer  is  safer."'  According  to  Ralph  Keeney,  a  single  fatality
might result from a compulsory  expenditure  of from  $6.49 million
to  $7.25  million;  with  different  assumptions  about 
the
distributional  incidence  of  the  costs,  the  estimate  could  range
between  $3  million and  $12  million.49  In  a concurring  opinion  in
a  1991  case  involving  occupational  safety  and  health regulation,
Judge  Williams  invoked  this  evidence  to  suggest  that  OSHA's
refusal  to  engage  in  cost-benefit  analysis  might  not be  beneficial
for  workers."  Judge  Williams  reasoned  in  the  following  way.  If
a fatality  results from  an  expenditure  of $7.5  million,  then some
regulations  might  produce  more  fatalities  than  they  prevent.
Many  regulations  of  course  cost  more  than  $7.5  million  per  life
saved.  In Judge Williams's  view,  an agency that fails  to measure
costs  against  benefits  might be failing to  measure  mortality gains
against  losses.

The  claimed  relationship  between  wealth  reductions  and
mortality  is  controversial,5'  but  a  number  of studies  have  found
such  a relationship.  There  is  a growing  consensus,  from  diverse
studies,  that  regulatory  expenditures  can  increase  mortality.

This  point  leads  to  a broader  one  with  considerable  implications
for  law.  Even  if agencies  are  sometimes  prevented,  by  law,  from
measuring  costs  against  benefits,5 3  perhaps  they  can  compare
health  losses  with  health  gains,  and  conclude  that  some  regula-
tions  are not worthwhile because  they cost lives  in the aggregate.
In  fact  it  can  be  shown  that  some  regulations  fail  health-health
analysis  whether  or  not they pass  cost-benefit  analysis.  Thus  we
might  be  able  to  agree  that  such  regulations  are  counterproduc-

The  idea  that  "richer  is  safer"  has  started  to  affect  public
deliberations  about  risk.  In  a  now  celebrated  letter  written  in
1992, James  MacRae,  the Acting Administrator of OIRA,  wrote to
the Department  of Labor  questioning a proposed regulation  of air
contaminants  in  the  workplace.5 5  OSHA  had  estimated  savings
of between  eight and thirteen  lives  per year,  at an  annual  cost of
$163  million.  MacRae  suggested  that  there was  a significant  gap
in OSHA's  analysis:  If  a  statistical fatality  is produced  by an  ex-
penditure  of  $7.5  million,  the  regulation  could  actually  cause

twenty-two  additional  deaths.  MacRae  asked  OSHA  to  investi-
gate  the  relation  between  health,  wealth,  and  safety.  OSHA  re-
sponded  that  existing  data  to  the  effect  that  "richer  is  safer"
seemed  highly  speculative,  but  it  did  call  for  more  comments
from the public."6

Eventually,  a public  outcry  forced  OIRA  to  retreat.  Senator
Glenn  in  particular  complained  of OIRA's  "Alice-in-Wonderland
type  claim  that  health  and  safety  regulations  cause  harm  to
workers"  and  objected  that  the  "richer is  safer"  view  "seems  to
stand  logic  on  its head-to  say  that  controlling  a dangerous  sub-
stance in the workplace  makes  an increased  health hazard  to the
worker.""7  Despite  the  public  outcry,  further  research  on  the  is-
sue  suggests  that lives  can  indeed be  lost through required  regu-
latory  expenditures. At  a minimum  government  ought to consider
the  problem seriously.

If  officials  are  to  consider  the fact  that  "richer is  safer,"  it  is
important  to  know  whether  the  burdens  of  regulation  fall  on
those  who  are  poor  and  near poor  or those  who  are rich.  Simple
intuition  suggests that  a loss  in  income  from relatively  poor  peo-
ple  will have  more  severe  health  effects  than  a similar  loss from
the  relatively  well  off. A recent  study  confirms  the  intuition."  It
suggests  that  when  program  costs  are  borne  exclusively  by  the
richest 20 percent of the population,  mortality effects  are  one-half
as high as when program  costs  are  borne exclusively  by the poor-
est  20  percent  of the  nation.5 9  Thus  it  is  necessary  to  know  the
distributional  incidence  of  costs  in  order  to  see  the  extent  to
which  "richer is  safer."

C.  Why Does  It  Matter?

We  have  now  seen  enough  to  know that  an impressive  body
of  work  attempts  to  measure  health  gains  from  regulation
against health risks from regulation.  But why  should we  focus  on
this  particular  question?  Would  it  not  be  better  to  attend  to  the
overall  gains  from  regulation  and  to  the  overall  losses  from  reg-

ulation?  Cost-benefit  analysis  is  receiving  considerable  attention
in  both  agencies 0  and  Congress,6  and  cost-benefit  analysis,
properly  conceived,  takes  account  of all  of the  health-related  ef-
fects  of regulation.  Health-health  assessments  focus  on  a subset
of effects,  and  refuse  to  translate  those  effects  into  dollars.  Such
assessments  ignore  all  costs unrelated  to  mortality  and  morbidi-
ty. But what is special  about health-health  tradeoffs?  Why should
analysis  focus  on  such  tradeoffs  rather  than  on  all  relevant  ef-
fects?

Part  of the answer lies in existing public judgments,  taken as
simple  brute facts.  People  seem  to think that regulation  is bad  if
it  causes  more  deaths  than  it  prevents;  a  demonstration  that  a
particular  regulation  has  this effect  would count  strongly against
its  adoption.  But  people  do  not  always  know  how  to  compare
health  gains  (fifteen  lives  gained,  for  example)  with  monetary
losses  (an  expenditure  of  $15  million,  for  example).  This  uncer-
tainty  stems  partly  from  the  fact  that  lives  and  dollars  are  not
easily  made  commensurable,6 2  and  partly  from  the  fact  that the
appropriate  amount  to  spend  on  protection  of a  (statistical) life
depends  very much on context.

A  deliberative  judgment  about  how  to  assess  net  health
tradeoffs  is  easier  to  reach  than  a  deliberative  judgment  about
how  to  assess  cost-benefit  tradeoffs.  It  may  thus  be  possible  to
obtain  an  incompletely  theorized  agreement 6 3-- incompletely  the-
orized  in the  sense  that  people  from  diverse  theoretical  perspec-
tives  can  agree-that  a  net  mortality  loss  is  bad.  Incompletely
theorized  agreements  on particular results  are  an important  part
of  democratic  deliberation;  they  are  a  distinctive  solution  to  the
problems  of social  pluralism and disagreement.

See, for example,  Exec Order  No 12866,  3  CFR at 638  (cited in  note  5).

61  See  Sunstein,  48  Stan L Rev  at  269-86 (cited in  note  7).  For a valuable  overview,

see  Hahn,  Regulatory Reform  (cited  in  note  11)  (finding that  about  half of government
regulations  since  1990 would not pass a cost-benefit  test).

'  I am  therefore  rejecting the suggestion  in Graham  and  Wiener that the  problem of
incommensurability  stems from current  methods  of comparison:  'iI]t is  chiefly our lack  of
methods  of comparison-of  ways  of seeing  commonality  among  these  risks-that  makes
these  risks  seem  'dissimilar'  or  noncomparable,  not  an inherent  incommensurability.  As
we improve  methods  of risk  analysis,  the  idea of calculating the  'net risk' of a risk  portfo-
lio,  or the  change  in  net risk  due  to  a  risk tradeoff, may  become  more meaningful."  Con-
fronting Risk Tradeoffs at  33 (cited in  note  13).  The problem  of incommensurability  stems
not  from  a  lack  of methods  of  comparison,  but  from  human  perceptions  of  qualitative
differences  among diverse risks. Moreover,  incommensurability need  not be identified with
incomparability.

It  would, however, be inadequate  for present purposes  to rely
on  existing  public  judgments,  which  may  be  irrational  or  con-
fused.  Perhaps  public  uncertainty  about  cost-benefit  judgments
depends  on an  obstinate  and  counterproductive  unwillingness  to
acknowledge  that  even  (risk to)  life  has  its  price  and  that  risks
are  matters of degree  rather  than "dangerous  or not."'

But  part  of the  answer  can  be  found  in  information  costs.
The  comparative  defect  of  health-health  assessment  is  also  its
virtue:  it  involves  only a subset of the consequences  of regulating.
Fewer facts  need  to be  compiled.  The  assessment  may  economize
on  the  costs  of  inquiry  into  speculative  issues  about  regulatory
consequences.

Another  part of the answer  may lie in  attending more  closely
to  problems  of  incommensurability.  We  might  understand
incommensurability  to  arise when no  single metric is available  by
which  to  assess  the  variables  at  stake  in  a  social  decision.65  In
the area  of risk regulation,  a single metric  is  troublesome  simply
because  it  blurs  qualitative  distinctions.  The  vice  and  virtue  of
cost-benefit  analysis  is that  it  attempts  to  provide  such  a metric.
If  all  effects  are  reduced  to  the  metric  of  dollars,  it  may  be  pos-
sible  to  make  simple  assessments,  in  the  sense  that comparisons
and hence  tradeoffs  can  become  easier. But the reduction  of mor-
tality and  morbidity  effects  to  dollars  can  erase  important  quali-
tative  distinctions  among diverse risks.  These  qualitative  distinc-
tions matter,  and hence it  is important for officials  to understand
them when they make  decisions.

It  is  in  the  face  of  qualitative  distinctions-distinctions  in
how, not  simply  how much, things  are  valued-that  participants
in democratic  deliberation  often  resist a metric  of dollars.  To  say
this  is  not  to  say  that  there  is  a  problem  of incomparability  or
that  tradeoffs  do  not  have  to  be  made  among  qualitatively  di-
verse  goods.  But  perhaps  people  can  make  choices  more  easily
when  the  tradeoffs  involve  things  that  may  seem  qualitatively
indistinguishable,  like  lives,  rather  than  qualitatively  diverse
things,  like  lives  and  dollars.  Most  simply,  when  it  is  hard  to
trade  off lives  against  dollars,  the burdens  of judgment  might be
eased  when we  are  trading  off lives  against  lives. A judgment  of

this  kind  undoubtedly  underlies  the  interest  in  health-health
analysis.

There  is  considerable  truth to  this  suggestion.  But it is a bit
too  crude. As  we  shall see,  lives are themselves  not  commensura-
ble, in the  sense that  a single  metric--lives  saved"-is  itself too
coarse-grained  to  account  for people's  considered judgments.  We
do  not  reason  well  if we  think  that  two  lives  should  always  be
traded  for, say, two and  a half lives.  A great deal  depends  on the
context  in  which  those  statistical  lives  are  put  at  risk  (and  on
what  those  lives  would  be  like).66  For  this  reason  problems  of
incommensurability  cannot  be  eliminated  so  easily.  They  play  a
large role  in health-health  comparisons  too.

What  solutions  are  possible?  It  may  be  possible  to  reduce
these  problems by looking  not  at total  lives lost  or gained,  but at
the  effects  of regulation  on  the  number  of  quality-adjusted  life
years."  A  regulation  that  saves  thirteen  children  while  jeopar-
dizing  fifteen  elderly  people  may  well  be  worthwhile,  at least  if
the thirteen  children are likely to have  decent life prospects.  Gov-
ernment  might thus focus  on statistical  years  rather than statis-
tical  lives.  Through  attending  to  years  rather  than  lives  saved,
and  also  by making judgments  about the  nature  of years  saved,
problems  of incommensurability  can  be reduced  though  certainly
not eliminated.

III.  INCORPORATING  HEALTH-HEALTH  COMPARISONS

A.  First Approximation

Let  us  try, in  a simple,  intuitive  way, to  identify the  factors
that should  enter into deliberative judgments  about health-health
tradeoffs.  Begin with a simple  case  in which  the costs  of informa-
tion and inquiry are zero.  If this is so, all agencies  should investi-
gate  all  risks  potentially  at  stake.  Agencies  should  always  take
account of ancillary risks and  always try to limit overall or aggre-
gate risks.

Of  course  the  costs  of  investigation  and  inquiry  are  never
zero;  to  the  contrary,  they  are  often  very  high.  We  can  readily
imagine  that  agencies  could  spend  all  their  time  investigating
ancillary risks  and  never do anything  else-a disaster for regula-
tory  policy.68  (This is  a  potential  problem  with  cost-benefit  anal-

ysis:  cost-benefit  analysis  may  itself fail  cost-benefit  analysis-if
the  costs  of undertaking  cost-benefit  analysis  are  high  and  the
benefits  lower.)  When  the  costs  of inquiry  are  not  zero,  the  obli-
gation to inquire into  ancillary risks  might be a function of sever-
al factors. First is  the cost  of delay,  understood  as  the  cost of not
controlling  the  regulated  risk  until  more  information  has  been
compiled.  To  assess  this  cost,  it  is  necessary  to  explore  the  seri-
ousness  of the regulated  risk and the  length  of time  necessary  to
investigate  the  ancillary  risk. Second is  the  cost  of investigating
the  ancillary  risk,  where  this  cost is  understood  as  a  product  of
the  cost  of  compiling  and  evaluating  the  relevant  information.
Third is  the  benefit  of  investigating  the  ancillary  risk,  with  the
benefit  understood  as  the  likelihood  of  uncovering  information
that might  help to  produce  a different  and better result.

Under this view, it  is of course  (and unfortunately) important
to know  at least  something  about the possible  extent of the ancil-
lary risk and the  costs  of discovering  it.  Hence there  is a  problem
of  circularity:  it  is  impossible  to  know  whether  to  undertake
health-health  analysis  without  first  doing  a bit  of health-health
analysis,  at  least  by  making  some  initial  judgments  about  the
ancillary  risk-a risk that, by hypothesis,  the  agency has  not yet
explored.  Before  the  actual  investigation  has  occurred,  there  will
be  a good deal  of intuition and guesswork;  the full facts cannot  be
known until inquiries  have been completed,  and the real  question
is  whether  it  is  worthwhile  to  complete  the  inquiries  or  even  to
embark on them.6 9

But  even  at  an  early  stage,  it  is  possible  to  know that  some
ancillary  risks  are  likely to  be high,  while  others  are  likely  to be
trivial  or low.  Moreover,  some  ancillary  risks  can be investigated
at low cost, while  others depend  on  scientific  and predictive judg-
ments  that  require  enormous  investments  of time and  resources.
There  is  an  analogy  here  to  the  question  of whether  and  when
agencies  must  explore  alternatives  under  either  the  National
Environmental  Policy Act or  the APA. Here  courts have indicated
that some,  but not all,  alternatives  must be investigated,  and the
outcome  turns  on  considerations  like  those  I  have  been  discuss-
ing."°  Of  course,  an  agency  might  be  reluctant  to  inquire  into

ancillary  risks  on  the  theory  that, if it does  so,  it will  be  unable
to regulate the risk at issue within a reasonable  period  of time. It
seems  clear  that the extent  and nature  of the  regulated  risk  are
crucial  factors  for  those  deciding  whether  to  explore  ancillary
risks.

On this simple, intuitive  view, an agency might reason in the
following way:  If it would be  enormously expensive  to  investigate
whether  fuel  economy  standards  would  really  produce  smaller
and  more  dangerous  cars,  if  the  fuel  economy  standards  would
themselves  do  a lot of good,  and if the likelihood  of a high  ancil-
lary  risk seems  small,  then  it  makes  sense  to  proceed  with  the
fuel  economy  standards  without  investigating  ancillary  risks."
On the other hand, it is easy to  imagine  scenarios  in which inves-
tigation  of ancillary  risks  would  be reasonable  and the  failure  to
investigate  would  be  irrational.  Thus,  the  National  Highway
Transportation  Safety  Administration's  ("NHTSA")  actual  posi-
tion with respect  to fuel economy standards  and safety is that the
ancillary risk is worth investigating. 2

Compare  the  question  of how to  handle  ancillary risks  creat-
ed  by the  prohibited manufacture  of asbestos.  One  ancillary risk
arises  because  asbestos  appears  to  be  the  safest  and  thus  best
product  for  use  in brake  linings.  Whether  this  is  true,  and  how
serious  the  ancillary  risk is,  can  be  investigated  at  the  present
time.  But  other  ancillary  risks  involve  the  eventual  substitutes
for  asbestos  in  products  for  which  no  substitutes  are  now
available.  On  the view  of the EPA,  the ban  on asbestos  will force
technological  innovation,  producing  new  substances  that  do  the
work  now  done  by  asbestos."  This  may be  a  reasonable  though
speculative  view.  If so,  the  government  has  reason  to  regulate
asbestos  now  and  to  wait  before  evaluating  the  risks  posed  by
substitutes.

B.  Existing Law  and its Rationale

How  should  we  understand  existing  law  in light of this  first
approximation?  Congress  has  apparently forbidden  health-health
analysis  in  many  settings  by  directing  agencies  to  focus  on  cer-

71  Compare  this,  however, with the  EPA's  position  in Corrosion Proof Fittings v EPA,

947 F2d 1201,  1220 (5th Cir  1991) (proceeding with a ban on asbestos  despite the  possibil-
ity  of  ancillary  risk  from  substitutes  on  the  theory  that  new  substitutes  will  develop
because  of the  ban). See also note  73 and  accompanying  text.

tain  health  problems  to  the  exclusion  of  all  others.74  Questions
naturally  arise  about  what  understanding,  if  any,  accounts  for
these prohibitions.

Some  of the  relevant  statutes  might be  seen  to  reflect  cate-
gorical, rule-bound judgments reflecting  factors  of the  kind just
discussed.  Congress  might  think,  for  example,  that  the  NRC
should  not  ask whether  regulation  of nuclear  power  will  cause  a
shift to coal-fired  power plants  and thus  aggravate the problem of
acid  deposition  (a) because  the  problem  of unsafe  nuclear power
is an  especially urgent  one  and  (b) because  it would be  very hard
for the  NRC,  given its limited budget  and  expertise,  to  make the
necessary  extrapolations.  Under  the  considerations  I  have  dis-
cussed,  Congress  might plausibly exempt  the NRC  from the  duty
of exploring  ancillary risks, or even ban it from doing  so.

Alternatively,  the problems posed by ancillary risks might be
solved by a healthy division of labor. The problems  posed by coal-
fired  power  plants  are  the  EPA's  responsibility.  Any  effects  on
automobile  safety that come  from air pollution regulation  produc-
ing smaller  cars might be controlled  by NHTSA.  Perhaps NHTSA
has  the  authority to  make  sure  that  the  ancillary  risk  does  not
come  to  fruition.  Perhaps  the  two  agencies  will  coordinate  their
efforts  to  ensure  that aggregate  risks  are minimized.  Or  consider
the  health  risks  from  regulation  inducing  unemployment  and
poverty.  It  might  be  thought  that  these  adverse  effects  are  or
should  be  addressed  by  other  governmental  institutions,  includ-
ing those  entrusted  with the power to  reduce unemployment  and
poverty.

Of  course  there  are  serious  problems  with  the  division-of-
labor  strategy.  Coordination  of  risk  regulation  is  difficult  to
achieve,  and  in  modern  government,  it has  not  been  pursued  in
any  systematic  way.7"  In  any  case  it  would  be  extravagant  to
suggest  that  a  healthy  division  of  labor  accounts  for  existing
practice.  If there  were  such  a  division  of labor,  agencies  would
systematically  respond  to  increases  in  ancillary  risk  created  by
other agencies;  but there  is no  evidence  of such  responses.

7'  See  note 53  and accompanying  text.
75  However,  some  efforts  at  coordination  are  prescribed  in Exec  Order  No  12866,  3
CFR at 638  (cited in  note  5). For example,  §  1(bX10)  directs  agencies to  "avoid  regulations
that  are  inconsistent,  incompatible,  or  duplicative  with  its  other regulations  or  those  of
other Federal Agencies."  Id at 640.  Similarly, § 2(b)  emphasizes  that the Office  of Manage-
ment  and Budget  ("OMB")  is  to  review and  coordinate  all  agency  rulemaking,  in  part to
ensure "that  regulations...  do not  conflict  with  the  policies  or actions  taken  or planned
by  another agency." Id.

Another  explanation  for  why  existing  law  makes  relevant
some  risks  but not  others  points  to the  important  role  of interest
groups in the  regulatory  process.7 6  On  this  view,  selective  atten-
tion  and  disparities  in  regulatory  strategies  are  attributable  to
the  fact  that well  organized  groups  are  able  to  obtain  legislation
in  their  interests  and  to fend  off regulation  that would  be harm-
ful to  their  interests.  It  should  be  unsurprising  that  the  statute
regulating  agricultural  practices  allows  for a form  of open-ended
balancing;"  the  agricultural  groups  are  in  a  good  position  to
fend  off draconian  legislation.  Some  environmental  groups  work
very hard  to  obtain  severe  restrictions  on  carcinogenic  substanc-
es. 78

In fact,  interest  groups  might  work  together  so  as  to  redis-
tribute risks, and the resulting coalitions might well ban agencies
from  engaging  in health-health  analysis  for  fear  that  the  result
will  be  decreased  redistribution.  If,  for  example,  corn  producers
attempt  to  obtain  an  ethanol  requirement  for gasoline,  they  will
not be disturbed to find that ethanol itself imposes  environmental
risks.  Or if  it  happens  that electric  cars  produce  environmental
hazards  because  of waste  disposal  problems,  the redistribution  of
the  risk  may  not be  bothersome  to  those  who  favor  electric  cars
on self-interested  grounds.  It  would  even  be  possible  to  imagine
cases in  which  the redistributed risk was  affirmatively  sought, if,
for  example,  those  who  face  the  new  risk  are  competitors.  Un-
doubtedly,  an investigation  of the  political  economy  of risk regu-
lation  would reveal  many diverse  cases  in  which interest  groups
pursue  their  own  interests rather  than  overall risk reduction. 79

Other explanations  would point to myopia, selective attention,
sensationalism, loss aversion, credit-claiming, and random agen-
da  selection.0   Some  statutes  stem 
from  sensationalistic
events-the  Love  Canal  scare  is  one  example  of  this  tenden-
cy-that  encourage  legislators  to  hold hearings,  enact  legislation,
and  claim credit for fixing problems that  are  either not very large

risk...  taking into account  the  economic,  social, and  environmental  costs  and benefits  of
the use  of any pesticide." 7  USC  § 136(bb)  (1994).

or  that  are  just  a  part  of  a  complex  whole.  Such  statutes  are
likely  to  reflect  myopia  or  selective  attention.8'  The  result  may
well  be  a  form  of  random  agenda  selection  that  bans  health-
health  tradeoffs,  that  does  not  adequately  reduce  risks,  or  that
even  increases  some  risks.  Moreover,  people  are  pervasively
averse  to  losses  from  the  status  quo-more  so  than  they  are  fa-
vorably  inclined  to  improvements  from  the  status  quo--and  loss
aversion  may  account  for  apparently  irrational judgments  about
how to trade  off health risks.

Finally, some  statutes  might  reflect public judgments  about
how  to  conduct  health-health  tradeoffs.  Perhaps  the  public  be-
lieves that an increase  in a certain risk is not a relevant  factor in
the assessment  of another  risk. This  could be  a product  of simple
confusion,  as in the  well-established  refusal,  on the part  of some
of  the  public  some  of  the  time,  to  acknowledge  any  need  for
tradeoffs.'  Such  judgments  should  not  be  given  any  weight  in
law.  Nevertheless,  Congress,  responsive  as  it  is  to  the  wishes  of
the  electorate,  appears  to disagree  with this proposition.  Or pub-
lic judgments  might  be based  on  heuristics  of certain kinds,  pro-
ductive  of  errors,"  or  on  gripping  anecdotes  that  make  draconi-
an  regulation  of  a  certain  risk  seem  quite  sensible.  In  these
ways,  public  judgments  could  be  confused;  we  might  prefer  a
form  of expert judgment  that  would  produce  more  in  the  way  of
regulatory rationality.8 5

These  judgments  might,  however,  result  from  something
other  than  confusion.  They  might  depend  on  judgments  about
sensible  regulatory  priorities  and  about  qualitative  differences
among risks.  I take up this point below.

C.  Incorporating  Complexities

Our first  approximation  has  suggested  that  all  risks  should
be  aligned along a single  metric-expected  annual  deaths,  aggre-
gate mortality  benefits-and  hence  measured  against  each  other.
Both  expert and  economic  approaches  attempt to  do  this,  though
in  interestingly  different  ways.  Experts  tend  to  look  at  expected

annual  deaths  and  to  assess  risks  accordingly.8 6  But  ordinary
people  base  their judgments  on  something  quite  different.  They
look,  for  example,  at  whether  the  risk  is  faced  voluntarily  or
involuntarily;  whether  it  is  distributed  equitably;  whether  it  is
faced  by future  generations;  whether  it  is  potentially  catastroph-
ic;  whether  it  involves  a type  of death  that is  especially  dreaded;
and  whether  it  is  new  and  poorly  understood.  Consider  the  fol-
lowing  summary:

If  aggravating  and  mitigating factors  are  taken  into  account,
it  might well be the  case that people  would find,  say, 300 cases  of
cancer  less  acceptable  than  350  cases  of heart  disease, given cer-
tain  assumptions  about  what  causes  each.  In  contingent  valua-
tion  studies,  people  purport to  be  willing to  pay far more  to  pre-
vent  cancer  deaths  (from  $1.5  million  to  $9.5  million)  than  they
would  to  prevent  unforeseen  instant  deaths  (from  $1  million  to
$5  million).87  It  is  similarly  possible  that  people  might  therefore
accept  a regulated  risk involving  100  annual fatalities  even  if  the
ancillary  risk  involves  110  annual  fatalities;  perhaps  the  ancil-
lary risk is less  severe  because it  is voluntarily run, not especial-

ly  dreaded,  and  well  understood.  The  democratic  decision  to  look
at  something  other than quantity is  easy to  defend.  It  is filly ra-
tional.

We  come,  then,  to  a complication  for  the  initial  approxima-
tion:  risks  should  be  evaluated  in  accordance  with  the  various
qualitative  factors  deemed  relevant  by  ordinary  people  who  are
evaluating  risk.88  Of course,  it  would  be  possible  to  assign  num-
bers to these  factors  if this  step  aided  analysis.

Economic  approaches  promise  to  avoid some  of the problems
of expert  valuations.  Most  important,  private  willingness  to  pay
should  incorporate  some  or  even  all  of  the  factors  that  underlie
ordinary  lay judgments.  It  might be  possible  to  ascertain  private
willingness  to  pay  from  studies  of  actual  market  behavior  and
from  contingent  valuation  studies.8 9  And  from  these  results  it
would be  possible  to  derive  the  diverse  valuations  of  diverse  so-
cial risks.  Consider  the following table:

There  are,  however,  enormous  difficulties  in  the  idea  that
officials  can  get,  from  private  willingness  to  pay,  an  adequate
sense  of how  to  order  the  risks  at  stake  in  regulation.  Health-
health tradeoffs  cannot  easily  be based  on  surrogates  for market
valuation. Actual  choices  are "noisy";  from  a  market  decision-to
take  a job, to buy a Volvo,  to get a smoke alarm-it is not easy to
derive  a  consistent  valuation  of life.  Such  decisions  are  highly
geared to  the context in which  they are  made;  it is not clear that
one  can  infer  from  actual  choices  in  one  context  people's  valua-
tions about  other  choices  in different  contexts.

Contingent valuation  studies  can build in  a sense  of context,
but the answers  may not be reliable. They may well  be a product
of  strategic  behavior,  of  questions  and  answers  not  thought
meaningful  in real life,  or of a perceived  purchase  of moral satis-
faction  rather  than any  commodity.  Valuation  is  greatly  affected
by whether  the  good  is  offered  alone  or  in  connection  with  other
goods. Wildly  different  responses  can be  elicited depending  on the
sequence  of questions;  and  people  often give  the same  amount  to
reflect  their  willingness  to  save  twenty  thousand  or  two  million
members  of  a  certain  species."  In  any  case,  democratic  choices
should reflect  a process  of reason-giving  in which it is asked  what
policies  are  best to  pursue,  rather  than  a process  of  preference-
satisfaction in which each person is  asked how much he is willing
to  pay for a certain result.92  Deliberative  outcomes  should not be
confused  with aggregated  willingness  to  pay.

Government  officials  must,  in  these  circumstances,  proceed
pragmatically  and  experimentally,  perhaps  by  taking  aggregate
numbers  based on expert judgments  as  a starting point, focusing
on  number  of quality-adjusted  life years  saved rather  than sim-
ply  lives  saved,  and  invoking  the  supplemental  considerations
involving  democratic  convictions  that I have  described  here.

IV.  COURTS  AND  EXISTING  LAW

I  now  turn  to  existing  law.  If  an  agency  takes  account  of
ancillary  risks, has it behaved unlawfully?  If an agency refuses  to
consider  such risks, should  courts require  it do  so?

Health-Health Tradeoffs

1561

A.  Voluntary  Agency  Consideration  of Ancillary Risks

Suppose first that an agency actually  considers health-health
tradeoffs.  Is  it  permitted  to  do  so  under  existing  law?  Agencies
have  considerable  flexibility  here,  since  under  current  doctrine,
agencies  have  discretion to  interpret  ambiguities  in  their govern-
ing  statutes  as  they  see  fit.93  If  the  governing  statute  is  ambigu-
ous,  agencies  should  be  permitted  to  consider  health-health
tradeoffs.

Sometimes,  however,  statutes  are  unambiguous  on  this
point,  and  ancillary  risks  are  excluded  as  reasons  for regulatory
action  or inaction.  Under  the  Delaney  Clause,94  for  example,  the
FDA  is  generally  believed  to  be  banned  from  considering  the
possibility  that  the  exclusion  of  foods  with  carcinogens  will  in-
crease  risks  from heart  disease.  The FDA  is  apparently  prohibit-
ed  from  considering  this  or  any  other  ancillary  risk.95  A  similar
problem  arises under  the toxic  substances  provision  of the  Occu-
pational  Safety  and Health Act, which  probably bans  OSHA from
asking whether  richer is  safer, or even  from  balancing workplace
risks  against  ancillary  risks  created by regulation.9 6

But sometimes  agencies  are  given sufficiently  broad  authori-
ty,  and  they  may,  if  they  choose,  consider  ancillary  risks.  For
example,  the  Federal  Insecticide,  Fungicide  and  Rodenticide  Act
("FIFRA")  provides  that  agencies  must  ask  whether  pesticides
produce  "unreasonable  adverse  effects  on  the  environment,"9 7
and  this  term  requires  the  agency  to  take  "into  account  the  eco-
nomic,  social,  and  environmental  costs  and benefits  of the use  of
any  pesticide." 8  Thus  FIFRA  certainly  authorizes  the  EPA  to
consider  the  possibility  that  a  regulation  will  create  aggregate
harms. The Toxic  Substances  Control Act ("TSCA")  reads in simi-
lar  terms.99  The  Clean Air  Act  allows  the  government  to  consid-
er a  broad  range  of good  and bad environmental  effects  in requir-

ability of substitutes).

ing  technologies  to  reduce  air  and  water  pollution."°°  Outside  of
the  context  of  toxic  substances,  the  Occupational  Safety  and
Health  Act  defines  occupational  safety  and  health  standards  as
those  "reasonably  necessary  or appropriate"  to  the goal  of ensur-
ing  "safe or  healthful  employment  and  places  of  employment."'0 '
OSHA  may  reasonably  decide  that  a  standard  is not  "reasonably
necessary  or appropriate"  if  the  effect  of the regulation  is  to  lose
aggregate  lives.  It  is  permitted  to  consider  the  effects  of regula-
tion in  causing  risks  to  life  and  health  through  poverty  and  un-
employment.

We  might  go  further.  As  noted,  courts  generally  defer  to
reasonable  agency  interpretations  of law.  In  addition,  statutes
are  generally  interpreted  so  as  to  avoid  absurdity,  even in the
face  of  apparently  clear  text.' 2  For  the  modern  regulatory
state,  it  would  make sense  for  courts  to  adopt  a new interpretive
principle  to  the effect  that agencies are permitted to minimize net
risks to  life  and health, a  principle that Congress can  overcome
only with  a  clear statement to the contrary. This  principle  makes
particular  sense  in light of the  fact that the  agency  is in  the best
position  to  decide  whether  consideration  of health-health  trade-
offs  would  be  feasible,  or  instead  a barrier  to  successful  imple-
mentation of the underlying  statute. Compared  with courts, agen-
cies  are  both  technically  expert  and  democratically  accountable;
they  are  also  in  a uniquely  good  position  to  obtain  a  systematic
overview  of the  statutes  they  administer,  and  that  position  can
enable  them to  counteract  unintended  harmful  consequences." 3

There  is  a  pervasive  choice,  central  to  administrative  law,
between  comprehensive  rationality  on the  one  hand  and  limited
information  on  the  other.  If  an  agency  tries  to  administer  the
statute  so  as to  move  in the direction  of comprehensive  rationali-
ty  by  ensuring  that  ancillary  health  risks  are  considered,  it
should  be  allowed  to  do  so.  Congress  should  not  lightly  or inad-
vertently be  taken to  have forbidden  agencies  from ensuring that

benefit the  testator's  murderer);  Church of the Holy  Trinity v  United States, 143  US 457

regulations  do  not  create  net  harm  and  that  they  create  the
greatest  possible net  benefit.

This  idea  casts  some  doubt  on  the  courts'  approach  to  the
Delaney  Clause.  In  Les  v  Reilly,  the  EPA  sought  to  create  a de
minimis  exception  to the  Clause  insofar  as  it  prohibits the use  of
any  food  additive  that  has  been  found  to  "induce  cancer." "'  The
FDA  had  made  a  similar  argument  in  Public Citizen v  Young,
where  the  agency  sought  to  exempt  substances  that  created  a
one-in-a-million  lifetime risk of cancer-the  same  risk that would
be  run  if  a  consumer  ate  one  peanut  with  the  FDA-permitted
level  of aflatoxins  once  every  250  days,  and  a risk less  than one
two-hundredth  the  lifetime  risk  incurred  by  the  average  male
smoker.0 5  In  both  cases,  the  government  urged  in  essence  that
"de  minimis  non  curat  lex."  But in Les,  part  of the  EPA's  ratio-
nale  came  close  to  a  suggestion  that the  exception  may  well,  on
balance,  decrease  risks  to life  and health.  According  to  the  EPA,
the  Clause  might  allow  substances  on  the market that  are  actu-
ally  less  dangerous  than  other  substances  that  are  permitted
because they do  not  concentrate  in processed  foods.

In neither case  did  the government  seriously press  the claim
that  the  Delaney  Clause,  if  interpreted  literally,  would  increase
health  risks.  Many  people  so  urge."° 
If  the  government  had
done  so,  and  offered  a  convincing  factual  demonstration  to  that
effect,  it  should have  been permitted to interpret  the Clause so as
to decrease risk on balance. The practice of statutory construction
is pervaded by interpretive  principles  designed to  give reason  and
justice  the  benefit  of  the  doubt.' 7  To  existing  principles,  the
courts  should  add  a  suggestion  that  if  at  all  possible,  statutes
will not be  construed  so  as  to block  agencies  from  taking account
of health-health  tradeoffs.' °8

'o  See, for  example,  Merrill, 5 Yale J  Reg  1  (cited in  note 23).

For  a  catalogue  of  existing  principles,  see  William  N.  Eskridge,  Jr.,  Dynamic

Statutory Interpretation 323-33  appendix 3  (Harvard  1994).

'08 The strongest  argument  to the  contrary would borrow  from the idea  of the  penalty
default in  the law  of contract.  See  Ian Ayres  and  Robert Gertner, Filling Gaps in  Incom-

"penalty  default  rules" that would manifestly  not be what  the  parties  would want  in  the
hopes  of encouraging  them to make  their contracts  explicit).  Sometimes,  rules  of contract
law  and statutory interpretation  are designed to  create  incentives to force parties to speak
clearly.  Perhaps  a  literal  interpretation  of  the  Delaney  Clause  would force  Congress  to
think  in  a more  systematic  way;  perhaps  an interpretive  principle  of the  sort I have  sug-
gested  would  decrease  that  incentive.  It  is unlikely, however,  that penalty  defaults  work
very well  in  the  context  of statutory  interpretation,  and  there  is no  good  evidence  that

B.  Refusal  To  Consider Ancillary Risks

Now  suppose  that  an  agency refuses  to  consider,  or  to  make
decisive,  the  fact  that  its  decision  to  reduce  one  risk  increases
another  risk. Perhaps  a  new  regulatory  initiative  from  the  NRC
would  increase  the  risks  from  coal-fired  power  plants.  Is  the
NRC's refusal  to  consider  such risks  unlawful?  The first question
is  whether  the  statute  requires  consideration  of ancillary  risks.
The second  question is whether,  if the  statute  does  not do  so,  the
agency's  decision is nonetheless  arbitrary  or  capricious.

As  we  have  seen,  many  statutes  do  not  require  agencies  to
consider  ancillary  risks.  In  any  case,  courts  defer  to  reasonable
agency  interpretations  of  statutes,0 9  so  in  many  instances  the
agency  will  have  the  authority  to  decide  whether  to  consider
ancillary  risks.  If  the  agency  has  the  statutory  authority  not  to
consider  ancillary  risks,  it  is  unlikely,  under  current  law,  to  be
held  that  its  decision  not  to  do  so  was  arbitrary.  The judgment
about  arbitrariness  should  and  probably  would  be  based  on  a
framework  like  that  set  out  in  Part  III  above.11 °  In  an  extreme
case, failure  to consider  risks that are  likely to  be large,  and that
are  not  terribly  costly  to  investigate,  might  be  seen  as  arbitrary
within  the  meaning  of the  APA."'  Indeed,  I  believe,  for  reasons
to be  elaborated  shortly, that courts  should be less reluctant than
they now  are  to find  agency  action arbitrary  on this ground.

A great  deal,  of course,  turns  on existing  information.  When
the  data about  ancillary risks  are  speculative  or unreliable,  agen-
cies  are  probably  not  required  to  consider  such  risks."  OSHA
could  lawfully  conclude-as  it  has  in fact  concluded"'-that  the
evidence  that "richer is safer" is too  speculative  to  be used at this

literalism  has  led  or  is  leading  Congress  to  be  more  attentive  to  the  problem  of unin-
tended  bad consequences.

time. Its decision  to  this effect  ought not to  be found  arbitrary  or
capricious  unless  it  can  be  shown  that  the  evidence  is  in  fact
solid  and  that  the  costs  of incorporating  it  are  reasonable.  The
relevant  provision  of the  statute-the  "reasonably  necessary  or
appropriate"  language-gives  OSHA  discretion  to  do  with  this
evidence  as  it  chooses.  Under FIFRA, by contrast, an agency that
fails  to  consider  ancillary  risks  would  probably  be  violating  the
statute,  at  least  on  a  showing  that  the  ancillary  risks  are  real
and  the costs  of investigation  are not  excessive.

Consider  in this regard  the principal case  involving  the issue
of  health-health  tradeoffs,  Competitive  Enterprise Institute  v
NHTSA  ("CE')."4  NHTSA  establishes  fuel  economy  standards;
in doing so,  NHTSA  is required to  consider  the issue  of "feasibili-
ty."  In  deciding  the  question  of feasibility,  NHTSA  has  taken
account  of  passenger  safety,  including  risks  created  by  regula-
tion,  and while  there  is  a  possible  statutory  issue  here,"5  every-
one  in CEI accepted  NRTSA's  views  on  this  point. The  question
in  the  case  was  whether  NHTSA  acted  lawfully  in  refusing  to
relax  its  fuel  economy  standards  for  certain  model  years.  Auto-
mobile  companies  urged that  relaxation  was required  in  order to
save  lives-because  the  existing  standards  would  lead to  "down-
sizing"  and  hence  to  smaller  and  more  dangerous  vehicles-and
they presented  strong evidence  to this  effect.

The  agency  responded  that  this  evidence  was  unconvincing
and that "domestic manufacturers  should be able to improve  their
fuel  economy  in  the  future  by... technological  means,  without
outsourcing  their  larger  cars,  without further  downsizing  or mix
shifts toward  smaller  cars, and without sacrificing  acceleration  or
performance."" 6  The  court  held  that  this  explanation  was  inad-
equate.  The  agency  failed  to  claim  or  show  that  manufacturers
would actually fail to  downsize  their cars.  In  any case  downsizing
would  be costly  and that "cost  would translate  into  higher prices
for large  cars  (as well  as  small), thereby  pressuring consumers  to
retain  their  old  cars  and  make  the  associated  sacrifice  in  safety.

Stat  1379  (1994).  It  is  not  clear  that  this  provision  allows  NHTSA  to  consider  safety
effects  as  part of its judgment about  feasibility. Compare American Textile Manufacturers

The  result  would  be  effectively  the  same  harm  that  concerns
petitioners  and  that  the  agency  fails to  negate  or justify.""7  The
court  therefore  remanded  to  the  agency  for  a better explanation
or a change  in policy.

On remand,  the  agency  offered  a  somewhat  better  explana-
tion. NHTSA pointed  to what  it saw  as the  absence  of clear  indi-
cations  that  fuel  economy  standards  had  caused  any  manufac-
turer to  price  consumers  out  of the market  for larger, safer  cars.
NHTSA  referred  as  well  to  an  absence  of manufacturer  claims
about  the  specific  design  standards  that  would  result  from  the
standards.  The  court  found  this  explanation  sufficient."'  In  do-
ing so,  it applied  a highly deferential  standard  of review.

In light of the record, however,  and the predictable  pressures
on  an  agency  like  NHTSA,  the  result  in  the  case  might  well  be
questioned.  NHTSA  may  well  suffer  from  a  form  of "tunnel  vi-
sion,"  especially  in  dealing  with  fuel  economy  standards,  for
which  there  is  a  powerful  constituency."'  The  interests  that
call  for  attention  to  ancillary  safety  risks  are  typically  poorly
organized,  and  when the claims  come from  the automobile  manu-
facturers,  NHTSA  may be too ready to distrust  them. To  say this
is  not  to  say  that  NHTSA  should  be  required  to  relax  its  fuel
economy  standards.  But it  is to  say  that  a demonstration  of the
sort made by the automobile manufacturers  might well serve  as a
kind  of warning  signal  to  the  court,  requiring  a  solid  response
from the  agency.  In  CEI, the agency's  response  could  not  qualify
as  solid, as the  court itself, while affirming the agency,  seemed  to
suggest.

A promising model for the future is provided  by an important
court  of appeals  decision  holding  that  under  a  statute  that  re-
quired  open-ended  balancing  of relevant  factors,  an  agency  was
required  to  ask  whether  the  risks  that  would  substitute  for  as-
bestos  would  lead  to  even  greater  risks.'2  Thus  the  court  em-
phasized  that  asbestos  was  the  safest  material  for brake  linings
and  that  safe  substitutes  might  not  be  found  in  other  areas  as
2
well. 1

The  point  I  am  making  here  might  well  be  generalized.
Agencies  ought  to  be  required  to  show  that  they  are  doing  more

good  than  harm.'  This  does  not  mean  that  courts  should  en-
gage  in  independent  review  of agency  judgments  on  this  score.
But it does mean  that courts  should take a "hard look"  at agency
decisions  failing to undertake  health-health  comparisons.'

V.  NEW  INSTITUTIONS

A.  Congress

In  its  present  form,  Congress  is ill  equipped  to  consider  the
problem  of  health-health  tradeoffs.  Its  committee  structure  en-
sures  a high  degree  of fragmentation  and  does  not  allow  for  de-
liberation  on  such  tradeoffs.  On  the  contrary,  that  structure
makes  ancillary risks  difficult to  evaluate  or, much worse,  to  see.
Often  ancillary risks  are thought  to be  subject  to  the jurisdiction
of another  committee,  which means,  in practice, that coordination
is  extremely  difficult.  In these  circumstances,  I  offer  two  simple
suggestions  for legislative  reform.

First,  Congress  should  create  a  new  legislative  committee
entrusted  specifically  with  the  power  to  assess  aggregate  risk
levels,  to  compare  risks,  and  to  initiate  revision  of statutes  that
increase  net  risks.  This  committee  should  have  the  authority  to
introduce  corrective  legislation  when  a  statute,  or  agency  action
under  a  statute,  has  been  shown  to  increase  aggregate  risks.
Congress's  current  efforts  in  this  regard  are  far  too  modest.
introduction  of  a  regular  "Corrections
Speaker  Gingrich's 
Day"'  may  provide  some  modest  deterrence  and  offer  protec-
tion  against  abuses, but  it is  far too  irregular  to  provide  the sort
of coordination  that is  needed.  No  institution in  Congress  is in  a
position  to  ensure  against  selective  attention  in  lawmaking;  a
new  committee  could  help solve  this problem.

Second,  Congress  should  address  the  problem  of  health-
health  tradeoffs  through  a  new  directive  in  the  Administrative

tion  Conference v  FPC, 354 F2d  608  (2d Cir  1965)  (explaining  that the court's  duty is "to
see  to  it  that  the  Commission's  decisions  receive  the  careful  consideration  which  the
statute  contemplates"  and holding  that the FPC had failed  to  compile  a record  sufficient
to  support its decision).

'  "Corrections  Day"  was  suggested  by  Speaker  of  the  House  Newt  Gingrich  as  a
separate  calendar  to  "correct"  ambiguous,  arbitrary,  or  ludicrous  laws  and  regulations.

Procedure  Act.  Notably,  recent  initiatives  designed  to  require
cost-benefit  balancing  say  almost  nothing  about  this  problem.
The principal  exception  is  a House  bill introduced  in  1995,  which
contains  a  subsection  entitled  "substitution  risks."  This  subsec-
tion  says  that "[e]ach  significant  risk assessment  or risk charac-
terization  document  shall  include  a  statement  of any  significant
substitution  risks  to  human  health, where  information  on  such
risks has  been provided  to  the agency." '

But this is  a strikingly modest  initiative. It does  not require
agencies  to  investigate  ancillary  risks  on  their  own.  Nor  does  it
say  that  agencies  may  not  proceed  unless  the  regulation  yields
netbenefits.  I suggest instead  a new  amendment to the Adminis-
trative  Procedure  Act:  'Agencies shall ensure, to  the  extent feasi-
ble,  that regulations do  not create countervailing risks that are
greater than those of the  regulated risk." A  modest  forerunner  of
this  idea can be  found  in the "clean  fuels"  provision  of the Clean
Air  Act,  which  says that  the  Administrator  of  the EPA  may  not
prohibit the use of a fuel or fuel additive "unless he finds...  that
in  his judgment  such  prohibition  will  not  cause  the  use  of any
other  fuel  or  fuel  additive  which  will  produce  emissions  which
will  endanger  the public health  or welfare  to the  same  or greater
degree  than  the  use  of  the  fuel  or  fuel  additive  proposed  to  be
prohibited."  This  idea  should  be  generalized.  The  words  "to
the  extent  feasible"  are  necessary  because  some  investigations
are too  costly and  speculative  to be  worthwhile.

B.  Executive  Branch

OIRA has been  entrusted with the power  to coordinate  regu-
latory  policy  and  to  ensure  reasonable  priority  setting.2 
In  the
Clinton administration,  OIRA  appears to  have become  an  adviso-
ry  body,  more  limited  in  its  power  than  it was  in the  Bush  and
Reagan  administrations.  In  view  of the  absence  of good  priority
setting,  and  the  enormous  room  for  saving  costs  and  increasing
regulatory benefits,  this is highly unfortunate.

OIRA  should  see,  as one  of its  central  assignments,  the task
of overcoming  governmental  tunnel  vision,  by  ensuring  that  ag-
gregate  risks  are  reduced  and  that  agency  focus  on  particular
risks does not mean that  ancillary risks are ignored  or increased.
This  is  a  more  modest  and  particularized  version  of  Justice
Breyer's larger  suggestion  that  OIRA  should have  a power  to  set
priorities  by  diverting  resources  from  smaller  problems  to larger
ones.' 
It also  fits  with the  emerging  interest  in "common  sense
government."'  No  body  in  government  is  now  entrusted  with
the authority  of ensuring that risk regulation is managed so  as to
ensure  global  rationality  and  coherence.  OIRA  is well situated to
take  on  that  role,  at  least  by  attending  to  the  possibility  that
regulation  of  some  risks  may  make  risk  levels  higher  on  bal-
ance. 130

CONCLUSION

On the  fiftieth  anniversary  of the  Administrative  Procedure
Act,  it  would  be  far  too  simple  to  say  that  the  administrative
state has  been  a failure.  In many ways,  it has been a substantial
success.  Risks  to  safety  and  health  are  much  lower  than  they
have  been  in  the  past,  partly  because  of  regulatory  safe-
guards.'3'  But  current  programs  are  far  more  costly,  and  far
less  effective,  than  they  should be.  Reforms  to  the  APA,  as  that
Act was  originally  envisaged,  would be  much  too  modest  to  pro-
vide  adequate  correctives.  Existing  difficulties  cannot  be  solved
by weakening  or  intensifying  standards  of judicial  review,  or by
increasing  or decreasing  the  procedures  that  are required before
agencies  undertake  regulatory  action.

As  the  twenty-first  century  approaches,  it  is  especially  im-
portant  to  design  regulatory  institutions  that  counteract  the
identifiable  problems  of modern  regulation.  These  problems usu-
ally  stem from  selective  attention  in the  form  of inadequate  con-
cern  for  setting  priorities,  for  providing  good  incentives,  and  for
minimizing  harmful  side-effects.  The  relevant  reforms  would

justify  an Administrative  Substance  Act  of the general  sort that
is receiving  considerable  current  attention in Congress." 2

Among  the  principal  side-effects,  not  well  addressed  in  cur-
rent  proposals  or  existing  law,  is  the  increased  risk  sometimes
produced  by risk regulation.  Selective  attention  of this kind  is  a
natural  outcome  of  the  cognitive  limitations  of  human  beings;
sometimes  it is the product  of self-conscious  efforts  by well  orga-
nized  private  groups.  In  any  case,  selective  attention  can  easily
be  exploited  by such groups  intent on redistributing  resources  in
their  favor. This  is  a significant  problem,  and  through some  sim-
ple  steps,  something  can be done  about it.

I  have  emphasized  that  tradeoffs  among  risks  ought  not  to
be  based  on  a unitary  metric,  for reasons  of both  law  and  basic
principle.  Lives  are not  commensurable  with  costs;  lives  are  not
even  commensurable  with  lives.  The  context  in  which  life  is  put
at  risk  matters  a  great  deal.  But tradeoffs  must  nonetheless  be
made.  The  problem  is  that  public  institutions  do  not  undertake
this  task in  a self-conscious  manner. New  institutions  should  be
designed  so  as to  overcome  the cognitive  problems  and to  ensure
that  the  relevant  tradeoffs  are made  in  a way  that entails  more
knowledge  and  more  deliberation.  Above  all,  institutions  should
be  created  to  ensure  that  risk  reduction  is  pursued  more  fre-
quently  than  risk  redistribution.  To  accomplish  this  task,  it  is
necessary  to  take  steps  to  limit  the  effects  of myopia,  selective
attention,  and interest-group  influence  in the regulatory process.
I  have  suggested  several  possible  steps.  Under  existing  law,
agencies  should  often  be  understood  to  have  the  authority  to
engage  in health-health  tradeoffs,  and they  should  exercise  that
authority  far more  often than they  now  do.  Courts  should play  a
modest  but  catalytic  role  in  encouraging  agencies  to  increase
aggregate  risk reduction. They  should  do  so,  above  all, by adopt-
ing  an  interpretive  principle  authorizing  agencies  to  perform
health-health  analysis  unless  Congress  has  expressly  forbidden
them  from  so  doing.  Congress  should  create  a  new  committee
designed  to  rank  risks  and  monitor  risk  regulation  for  overall
coherence;  it  should  also  add  to  existing  legislation  a  general
requirement  that  agencies  consider  all  risks,  to  the  extent  that
this is feasible. Finally,  OIRA (or some  similar institution) should
undertake  the  process  of  scrutinizing  risk  regulation  to  ensure
that  agency  action  does  not  suffer  from  the  kinds  of tunnel  vi-
