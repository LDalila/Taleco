Philosophers,politicalscientists,and lawyershave devoted considerable
attentionto therole ofnormsin thetwoareas forwhichAnglo-American
legal systemsare mostfrequentlycelebrated: the common law and
constitutionallaw. Thus, for example,judicial elaboration of common law
principlesofcontract,tort,and propertyhas been described(alternately)
as an efforto promoteeconomicefficiencoyr to protectprivateautonomy;
and backgroundnormsof varioussortshave been developed fromthese
premises.So too,theroleofnormsin thechoiceamongdifferensttrategies
forinterpretingtheopen-ended phrasesoftheConstitutionis reasonably
well understood.</p>
      <p>There is a conspicuous gap, however,in the treatmentof statutory
interpretationT.he gap is strikingin lightofthefactthattheinterpretation
of statuteshas become by farthe mostfrequentand importanttaskfor
judges (and administrators)in industrializeddemocracies. Although
interpretationof regulatorystatutesfrequentlydeterminesthe content
and scope of programsaffecting(forexample) pollution,energy,nuclear
power, endangered species, workers,and victimsof discriminationi,t is
in thissettingthatcourtsare said to have littleor no room to move. On
theusual view,theirroleis to actas agentsofthelegislaturei,mplementing
itscommands. Indeed, it is here thatcourtsare said to act,at least most
of the time,without"interpretation"or "norms"at all. In these
circumstances,thenotionthatnormsplaya major role in statutoryconstruction
mightseem iconoclasticor even bizarre.</p>
      <p>In thisessay,I want to argue thatextratextualnorms-understood
as principlesabout constitutionaglovernmenti,nstitutionaalrrangements,
basic fairness,and regulatoryfailure-do in factplay a crucial role in
the interpretationof statutes.Indeed, descriptiveand prescriptivework
on thistopicis impossiblewithoutan understandingoftheroleofnorms.

extratextualnorms are a necessarypart of statutoryinterpretationI.n
thesecond part,whichis morespeculative,I describepossiblefoundations

Above all, I urge thatit is desirable,not to limitthe role of such norms,
but to identifythem,to evaluate them,and to develop and apply norms

      <title>Textualism</title>
      <p>It is sometimessuggestedthatthestatutor ylanguageis theonlylegitimate
basis forinterpretationT.he principalfeatureof the textualistcreed is
the belief that courts have no license to rely on "outside sources." A
particulartargethere is theuse of normsthatcannotbe tiedto statutory
textitself.The language of thestatute-and nothingelse-is thesource
ofjudicial power and the object ofjudicial concern.</p>
      <p>Textualism appears to be enjoying a renaissance in a number of
recentcases, and perhaps in the academy as well. Whateverits precise
form,however,thetextualistapproach is inadequate.The centralproblem
isthatwordsare notself-definingt;heirmeaningdepends on bothculture
and context.There is no such thingas a preinterpretivetext,and words
have no meaning beforeor withoutinterpretationT.o say thisis not to
say thatwords used in statutescan mean anythingat all. (Confusion of
thetwoquite separatepointshas been frequentin recentworkon literary
interpretationand on linguistics.)But itis to say thatstatutorytermsare
indeterminatestanding"bythemselves,"and, more important,thatthey
never stand by themselves.For thisreason, backgroundnormsof
interpretation,orientingthejudicial reader to the textbut not "in" it,are an
indispensable part of interpretation.</p>
      <p>Usually the backgroundnormsare so widelyshared-for example,
that Congress is speaking in English, that Congress is not joking or
attemptingto mislead, or that courts should not decide cases simply
according to theirpredilections-that theyare invisible.But in easy as
well as hard cases, courtsmustresortto such normsifinterpretationis
to proceed. For example, thequestion whetherthe enactmentof federal
environmentalstatutespreemptsall of statetortlaw is an easy one-it
does not-not because of the statutorytext"itself"but because of
universallyshared understandingsabout the limitedpreemptiveeffectof
federalenactments.</p>
      <p>So far,perhaps, those who accept textualistapproaches mightbe in
agreement.Perhapstheywould agree thatthemeaningofwordsis largely
a functionofbackgroundnormsabout how textsshould be approached.
Indeed, we maydefinean easy case as one in whichthereis a consensus
about thegoverningnorms.But theproblemfortextualismgoes deeper.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>Normsand StatutorIynterpretation 805</title>
      <p>In manyhard cases, thesource ofthedifficultiys thattheparticularkind
of background norm and the nature of its application will be highly
controversial.</p>
      <p>Assume,forexample, thatthequestion is whethera statutecreating
a regulatoryagencyto bar racialdiscriminationin employmentimplicitly
authorizes privatesuits by victimsof discriminationagainst employers
who have engaged in discrimination.If the statuteand its historyare
silenton the question, the case cannot be decided withoutintroducing
background norms, which are necessaryto tell interpreterswhat such
silencemeans. Thus itshould be unsurprisingthatjudges skepticalabout
implied causes of action have relied, not on statutory"text,"but on a
backgroundassumption,traceableto a particularunderstandingof
separation of powers,thatonly the legislaturemay create such rights,and
thatstatutorysilence should be assumed not to do so.</p>
      <p>These considerationsaccount forthe
pervasivedifficultiewsithtextualistapproaches to statutoryconstruction:ambiguity,delegation or
gaps, overinclusivenessu,nderinclusivenessa,nd changed circumstances.
The most familiarproblem is thatstatutorylanguage is
sometimesambiguous. It is not clear, for example, whetherthe
term"feasible"contemplatescost-benefitanalysis,whethera statutoryreferenceto "wages"
is meantto includeemployercontributiontso a pensionprogram,whether
regulatorypoweroverthebroadcastingindustryincludescable television,
or whethera prohibitionof "discriminationb"arsvoluntaryrace-conscious
measures designed to counteractthe effectsof past and
presentdiscrimination against blacks.' In all of these cases, moreover,it is uncertain
whetherthe language should be taken to referto the originalmeaning
of those words for the enacting legislature(assuming thatidea can be
made intelligiblein lightof the problems of aggregatingthe views of
numerous actors) or should instead take account of
contemporaryunderstandingsofwhatthewordsmean. By itself,textualismcannotanswer
these questions.</p>
      <p>Statutesmightalso representa delegation of lawmakingpower to
courts,or containgaps thatinterpretersmustfill.For example, thebasic
termsof the most importantAmerican antitrustlaw-forbidding
"conspiracies in restraintof trade"-are uninformativeabout the sorts of
norms that mightbe broughtto bear in deciding preciselywhich
conspiraciesare unlawful.So too,thestatutoryprohibitionon "discrimination"
in civilrightslaw is silenton burdens of pleading and production,the
appropriatestatuteof limitationsa,nd a rangeof additionalimplementing
rules. In such cases, the problemis thatthe textrequiresinterpretersto
look to sources outside of its fourconcerns.</p>
      <p>Sometimes,language thatwould in many contextsbe
entirelyunambiguous should not be the only basis for interpretationT.he literal
language of a statute-the meaning of itstermsin
ordinarysettingswillsuggestan outcome thatwould make littleor no sense. Suppose, for
example, that a state law says that no vehicles are permittedin public
parksand thata cityproposes to build in a parka monumentconsisting
oftanksused in WorldWar 11.2 Here whatappears tobe theunambiguous
language must yield,for the statutecould not reasonablybe taken to
forbidsuch a monument,which causes none of the harms the statute
could be thoughtto prevent.</p>
      <p>The example is not fanciful.The Supreme Court recentlysaid that
a statuteexempting state and local public housing agencies "fromall
taxation... imposed bythe United States"should not be interpretedto
include an exemptionfromfederalestatetax.3The Court held thatthe
exemptiondid not mean whatit appeared to say in lightof the
contemporaneous understandingthatan excise tax was not
ordinarilycomprehended withinthecategoryof"taxation."Or suppose thatthelegislature
has said thatan employermay dischargean employee "forany reason."
Is the employertherebyauthorizedto fireworkerswho have refusedto
commitcrimeson his behalf? Mighta man who has murderedhis wife
inheritfromher under a statuteallowing spouses to inherit"under all
circumstances"?These are examples of what mightbe describedas the
overinclusivenessof textualism:the possibilitythat statutorylanguage,
read withoutregard to context,willreach situationsthatitought not to
cover.</p>
      <p>Courts encounter the problem frequently.4A passage
fromWittgensteinindicatesthe basic difficulty":Someone says to me: 'Shew the
childrena game.' I teach them gaming withdice, and the other says 'I
didn'tmean thatsortof game.' Must theexclusionof the game withdice
have come beforehis mind when he gave me the order?"5The example
shows that sometimesthe best interpretationof a textualcommand is
one thatruns counter to itsapparent literalmeaning-even in cases in
which the author did not have in mind the particularcase at issue or
make a judgment about how thatcase should be resolved.</p>
      <p>Although it arises less frequently,there is also a possibilitythat
textualismwill be underinclusive.This problem occurs when the text,
read outside of context,does not regulateconductthatthe statute,most</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>Normsand StatutorIynterpretation 807</title>
      <p>plausiblyread, should be understood to control.A particulardifficulty
here is thata statutemay be "evaded" by privateingenuity.The literal
language of the statutedoes not cover the situation,but because the
privateconduct causes all of the harmsthatthe statuteprevents,courts
sometimeshold a statuteapplicable notwithstandingits precise terms.6
ConsiderJusticeHolmes's suggestionthatcourtsare "apt to errbysticking
too close to the words of a law where those words importa policythat
goes beyond them."7</p>
      <p>The discussion thus far has assumed that circumstanceshave not
changed significantlysince the statutewas enacted. But the difficulties
of textualismbecome all the more severe when time has affectedthe
assumptionsunder whichthestatutewas originallywrittenC.onsiderthe
Delaney Clause, which forbidsthe use as food additivesof substances
that "induce" cancer. The Delaney Clause was enacted at a timewhen
carcinogenicsubstances were difficultto detect,and all
detectablecarcinogenswereextremelydangerous.Currentlyc,arcinogensare detectable
at exceptionallylow levels,and manyof them pose trivialrisks.In such
circumstances,mighttheword"induce" allowthegovernmenttoexempt
fromregulationcarcinogensthatpose trivialrisks?Mechanicalapplication
ofthetextin newcircumstancesislikelytoproduce interpretivbelunders.</p>
      <p>All thissuggeststwoprincipalpoints.First,and mostfundamentally,
there is no such thingas an acontextual "text"thatcan be used as the
exclusiveguide to interpretationI.n easy cases, backgroundnorms-on
which there is wide or universalconsensus-are part of the process of
ascertainingstatutorymeaning.Preciselybecause thenormsare so widely
shared, theyappear invisibleand are not an object of controversyI.n
othercases,usuallytreatedas hardones,courtsmustresortto a contestable
background norm in order to resolve an interpretivedispute. It is in
these settings,and in thissense, thattextualismis inevitablyincomplete.</p>
      <p>Second, it is by no means obvious thatcourtsshould alwaysrelyon
the textor on the "plain meaning" of wordseven in cases in whichsuch
relianceis possibleand leads to determineresults.An interpretivsetrategy
thatrelies exclusivelyon the ordinary,dictionarydefinitionof words is
preciselythat-an interpretivestrategythatreflectsa choiceamong
competing possibilities-and in manycases it willproduce
irrationalitya,bsurdityo,r an inferiorsystemoflaw.The invocationofbackgroundnorms
of various sortspromisesto be a salutarycorrective.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>TheInevitableFailureoftheAgencyViewoftheJudicialRole</title>
      <p>Thus far we have seen that the most prominentspecies of the agency
viewof thejudicial role appears to fail.It is timeto see whatconclusions
emergefromthatfailure.On whatremainsthemostwellknownapproach
to the matter,the processof statutoryconstructioninvolvesascertaining
the meaning of the legislativecommand in the particularcase. This
approach sees the courtsas agents or servantsof the legislature.</p>
      <p>On the agency view,courtsshould say what the statutemeans, and
in thatprocesslanguage, historya,nd structureare relevant;and perhaps
those who accept the agency view,rejectingtextualism,would concede
the need forinterpretiveprinciplesto help orientreader to text.But on
thisview,background norms of other sorts-taken up below-are
impermissibleT.he agencyviewamountsto a formalisatpproachto statutory
construction-formalistbecause it does not permitcourtsto undertake
value-laden inquiries into statutoryfunctionand failureas part of the
process of interpretation.</p>
      <p>The agency view is usually defended by a claim of legitimacy.In a
democraticsystemo,ne withseparatedpowers,itis said tobe impermissible
for courts to invoke norms that cannot be traced to an authoritative
textualinstrumentT.he claimofillegitimacyisbuttressedby(orreducible
to) a range of prudentialconsiderations:the use of backgroundnorms
willtend to increasejudicial discretion,decrease legislativeattentiveness,
produce uncertaintya,nd riskusurpationbyjudges of powers accorded
to legislativeand executiveactors.In thissense,thedebateoverformalism
in statutoryconstructionreplicatesa similardebate in constitutionalaw.
As a particularlycrispexpressionof the agencyviewof thejudicial role,
considerthewordsofJusticeHolmes, who, afterdescribinga regulatory
statuteas "foolish,"added: "If my fellowcitizenswant to go to Hell I
willhelp them. It's myjob."8</p>
      <p>The agencyviewcontainsan importanttruth.It would be improper
forcourtsto "interpret"statutesby construingthemto mean whatever
thejudges thinkwould be best. No one could defend an approach to
statutoryconstructionthat would license judges to say that a statute
meanswhatevera good statutewouldsay.Itfollowsfromthisunderstanding
thatwherethereis neitherinterpretivdeoubtnor constitutionaolbjection,
it is thejudgment of the electorallyaccountable branch,and not thatof
thejudges, thatwill prevail.</p>
      <p>Notwithstandingthese considerations,the formalistposition,and
the agency view of statutoryconstruction,are subject to two decisive
objections.First,the formalistconceptionof "meaning"is fartoo crude.
As we have seen,language is not self-interpretinCgo.urtscannot"simply"
be agents. The instructionsof the principal are unintelligiblewithout
backgroundnormsthatinterpretersalone can supply.It is importantto
emphasize that this is a conceptual or logical claim, not a proposition
about the appropriate distributionof powers as among administrators,
courts,and legislatures.</p>
      <p>Suppose thismuch were acknowledged,and itwere suggestedthat
courts should relyon the agency view "as much as possible." This is a
8. Holmes-LaskLietterse,d. M. Howe (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard UniversityPress,
1953), vol. 1, p. 249.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>Normsand StatutorIynterpretation 809</title>
      <p>highlyambiguous concept,but perhaps itcan be takento argue in favor
ofadherencetolegislativemeaningtotheextentthatitisfairlyascertainable
forjudges equipped withconventionalor uncontestedbackgroundnorms.
The second problem forthe agencyview is thatitsclaim of illegitimacy
relies on question begging and probably indefensiblepremises. That
claimmustbe defendedbya setofinstitutionaalnd substantivaerguments,
and thoseargumentsare hardtosupply.The claimmustbe thata formalist
approach to construction-again, to the extentthatit is possible-will
lead on balance to the best or most sensible systemof law. But it is far
more likelythatthe introductionof otherconsiderationswillaccomplish
thatgoal. Assume,forexample,thatstatutor ylanguage,whileambiguous,
is mostnaturallyread to lead in a directionthatis,bygeneralconsensus,
absurd and could not plausiblyhave been intended; thata statutemight
be understoodas givingopen-ended authorityto a bureaucracy;thatthe
most obvious reading of a statuteprovides bizarre or unjust resultsin
lightofchangesin thefiftyearssinceitsenactmentt;hatan appropriations
measure appears to intrudeon a carefullyelaborated(and
sensible)compromise in the environmentalfield. In all of these settings,invocation
of backgroundnormswilllead to betteroutcomes. In such cases, courts
thatactas somethingotherthanmereagentswillproduce a moresensible
systemof law.</p>

      <title>The UnlikelyPromiseof"Canons"-and an Analogy</title>
      <p>How, in lightof these considerations,ought the problem of statutory
constructionto be understood?Some help in thisregardmightbe found
in an unlikelyplace. In interpretingstatutes,courtshave oftenreliedon
canonsn" of construction.I will use the term "canons" to referto all
backgroundnorms thatare used in statutoryconstruction.</p>
      <p>Anydefenseof thecanons mustcome to termswithone of the most
important(and characteristicc)ontributionosf the legal realistmovement,
whichwas to discreditthe canons. The mostimportantexample is Karl
Llewellyn'scelebratedeffortto demonstratethatforeach canon thereis
an equal canon pointingin the opposite direction.9In Llewellyn'sview,
an inspectionof the decisions revealed thatthe canons did not help to
decide cases; insteadtheyoperatedas mechanical,after-the-farcetcitations
disguisingthe reasons fordecision. This view of the canons has deeply
penetrated modern legal culture. Almost no one has had a favorable
word to say about the canons in manyyears.</p>
      <p>But the canons of constructioncontinueto be a prominentfeature
in the federal and state courts.The use of guides to construction-in
theformofbackgroundunderstandingsand principlesrequiringa "clear
statement"from Congress in various settings-can be found in every
9. See K. Llewellyn,"Remarkson the Theory of Appellate Decisions and the Rules
or Canons about How StatutesAre to Be Construed,"VanderbilLtaw Review3 (1950): 395.
area of modern law. And thereis no sign thatcanons are decreasingin
importance-partly, as we have seen, because of theirinevitabilityand
partlybecause oftheirplausibilityon substantivegrounds.The deviation
betweenjudicial practiceand academicconsensusis somethingofa puzzle.</p>
      <p>An analogy may be helpfulhere. The law of contractsis pervaded
by-indeed, itconsistslargelyof-a setofprinciplesfillingin contractual
gaps when the parties have been silent,or when the meaning of their
words is unclear. The use of implied termsis a familiarpart of the law
ofcontracta;nd itwouldbe mostpeculiartosaythattheyare an illegitimate
incursion into the usual process of "interpreting"the parties' intent.
Withoutimplied termsof some sort,contractssimplywould not be
susceptibleto construction.</p>
      <p>To a large degree, interpretivenorms serve the same functionin
publiclaw.They too helpjudges toconstruebothstatementsand silences;
theytoo should not be seen as the intrusionof controversiajludgments
into "ordinary"interpretationB.ut thereare differencesas well as
similarities.In the law of contract,itis oftensaid thatimpliedtermsshould
attemptto "mimic the market"by doing what the parties would do if
theyhad made provisionson the subject. In the law of
statutoryconstruction,by contrast,the notionof "mimickingthe market"is farfrom
a complete guide. Sometimesit willbe extremelyunclear how Congress
wouldhave resolvedthequestion;sometimestheresolutionoftheenacting
Congress would have been differentfromthatof the currentCongress,
and it is not clear whose resolutionshould control; sometimescourts
properly call into play principles-many of them constitutionally
inspired-that push statutesin directionsthatdivergefromtheconclusion
thatCongress would have reached ifit had resolvedthe matter.</p>
      <p>Despite these differencest,he analogy to contractlaw revealsthatit
is impossibleto dispense withbackgroundnormsin interpretingterms.
In the contextof statutoryconstruction,however,such normswilloften
servefunctionsotherthan thatof applyingthejudgment thatCongress
would have reached ifit had addressed the question.</p>

      <title>TheFunctionsofInterpretivPerinciplesA: Catalog</title>
      <p>Partoftheproblemiscomingtotermswiththecanons,or withbackground
normsof interpretations,temsfromthe factthattheyservea varietyof
differentgoals. Those goals fallin fourbasic categories.
1. Orientationtomeaningin particularcases.-Interpretive norms may be
designed to orientjudicial readers to the textin order to help them to
ascertainitsmeaningin theparticularcase. This is themostuncontroversial
functionofinterpretivperinciplest,houghnotall ofthemsensiblypromote
thisgoal. Consider,forexample,theidea thatthelanguage ofa particular
provisionwillbe taken in the contextof the statuteas a whole and will
not be interpretedso as to do violence to statutorystructure.The
understandingthat even apparentlyunambiguous statutorytermsmight</p>
      <p>Normsand StatutorIynterpretation 811
have a counterintuitivemeaning if other provisionsof the statuteso
indicate is a sensible way of understandingstatutorymeaning in the
particularcase.
2. Interpretivienstructions.-Interpretive norms may serve as guides to
whatmightbe called theinterpretiveinstructionsofthelegislature.Such
principlesare designed to capture an actual or hypotheticallegislative
judgment about how statutesshould be construed.They do not serveas
guidance to meaning in the particularcase but, instead,attemptto
incorporate explicitor implicitcongressionalcommands withrespect to
the interpretiveprocess.</p>
      <p>The easiest cases here involveexplicitlegislativeinstructionsabout
interpretationT.hus the firstsectionsof the United States Code set out
a seriesofguidelinesforcourtsto followin interpretingstatutes.'0When
Congress has been explicit,therecan be no objection tojudicial use of
the relevantinstructions.Some interpretiveprinciples,however,are a
product of an understandingof implicitratherthan explicitlegislative
interpretivienstructionsC.onsidertheidea thatstatuteswillbe interpreted
so as to be constitutionalratherthan unconstitutional,or thatjudicial
reviewof administrativebehavior will be assumed in the absence of a
clear congressionalinstructionto the contrary.
3. Improvinglawmaking.-A thirdfunctionof interpretivenorms is to
promotebetterlawmaking.Such principlesmight,forexample,minimize
judicialor administrativdeiscretionor pushlegislativeprocessesin desirable
directions.Principlesof thissortattemptneitherto orientthe reader to
the textin the particularcase nor to capture congressionalinstructions
withrespecttointerpretationT. he effortisinsteadtoimprovelawmaking
processes and the deliberationand accountabilitythatare supposed to
accompanythem.In thisrespect,some interpretiveprinciplesfulfilgloals
associated withthe separationof powers and withplausible assessments
of comparativeinstitutionaclompetence.They are designed above all to
channel certaindecisions throughcertaininstitutionsor to improvethe
operation of those institutions.Examples include the idea that
appropriationsstatutes,usuallydone hastily,willnot be understoodto amend
substantivsetatutest;hatimplicitrepealsofpreviouslawswillbe disfavored;
thatstatuteswillnot ordinarilybe read to interferewiththe president's
power in foreignaffairs.
4. Substantivpeurposes.-Finally,interpretivneormsmay servesubstantive
purposes whollyapart fromstatutorymeaning, interpretiveintent,or
the lawmakingprocess. The categoryof substantiveprinciplesspans a
wide range. Substantiveprinciplesmay reflectan objectionablejudicial

value judgment; but they mightderive instead from policies that are
easy to defend.</p>
      <p>Interpretivenormsoftenderivefromconstitutionalprinciples.It is
a familiaridea thatwhen a statutemightbe interpretedto be valid or
invalid,courtsshouldconstrueitso thatitsurvivesconstitutionaclhallenge.
There are numerous othersubstantivenormsas well; manyof themare

of Congress applies onlywithinthe territoriajlurisdictionof the United
States,not to inferexemptions fromtaxation,to assume that criminal
statutesrequiremensrea, to avoid irrationalityto, counteractobsolescence,
and (an outmoded norm) to protectcommon law rightsin the absence
of a clear statementfromCongress.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-12">
      <title>An AlternativMe ethod</title>
      <p>All of these considerationssuggest an alternativeto the conventional
understandingsofstatutoryinterpretationT. he statutorytextisofcourse
thestartingpoint,but itbecomes intelligibleonlybecause ofbackground
norms that give it content.Usually, those norms are so widelyshared,
and so uncontroversial,that the text"alone" appears to be a sufficient
basis forinterpretations;tatementsof thissortmean thattogetherwith
generallyagreed upon interpretiveprinciples,the meaning of the text
is notin doubt. In manycases, however,thetextwillproduce ambiguity,
overinclusiveness,or underinclusiveness.</p>
      <p>In such cases, courts often must resortto background norms of
various sorts.Such normsare sometimesdesigned to reveal meaning in
the particularcases; theyare sometimesintendedto serveproceduralor
substantivepolicies. Sometimestheyserve theirintended purpose well,
and those purposes are not terriblycontroversial.But sometimesthe
relevantpurposesare disputable-considernormscallingfortheprotection

      <title>Normsand StatutorIynterpretation 813</title>
      <p>of the late nineteenthand earlytwentiethcenturiesreflecteda beliefin
common law orderingthatwas largelyrepudiated in the 1930s.</p>
      <p>In thissection,I provide an outline of the basis forand contentof
interpretivenormsthatare designedto promoteconstitutionaplurposes,
and the basic goals of deliberativegovernment,in the post-New Deal
period.</p>
      <p>Sourcesofinterpretipvreinciples</p>
      <p>a) In general-.Interpretive normsrequiresources;and itisimportant
to be quite explicitabout themhere. The firstand moststraightforward
is the Constitution.Understandingsabout constitutionalarrangements
provide a significantamount of the backgroundagainstwhichstatutory
constructionoccurs. To be sure, there is frequentlyuncertaintyabout
constitutionalmeaning; and statutorydisputesare sometimes,in part,a
functionof a broader dispute about the nature of the constitutional
structure.Often,however,thereis sufficientconsensus about the
Constitutionto ground a large part of interpretivepractice.</p>
      <p>The second source of interpretivenorms-also
straightforwardconsistsofunderstandingsabout theappropriateand actualperformance
of governmentalinstitutions.One might,for example, conclude that
appropriationsstatutesare writtenhastilyand withoutdeliberation;that
in the face of ambiguity,courtsshould deferto
administrativeinterpretationsof law; or that,on the contrary,regulatoryagencies should have
littlediscretion.If one weresimplydescribingstatutoryconstructiono,ne
would finda number of backgroundnormstraceableto understandings
of preciselythissort.</p>
      <p>b) The regulatorsytate.-The thirdand finalsource of background
norms involves the intended functionsof regulatorystatutesand the
waysin whichsuch statutestend to failin practice.A detailed discussion
of thesepointswould be wellbeyondthescope ofthepresentdiscussion,
but a briefoutline willbe useful.</p>
      <p>The goals of regulatoryregimesspan a wide range. Some statutes
are designed to promote economic efficiencyo,thersto
redistributeresources in public-regardingways,to reflectsocial values or aspirations,
to counteractthe social subordinationof disadvantaged groups, or to
enforce the termsof pure interest-groupdeals. Moreover,statutesfail
fora varietyofreasons.Sometimestheyare
adverselyaffectedbyinterestgroup power, collective action problems, the absence of political
accountabilityor deliberation,obsolescence, or lack of coordinationwith
other statutes.Other statutesfailbecause of implementationproblems.
Statutesdesigned to redistributeresources,forexample, mayfailto take
account of the way that the marketcan nullifythe intended effects.
Statutesdesigned to reduce or eliminatethe social subordinationof
disadvantaged groups, or to promote noncommodityvalues like
environmental diversity,are frequentlysubject in the implementationprocess
to preciselythe same obstaclesthatmake such statutesnecessaryin the
firstplace. Governmentfailurethus replicatesmarketfailure.'2</p>
      <p>Conclusions of thissortare principallyof interestto regulatorsin
thelegislativeand executivebranches;buttheyare relevanttothejudiciary
as well. Legal interpretationof regulatorystatuteshas in factbeen
responsiveto understandingsabout thelikelyfunctionand failureofthose
statutes.Moreover,legal interpretationis likelyto be improvedby such
understandings.It is notsimple,tobe sure,to make such understandings
operational-to explain exactlyhow theyshould be used in hard cases.
But itis not difficulto show how understandingsof regulatoryfunction
and failurehave worked,and should work,to produce norms-or so I
willbe arguing.</p>

    <sec id="sec-15">
      <title>ThePrinciples</title>
      <p>In this section, I brieflydescribe interpretivenorms drawn from the
threesources described above.
1. Constitutionanlorms-.The constitutionalnorms that play a role in
statutoryinterpretationspan a wide range. The Constitutionprovides
thebackdropagainstwhichstatutesare writtenand interpretedM.oreover,
federal courts underenforcemany constitutionalnorms,and for good
reasons.13 Institutionaclonstraints-mostnotably,the
courts'limitedfactfindingabilityand weak electorallegitimation-lead courtsto be reluctant
to vindicateconstitutionalprincipleswiththe vigorappropriate to
governmentalbodies witha betterdemocraticpedigree. It followsthatsome
statutesshould be understood as responses to Congress's constitutional
responsibilitieseven if courtswould not require Congress to carryout
those responsibilitiesin the firstinstance.Relativelyaggressivestatutory
interpretation-pushingstatutesaway fromconstitutionalltyroublesome
ground-provides a way for courts to vindicatenorms that do in fact
have constitutionalstatus.</p>
      <p>a) Federalism.-In the systemof American public law, the basic
assumptionis thatstateshave authorityto regulatetheirown citizensand
territoryT.his assumptionjustifiesan interpretivenorm calling for a
clear statementin order to support federalpreemptionof statelaw.</p>
      <p>b) Politicaldeliberationt;heconstitutionaanltipathtyonakedinterest-group
transfers.-The American constitutionalregime is built on hostilityto
measures thatimpose burdens or grantbenefitsmerelybecause of the
politicalpower of privategroups; some public value is required
forgovernmentalaction.This norm,traceableto theoriginsof theConstitution
and firmlyrootedin currentlaw,has a numberofimplicationfsorstatutory
interpretationI.t suggests,forexample, thatcourtsshould develop
in</p>
      <p>Normsand StatutorIynterpretation 815
terpretivestrategiesto promote deliberationin government-by, for
example, remandingissues involvingconstitutionallysensitiveinterests
or groups forreconsiderationbythelegislatureor byregulatoryagencies
when deliberation appears to have been absent. It also suggests that
statutesthatembody mere interest-groupdeals should be
narrowlyconstrued.Much ofAmericanadministrativleawis foundedon theseideas.14
c) Politicalaccountabilityth;enondelegatiopnrinciple-.In the period
since the New Deal, courtshave permittedCongress to delegate
exceptionallybroad policy-makingauthorityto regulatoryagencies.Such broad
delegationswereatone timethoughttooffendArticleI oftheConstitution,
which vestslegislativepower in Congress. In recentyears,courtshave
been reluctantoenforcethenondelegationdoctrineB.utthroughstatutory
construction,courts are sometimesable to vindicatethe constitutional
principle against delegation of legislativepower. They can do so, for
example, by narrowlyconstruingdelegationsof policy-makingpower.</p>
      <p>d) Propertyand contractrights.-In the aftermathof the New Deal
reformationc,ourtshave been reluctantto use theConstitution'sexplicit
protectionof propertyand contractin a way thatwould interferewith
social and economic regulation.But courtscan vindicatethoserightsless
intrusivelythroughthe narrowconstructionof regulatorystatutesthat
raiseseriousconstitutionadloubtsunderthecontractsand takingsclause.</p>
      <p>e) Welfarerights.-In recentyears,the Supreme Court has rejected
claims that the Constitutionguarantees rightsof basic subsistence;the
resistancestemslargelyfromreasonsofdemocraticlegitimacyB.ut perhaps
a Court thatsaw substantiveforcein the claim forconstitutionawlelfare
rightswould attempttovindicatethatclaim,notthroughtheConstitution
itselfb,ut throughaggressivestatutoryconstructionso as to ensureagainst
irrationalor arbitrarydeprivationsof benefits.Such an approach would
tend to produce even-handedness in the distributionof welfare in a
democracythathas committeditselfto a "social safetynet." Aggressive
statutoryconstruction,requiringa clear statementforexclusions,might
produce manyof the advantagesof recognitionof constitutionawlelfare
rightswithoutimposing nearlyso severe a strainon thejudiciary.</p>
      <p>f) Disadvantagedgroups-.Some of the most difficultconstitutional
questions involve the extent of protectionaffordedto disadvantaged
groups by the equal protectionclause; and in many cases, courtshave
affordedless protectionthan theymightbecause of a desire to minimize
interferencewiththe politicalbranchesof government.Thus the Court
has required a showingof discriminatory"intent"in order to make out
a violationof the equality principle,and in various ways it has limited
its protectionof blacks, women, and the handicapped.'5 In this light,
statutesthatprovideprotectionforsuch groups,or againstdiscriminatory
effects,mightwell be seen as a legislativeresponse to its
(judiciallyunderenforced)constitutionadluties.Through statutoryconstructionsc,ourts
can ensure thatthe relevantnorms are vindicated.
2. Institutionacloncerns-.A number of interpretiveprinciplesrespond
straightforwardltyo institutionalconcerns,havingto do withthe actual
or appropriatefunctioningof governmentalentities.Most of
theseprinciples are straightforwaradnd can be discussed quite briefly.</p>
      <p>a) Appropriatiosntsatutes.-Courtsconstrueappropriationsprovisions
quite narrowly.That principle can be connected withjudicial
understandingsabout the characterof the appropriationsprocess, in which
legislativedeliberationis highlyunlikely,and interest-grouppower is
peculiarlylikelytomakeitseffectsfelt.Narrowconstructionofappropriationsstatutespromotesdeliberationin government.</p>
      <p>b) Thepresumptioinnfavorofjudicial review-.Courts presume that
thelegislaturehas notprecludedjudicial reviewofagencydecisions.This
presumption is partly attributableto a belief-vindicated by recent
experience' that regulatoryagencies are susceptibleto factionalism
and self-interestedrepresentationJ.udicialreviewoperatesas a powerful
ex ante deterrentagainstdangersof thissort;itis also an ex post
corrective.IfCongressistoeliminatejudiciarleviewi,tmustdo so unambiguously.</p>
      <p>c) Impliedexemptionfrsomtaxation.-Courts do not inferexemptions
fromtaxation.This principleis partlya resultof a desire to protectthe
Treasury; it is partlya productof a viewthatexemptionsfromtaxation
frequentlyreflectthe influenceof well-organizedprivategroups.</p>
      <p>
        d) The ruleoflaw.-Courts interpretstatutesso as to promote the
rule oflaw. The mostconspicuous example is the rule of lenity:criminal
statuteswillbe construedfavorablytothedefendant,above all topromote
fairnotice.Other illustrationsinclude ajudicial assumptionthatstatutes
do not apply retroactivelyt,hatadministrativediscretionis narrow,and
thatadministratorshave the authorityto proceed by rule.
3. Counteractinsgtatutorfyailure-.I have suggested that a number of
interpretivenormsmightbe designed to counteractfailuresin social and
economic regulation. In this space, it will be possible only to list the
relevantnorms.Where thereis interpretivedoubt,a perceptionof
characteristicpathologiesin regulatorylegislationhelpsin
statutoryconstruction. Courts should, I suggest,construe regulatorystatutesso that (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        )
politicallyunaccountable actorsare prohibitedfromdecidingimportant
issues; (

        ) collectiveaction problemsdo not subvertstatutoryprograms;

        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ) differentregulatorystatutesare, to the extentpossible,coordinated
intoa coherentwhole;(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ) obsoletestatutesare keptconsistenwtithchanging

        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ) irrationality,
measuredagainstthestatute'sown purposes,isavoided. These principles
apply acrosstheuniverseofregulatorystatutes,thoughtheirapplication
willvarywiththe statutoryfunction.
      </p>
      <p>In lightof the conventionaldifficultieins theimplementationprocess,
courtsshould also, I suggest,generouslyconstruestatutesdesigned to
protecttraditionallydisadvantaged groups and noncommodityvalues.
Courts should attemptto ensure as well thatthe costsof regulationare
proportionateto thebenefitsand thatde minimisexceptionsto regulatory
requirementsare permittedor required. Finally,statutesthat embody
interestgroup transfersshould be narrowlyinterpreted.</p>
      <p>It shouldbe clearthatsome oftheseideas are a productofcontestable
substantivetheories.Some of them depend fortheirsupport on views
about the usual nature of regulatoryfailure;and it would of course be
possible to accept some of the principleswhile rejectingothers.
Notwithstandingtheirnumberand variety,moreover,thevariousnormsare
united by certaingeneral goals. These include, above all, the effortto
promote deliberationin government,to furnishsurrogatesforit when
it is absent,to limitfactionalismand self-interestedrepresentation,and
to help bringabout politicalequality.All of the normsare responsiveto
an understandingof the various reasons forstatutesand of the various
ways thattheytend to fail in practice.Of course it would be necessary
to develop rules of priorityand harmonizationin cases of conflict.
Illustrations
1. The DelaneyClause.-I have referredto the Delaney Clause, which
prohibitsthe sale of food additivesthat "induce cancer when ingested
by man or animal" or are found "aftertestswhich are appropriate for
the evaluation of the safetyof food additives,to induce cancer in man
and animal." As we have seen, the draftersof the clause believed that
few additivescaused cancer and that those thatdid so were extremely
dangerous. By the 1980s, however,it was clear that many substances
were carcinogenic,but that a number of them created exceptionally
minorrisks.These substancesincludednaturaldietaryconstituentpsosing
dangers thatsurpass those of artificialchemicals.</p>
      <p>These developments severelyundermined the assumptionsof the
Congress thatenacted the Delaney Clause, and indeed made it appear
quite perversein manyof itsapplications-banning as itdid substances
that posed littleor essentiallyno riskto health. One consequence was
thatmanufacturers,havingbeen forbiddento use food additivesposing
a de minimisriskof cancer,used instead additivesthatcaused farmore
serious risksof other diseases-thus creatingwhat is quite possiblya
significanitncreasein illnessesand deathsfromfoodadditives.In response,
the Food and Drug Administration(FDA)-invoking
backgroundprinciples against obsolescence and in favor of de
minimisexceptionsinterpretedthe clause to permitexemptionsof trivialrisks.It said that
it would approve food additivesthatposed a de minimisriskof cancer.</p>
      <p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Districtof Columbia
held that the FDA's position was unlawful.'7 In the court's view, the
Delaney Clause was simplyunambiguous on the point. But this
interpretationwas farfrominevitable.Read in itscontext,therewas no such
clarityC.ongresssimplydid notfocuson thequestionofde minimisrisks.
It is farfromclear thatthe court'smechanicalreadingof the statutewas
sensiblefromthe perspectiveof itsoriginalauthors,whose assumptions
simplydid not hold in the 1980s. The background against which the
Delaney Clause was writtenwas so differentfrompresentcircumstances
thatthe statutoryterms"induce cancer" mustbe treatedas ambiguous.
Whethera substance"induces" cancer withinthe meaningof the clause
mightwell be a functionof the degree of riskthat it posed. In these
cirumstancesi,nterpretatioonf the clause to permitde minimisexceptions
seems quite consistentwithpermissibleunderstandingsofjudicial
interpretationand quite sensibleto boot. The court'sdecisionto thecontrary
was thereforemisguided.
2. Pennhurst.-In PennhurstStateSchooland Hospitalv. Halderman,'8a
group of mentallyretarded people brought suit against a facilitythat
was found to contain dangerous conditions.Many of the residentshad
been physicallyabused, brutallymistreated,or drugged; and the facility
was utterlyinadequate forthe habilitationof the retarded.As the basis
of their legal claim, the plaintiffsinvoked the "bill of rights"in the
DevelopmentallyDisabled Assistanceand Bill of RightsAct.'9 The bill
of rightscontained a set of legislativefindings,includingthe following:
1. Personswithdevelopmentadlisabilitiehsavea righttoappropriate
treatments,ervicesa,nd habilitatiofnorsuchdisabilities.</p>
      <p>2. The treatments,ervicesa,nd habilitationfora
personwithdevelopmentaldisabilitiesshouldbe designedto maximizethedevelopmental
potentiaolf thepersonand shouldbe providedin a settingthatis least
restrictivoeftheperson'spersonaliberty.</p>
      <p>3. The FederalGovernmenatnd theStatesbothhavean obligationto
assurethatpublicfundsare notprovidedtoanyinstitutio.n.. thatdoes
notprovidetreatments,ervicesa,nd habilitatiownhichis appropriateto
theneedsofsuchpersons.</p>
      <p>The question in Pennhurstwas whether the bill of rightscreated
legallyenforceablerightsor whetherit instead set out a set of goals or
aspirations that could not be vindicatedin court. Whether the bill of
rightswas legallyenforceablewas an uncertainissue in lightof the text</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-16">
      <title>Normsand StatutorIynterpretation 819</title>
      <p>and historyof the act. Withouta backgroundinterpretiveprinciple,the
case was probablyimpossibleto resolve.</p>
      <p>In holdingforthe governmentaldefendant,theSupreme Courtdid
not deny thatthe conventionalsources of interpretationleftthe case in
equipoise. Instead it invoked a backgroundnorm: "If Congress intends
to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys,it must do so
unambiguously.By insistingthatCongress speak witha clear voice, we
enable the States to exercise their choice knowingly,cognizant of the
consequences of their participation."Pennhurstwas thus decided as a
resultofan interpretivneormthatwasa resultoftheCourt'sunderstanding
of the constitutionalbackground-a norm thatcould not be connected
to the statuteat issue in the case.</p>
      <p>For reasons explored above, federalismprinciplesare
properlyinvoked, at least in ordinarysettings,to require a clear statementfrom
Congress forthe impositionof significantdutieson the states.If the bill
of rightshad been held legallyenforceable,the stateswould have faced
an enormous financialburden, one that they had not, in view of the
ambiguityofthestatute,necessarilyagreedtoincur.But twoconsiderations
suggestthatPennhurswtas incorrectlydecided. First,federalismprinciples
have much less forcein cases in whichCongressis attemptingto protect
a traditionallydisadvantaged group fromthe politicalprocesses of the
states. Here the ordinarypresumption in favor of state autonomy is
countered by the history and implementation of the fourteenth
amendment-a self-consciouslimitationon state power. Invocation of
principlesof state autonomy in the contextof a sociallysubordinated
group-to justifya narrowreading of a statuteenacted on
itsbehalfis positivelyperversein lightof constitutionalstructureand history.</p>
      <p>Second, an underenforcedconstitutionalnorm calls foraggressive
constructionof statutesinvolvingthedevelopmentallydisabled.The Court
has been extremelycautious in using the Constitutionto protectthe
disabled, largelyforinstitutionalreasons. In holdingthatthe equal
protectionclause does notentitlethementallyretardedto special protection,
forexample, the Court stressedthatfederaland statelegislatureshave
in fact responded to the pervasive mistreatmentof the retarded,and
that courts should be reluctantto intrude in so dramatic a way into
democratic processes.20In these circumstances,it remains possible to
argue thatthe best substantivetheoryof the equal protectionclause in
factaccordsspecialprotectiontothedisabled,and thatwhenotherbranches
give such protection,theyare carryingout
theirconstitutionalresponsibilities.</p>
      <p>It followsthatwhen Congress has takenstepsto providesafeguards
forthat group, the Court should take into account the underenforced
characterof the equality norm in order to give statutesinvolvingthe
disabled a hospitableratherthan grudginginterpretationI.t is puzzling
indeed thatthe PennhurstCourt relied on a backgroundnorm in favor
of federalismin a case involvinga group and a rightsafeguardedbythe
fourteenthamendment.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-17">
      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>Because language "by itself"is withoutmeaning, and in light of the
existence of gaps or ambiguitiesin hard cases, interpretivenorms of
various sorts are indispensable-desirable and in any case inevitable.
Statutoryinterpretationcannotgo forwardwithoutbackgroundprinciples
that orient reader to text,fillgaps in the face of legislativesilence, or
provide the backdrop againstwhichto read linguisticcommands. Some
such principlesaid courtsin discerningthe meaningof particularstatutes,
or help toimplementCongress'sactual or likelyinterpretiveinstructions;
othersarerootedin constitutionacloncerns;othersarebasedon assessments
of institutionaplerformance;and stillothersattemptto respond to
characteristicfailingsof regulatorylegislation.In all of theserespects,norms
of statutoryconstruction,far frombeing obsolete or representingan
illegitimatejudicial value judgment, mustoccupy a prominentplace in
the theoryand practiceof statutoryinterpretation.</p>
      <p>The ultimatetaskis to develop a set of interpretivenormsor
backgroundunderstandings-sensitiveto constitutionasltructurei,nstitutional
design,the New Deal reformationa,nd thediversefunctionsand failings
of governmentalactorsand statutoryregimes-with whichto approach
social and economic regulationin a systemthathas largelyabandoned
common law categories.And itis possible to generatea seriesof norms,
all with support in currentlaw, that can help accomplish some of the
goals of deliberativegovernmentin the post-New Deal period. In this
way,statutoryconstructioncan serveas an allyof other,more ambitious
strategiesdesigned to promotesome of the originalconstitutionalgoals
in a dramaticallychanged legal environment.It is fartoo muchto expect
statutoryconstructionto respond to all of the failingsof the regulatory
state.But itis not too much to expect thatthe processof interpretation
can make the situationbetterratherthan worse.</p>
