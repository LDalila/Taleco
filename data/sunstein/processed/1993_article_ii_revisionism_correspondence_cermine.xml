      <p>One of the most striking developments of the last decade has been
the new use of Article II in public law adjudication.</p>
      <p>Article II is a
prominent feature not only of cases involving the creation of federal
institutions that are independent of the President,' but also of new
disputes involving reviewability, scope of review, and standing. 2 It is
especially interesting that some key standing cases, nominally decided
under Article III, have an unambiguous root in a distinctive
understanding of Article II.3 Thus it is suggested that certain grants of
to citizens, taxpayers, or others without an individuated
would compromise the vesting of executive power in the
President and the grant of power to the President, rather than to
courts or to citizens, to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully
exe</p>
      <p>Article II appears to be doing much of the crucial work in
the key Article III cases, and Justice Scalia's powerful dissenting
opinion in Morrison v. Olson 5 may be enjoying a surprising rebirth in the
law of standing.</p>
      <p>All this suggests that Professor Krent and Mr. Shenkman have
performed a valuable service in spelling out the argument that Article
II, rather than Article III, justifies constitutional limits on legislative

grants of standing. 6 Indeed, on several important matters, we are very
much in agreement. We agree that Article III forbids courts from
hearing cases in which the plaintiff has no cause of action, but that,
under Article I, Congress can create causes of action whenever it
chooses. 7 We agree that the citizen suit, while consistent with Article
III, has a mixed record as a matter of simple policy 8 We agree that
Article II poses no barrier to suits in cases involving individuated
injuries, even when a beneficiary of a regulatory program is seeking
greater enforcement of the law.9 I also want to emphasize that Krent
and Shenkman have put their finger on a key but underanalyzed
feature of the recent standing decisions.</p>
      <p>In this brief space, I will be unable fully to come to terms with

8. Id at 1803-04.</p>
      <p>9. Id. at 1805-06. On this score it is illuminating to compare Lujan to the striking decision
in Northeastern Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. Contractors v. Jacksonville, 61 U.S.L.W. 4626
(U.S. June 14, 1993). Jacksonville had enacted an ordinance requiring that 10% of the money
spent on city contracts be "set aside" for minority business enterprises. A contractors'
association, consisting mostly of members who would not qualify as minority enterprises, brought suit,
claiming that the set-aside violated the Equal Protection Clause. The lower court denied
standing on the ground that no member of the association had demonstrated that, "'but for the
program, any AGC member would have bid successfully for any of these contracts."' 61 U.S.L.W.
at 4627 (quoting Northeastern Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. Contractors v. Jacksonville, 951
F.2d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir. 1992)). There was therefore no injury in fact.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court responded:
When the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for members of one group
to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another group, a member of the former group
seeking to challenge the barrier need not allege that he would have obtained the benefit but
for the barrier in order to establish standing. The "injury in fact" in an equal protection
case of this variety is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the
barrier, not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit. And in the context of a challenge to
a set-aside program, the "injury in fact" is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the
bidding process, not the loss of a contract. To establish standing, therefore, a party
challenging a set-aside program like Jacksonville's need only demonstrate that it is able and
ready to bid on contracts and that a discriminatory policy prevents it from doing so on an
equal basis.
61 U.S.L.W. at 4629 (citations omitted). In an intriguing footnote, the Court added, "[i]t follows
from our definition of 'injury in fact' that petitioner has sufficiently alleged both that the city's
ordinance is the 'cause' of its injury and that a judicial decree directing the city to discontinue its
program would 'redress' the injury." 61 U.S.L.W. at 4629 n.5.</p>
      <p>There is serious tension between Lujan and Associated General Contractors In Lujan, the
injury could have been recharacterized in opportunity-like terms, and, in that event, there would
have been no problem with injury in fact, causation, or redressability. Indeed, there is real
tension between Associated GeneralContractorsand many of the cases denying standing, including
Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737 (1984), Simon v. EKWRO, 426 U.S. 26 (1976), and Linda R.S. v.
Richard D., 410 U.S. 614 (1973). For a general discussion, see Cass R. Sunstein, What's
Standing After Lujan? Of Citizen Suits, "Injuries," and Article II, 91 MIcH. L. REv. 163, 193-95
(1992). A prime goal of standing doctrine for the next few years should be to explain when
injuries can be characterized narrowly and when broadly. In my view, the question should turn
on legislative instructions. See id at 234-35. See also Cass R. Sunstein, StandingInjuries, 1993

their understanding of Article II. I will try, however, to indicate why
that understanding seems to be quite adventurous as a matter of
constitutional history and structure. In the end, I suggest that their
conception of Article II amounts to a form of constitutional revisionism,
in the interest of judgments of policy and fact that are plausible but
that lack sufficiently clear constitutional roots to be invoked by courts.</p>
      <p>Let me begin with a brief outline of the basic argument. Krent and
Shenkman contend that Article II reflects a commitment to a unitary
executive, and that the grant of citizen standing fatally compromises
that commitment. 10 In their view, it is the President who is entrusted
with the authority to oversee all implementation of federal law.1 This
idea stems from the constitutional judgment that there should be
political accountability for the redress of "public harms," that is, harms
shared by the public as a whole.' 2 The political process is the
appropriate, and indeed the exclusive, check on inadequate redress of these
harms. 13</p>
      <p>To be sure, people with individuated interests can bring suit
against executive illegality, even if the illegality amounts to insufficient
enforcement of the law. "Privately accountable relators," however,
are altogether different. Under Article II, they should not be allowed
to bring suit against either private defendants acting in violation of the
law14 or against the executive itself. This principle applies even if
Congress creates bounties for citizens.' 5 If citizens lacking
individuated interests were permitted to bring suit, they would undermine the
forms of political accountability that are guaranteed by the system of
unitariness in execution of the laws. It is for this reason that Article II
bans the citizen suit.</p>
      <p>This reasoning is indeed an understanding of Article II; but is it an
understanding with real roots in the Constitution, one that federal
judges should invoke in order to invalidate federal statutes? I am
skeptical. First, a conceptual point: Krent and Shenkman lean very
hard on the distinction between individuated and nonindividuated
harms. This distinction seems quite problematic to me, not because
there are hard line-drawing problems - although there are 16 - but
10. Krent &amp; Shenkman, supra note 6, at 1794-96.
11. I at 1794.
12. See infra notes 14-16 and accompanying text on this distinction.
13. Krent &amp; Shenkman, supra note 6, at 1801-04.</p>
      <p>14. In this respect, Krent and Shenkman answer a question not resolved in Lujan, a question
that I believe the Court would resolve the other way. See Sunstein, supra note 9, at 231-33.
15. The same comment made supra in note 14 applies here. See id at 232-33.
16. Part of the reason lies in the difficulty of deciding how to characterize the harms. See
supra note 9.
because the distinction may not be workable for the purposes to which
Krent and Shenkman seek to use it. The key point is that we cannot
decide whether an injury is individuated in the abstract; this
determination depends on whether the law has defined it as individuated. If
Congress can enact law to decide whether injuries are individuated, it
may ensure that injuries that were once nonindividuated are now in
fact individually held, and it may grant standing to individuals to
vindicate those interests.</p>
      <p>
        The point may seem exotic and abstract, but it is perfectly familiar.
In a system without private property, for example, property is publicly
owned, and no one can claim that "his" property is at stake. There
are no individuated ownership rights and hence no individuated
harms. It is only when the law creates property rights that
individuated injuries begin to exist. So, too, there is no individuated right to
many regulatory benefits, such as clean air, when the law has allowed
the benefit to be unowned. But once government has (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ) created
private ownership rights or a joint tenancy in the relevant benefit and (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        )
said that these rights may be vindicated in court, the case is quite
different. Once the government has created ownership rights, the
interest has become individuated in the legally relevant sense.
      </p>
      <p>Of course there are differences between public and nonpublic
goods. Perhaps Krent and Shenkman mean to argue that some public
goods - things owned by all or many - cannot give rise to standing.
But to some extent the very difference between public and nonpublic
goods is an artifact of law. Whether a good is public depends at least
partly on whether the government has said that it can be owned
privately. In any case, I do not think that the differences between public
and nonpublic goods have constitutional status for purposes of
standing. It is not clear why Congress should be disabled from granting
each of us a kind of property right in a certain state of affairs - even if
many or all of us share that right - and from saying that each of us is
entitled to vindicate that right in court.</p>
      <p>Let me put the conceptual issues to one side and return to the
Constitution. As Krent and Shenkman are aware, 17 their understanding of
Article II has no support in the history of Article II. In fact, early
constitutional practice strongly argues against this understanding. 18
Citizen suits were authorized before, during, and shortly after the
founding, and there is no evidence that anyone thought that they
17. See Harold J. Krent, Executive Control Over CriminalLaw Enforcement: Some Lessons
from History, 38 AM. U. L. REv. 275, 302 (1989); Krent &amp; Shenkman, supra note 6, at 1803 &amp;
n.38.</p>
      <p>18. Sunstein, supra note 9, at 168-79.
raised the slightest question under Article II. Criminal law
enforcement by citizens is a well-established device in Anglo-American law. 19
Even if some forms of citizen enforcement of the criminal law might
be constitutionally troublesome, we are dealing here with civil actions,
where the historical evidence cuts very hard against the invocation of
Article II.</p>
      <p>More broadly, I think that the notion of a "unitary executive"
needs a good deal more elaboration, certainly in terms of its complex
history. The Framers did believe in a unitary executive; but they did
not think that this belief entailed the further view that the President is
in charge of all implementation of the laws. In fact, they allowed
Congress considerable power to structure implementation as it saw fit.20
We know, for example, that in the period after the Founding, much
prosecution under federal law took place without presidential
control.2 1 Neither the President nor the Attorney General controlled the
district attorneys. Citizens could enforce federal law in state court.
Moreover, both the Comptroller General and the Postmaster were
immunized from the general control of the President.</p>
      <p>In these circumstances, the alleged constitutional commitment to a
strongly unitary executive - a president who was to be in charge of
all of what we now call implementation of the law - seems to me to
have been greatly oversold. Ifjudges are to be bound by history, or to
give history a good deal of weight, it is necessary to reject the Article
II argument against citizen standing.</p>
      <p>I do not contend that the historical evidence is decisive. Perhaps it
would be possible to develop a structural argument for an exclusive
presidential role in law implementation. 22 Let us suppose that such an
argument can be made. Even if it can, it does not support the view
that Article II bans suits brought by people without individuated
interests. The key point is that there is no difference between the
interference with that exclusive role in cases in which the plaintiff has an
individuated interest and the interference with that role when the
plaintiff has no such interest.</p>

Lessig &amp; Sunstein, supra note 20, make a structural argument stressing changed circumstances
but the argument is too narrow to jeopardize the citizen suit.
[Vol 92.131</p>
      <p>Imagine, for example, that the plaintiffs in Lujan 2 had purchased
airline tickets to the areas in which endangered species were at risk.
In that event, they would unquestionably have had a sufficient "injury
in fact" to challenge the failure to apply the Endangered Species Act
extraterritorially. But if they had airline tickets, would they
compromise Article II concerns any less? I do not believe so. Along the
Article II dimension, there is no difference between citizen suits and suits
by people with individuated interests. If suits against the executive by
people with individuated interests do not violate Article II - as
everyone agrees - it is hard to see why the same suits violate Article II
merely because of the absence of an individuated interest.</p>
      <p>In any case, it is far from clear that citizen suits really compromise
any constitutional commitment to presidential exclusivity in
implementing the law. 24 We should distinguish here between citizen suits
against private defendants and citizen suits against the government
itself. If the government is not implicated, we have a civil supplement
to public enforcement efforts, corresponding to the ordinary and
timehonored parallel systems of public and private law. Tort law and
criminal law usually work hand in hand, allowing private and public
suits founded on similar complaints, such as assault, battery, theft, and
so forth. The creation of a citizen suit against private violators builds
on this most conventional of models. I do not see how the
Constitution's structural commitments forbid this model.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the citizen suit will interfere a bit with the government's
overall enforcement scheme by, for example, allowing an action when
the executive has exercised prosecutorial discretion so as to exempt a
violator. 5 It is not simple, however, to explain how this interference
would violate Article II, any more than civil actions in state court
violate state constitutions because such actions interfere with the
criminal prosecutor's power to enforce the criminal law. Because the
government is not a party, I cannot see why the citizen suit against private
defendants creates a problem under Article II, especially if, as noted,
an identical suit from someone with an individuated interest does not
create any such problem. The disruption of the President's law
enforcement authority is the same in either case. This point suggests
that we are back to Article III and that Article II is irrelevant after all.

L REv. (forthcoming 1993) ("Litigation on behalf of the polity is shared with private citize in
the United Kingdom and many states (which even today allow private prosecution), and the
survival of qui tam actions, veterans of the eighteenth century, shows that litigation has never
been a prerogative confined to executive officials.").</p>
      <p>25. See Krent &amp; Shenkman, supra note 6, at 1803.</p>
      <p>The issue is somewhat different in suits brought by citizens against
the government. Perhaps there is an Article II problem if a court says
that the executive must act in a certain class of cases. To come to
terms with this claim, it is necessary to see what exactly the court will
decide and what will be at stake. If the citizen suit is to go forward,
the question for judicial decision is whether the relevant agency has
violated federal law in circumstances in which the law dictates action
of a certain kind. The court has no authority to issue a judgment
because of a policy disagreement; it must find illegality.26 If the agency
has violated the law, the court will so hold and issue an appropriate
decree. The question is this: Why, precisely, do such suits raise an
Article II issue?</p>
      <p>The problem does not arise under the "Take Care" Clause. By
hypothesis, the President will win in court if he has "taken care" and
lose only if he violated that duty. It is not so easy to see why the
"Take Care" Clause forbids courts from ordering the President to
carry out the law. Indeed, Krent and Shenkman do not really believe
that the clause forbids courts from doing this. They believe that, when
an individuated injury is at stake, a decree to this effect raises no
Article II problem.27 Again: if Article II allows courts to interfere with
law implementation by ordering the President to "take care" at the
behest of a plaintiff with an individuated injury, why does Article II
offer a freestanding objection to such an order at the behest of a
citizen? No good reason comes to mind.</p>
      <p>If this reasoning is right, the vesting of executive power in the
President seems to add nothing to the problem raised by citizen suits.
This clause does not bar the courts from issuing decrees calling for the
legally required enforcement of the law at the behest of people with
individuated injuries. If it does not, it is unclear how the clause
supplies a barrier when citizens bring suit. Of course, the distinction
between individuated and nonindividuated injuries grows out of Article
III cases, in which it is understandable if misguided (as Krent and
Shenkman agree2 8). The unanswered question remains why that
distinction is crucial for purposes of Article II. Perhaps the response is
that the President should be accountable only to the public as a whole
when individuals are not peculiarly affected, and when any particular
litigant stands basically for everyone. This position is fully
under26. Under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837
(1984), the agency receives the benefit of all reasonable doubts.</p>
      <p>27. Krent &amp; Shenkman, supra note 6, at 1816-17.
28. See iUt at 1806-07.
standable as a matter of policy, but it does not seem to be more than
that.</p>
      <p>In the end, the structural claim at issue here amounts to a
proposition that the abstract interest in political accountability, grounded in
Article II, forbids Congress from allowing citizens to sue either private
people acting in violation of the law or executive officials who are
defaulting on their legal obligations. This claim raises many puzzles. If
we are concerned about political accountability, the argument seems
strained. It is after all Congress, the national lawmaker, that has by
hypothesis decided in favor of citizen suits, and Congress is
accountable for its actions. Moreover, there is at the very least an apparent
democratic failure whenever a bureaucracy fails to do what Congress
has prescribed. Surely Congress could conclude that the citizen suit
provides both an ex ante deterrent and an ex post corrective to this
unfortunate result. For these reasons, it seems a bit mysterious to say
that the interest in political accountability forbids Congress from
granting citizens standing to supplement or to correct agency illegality
in enforcement.</p>
      <p>One final point. As the last generation of constitutional law has
made clear, there is a thin line between structural arguments having a
genuine constitutional source and policy judgments belonging in the
political process. If judges are going to strike down enactments of
Congress on constitutional grounds, they should be reasonably
confident that a real constitutional commitment underlies this result, and
that the commitment does not mask instead a controversial set of
policy recommendations. The aggressive use of Article II to prevent
Congress from creating citizen suits seems to run afoul of this
principle. It is not as if the claim has absolutely no connection to something
in the Constitution; but the connection is much too attenuated to
justify invalidation of federal statutes. This is my basic reaction to the
imaginative recent use of Article II in the law reviews and the
Supreme Court.</p>
