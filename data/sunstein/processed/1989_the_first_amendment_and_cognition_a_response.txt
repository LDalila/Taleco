THE FIRST AMENDMENT  AND  COGNITION:
A  RESPONSE

CASS  R.  SUNSTEIN*

I am grateful to the editors of the Journal for inviting me to reply  to
Professor Chevigny's  thoughtful  response'  to my essay  in these  pages. 2  I
find  myself in  agreement  with much  of Professor  Chevigny's  argument.
A purely  Cartesian  account  of human thought  would  indeed be hard  to
sustain.  Human  beings  do  not  approach  problems  linearly  or  through
propositions  alone.  Drives,  selective  empathy  and  identification,  heuris-
tics  of various  sorts,  prior  experience'and  beliefs,  desires,  recognizable
patterns,  and various  verbal  and nonverbal  cues  also  play  a  crucial role.
Moreover,  much speech  with noncognitive  components  is  entitled  to the
highest degree of constitutional protection.  Political speech,  for example,
frequently  appeals  to  the heart  as  well as  to  the head.  The  fact  that an
appeal is  emotionally loaded  is hardly a good reason  to allow the govern-
ment  to  control it.

Notwithstanding  these  points,  it  would,  I  think,  be  a  mistake  to

abandon  the  view  that  some  narrowly  defined  categories  of  speech-
threats,  involuntary  hypnosis,  and  most  notably,  for  present  purposes,
pornography-merit  less than the usual protection,  and precisely  because
of  the  way  these  kinds  of speech  communicate  their  "message."  My
claim comes in two simple  parts.  (1) Some narrowly  drawn categories  of
speech  may  be  regulated  on  the basis  of  a  lesser  showing  of  harm-a
proposition  that is  in  fact  a  staple  of current  first  amendment  doctrine.
(2)  To  decide  whether  speech falls  within  those  categories,  it  is relevant
whether the material  in question  appeals to  cognitive or noncognitive  ca-
pacities.  I arrive  at this  conclusion  through two  different  routes.

First:  I think Professor  Chevigny  overstates  his  case.  The  distinc-
tion between  cognitive and noncognitive  speech is not "dangerously  inco-
herent."' 3  Indeed,  Professor  Chevigny's  own  terms  suggest  that  he
believes  that the distinction is  intelligible,  at least in the important sense
that it is  possible  to  identify polar  cases.  For  example,  he distinguishes

between  "the  most  professorial"  and  the  "most  'intuitive'  ,,;4  between
"propagandistic  persuasion"  and  other  kinds  of  thought;5  between
"prejudgments  ... in  patterns"  and  "logic"; 6  between  "arous[al]"  and
"abstract"  argument. 7  To  be  sure,  Professor  Chevigny  often  invokes
these  distinctions  to  suggest  that  they  are  less  crisp  and  clear  than  we
normally  recognize-a  claim  I accept-but  it  is  hard  to  read  his  essay
without  getting  the  sense  that  it  would  be  difficult  indeed  to  proceed
without  distinctions  of  this  general  sort.  For  this  reason,  Professor
Chevigny's  colleague  is  on  to  something  true  and  important  when  she
says, in response to his essential argument, that  what makes pornography
different  is  that people  "get  off on  it."  But more  on  this below.

More fundamentally,  the proposition  that  "our judgments  [appear]
'detached'  or contemplative,  but they are as much rooted in our prejudg-
ments  as  are  snap  decisions," 9  is  not  merely  a  counsel  of despair.  This
proposition-to  which  I  very  much  doubt  Professor  Chevigny  entirely
subscribes-is  also  antithetical  to  the  basic  logic  of a  system  of free  ex-
pression,  which places  a  high premium  on  the  process  of discussion  and
deliberation  among  people  with different  views.  If judgments,  contem-
plative judgments,  snap judgments,  and  prej.dgments  are  essentially  all
one,  it will  not be  easy  to  specify  the  sorts  of values  our system  of free
speech should  serve.  Indeed,  common  practices of deliberation,  commu-
nication,  change in  perspective,  and learning  will  be  hard  to  sustain.

In  any  case,  Professor  Chevigny's  effort  to  collapse  the  distinction
between the cognitive  and noncognitive  is emphatically  not  the lesson  of
the various  writings  on  which he relies.  Those writings  convey  no single
message, but make a variety  of quite distinct claims,  some of them funda-
mentally  at  odds  with  Professor  Chevigny's  position.  Either  separately
or  together, they  do  not  support  Professor  Chevigny's  effort  to  collapse
the distinction  between  reasoned judgments  and  bare  intuition. 10

breaks  down, or is compromised,  in  different  settings; they  do not identify  the snap  decision  with the
considered judgment,  or suggest  that  the cognitive/noncognitive  distinction  is  incoherent.  Indeed,
the exact  opposite is  true:  the introduction  to the very  volume  on  which  Professor  Chevigny  relies

REPLY  TO CHEVIGNY

An  effort  to  collapse  the  distinction  between  the  cognitive  and
noncognitive  would also be wildly untrue to  human experience,  in which
prejudgments  and  uninformed  intuitions  are  subject  to various  forms  of
testing  and reassessment  during the process  of making  a decision."1   The
most obvious examples here involve means-end rationality  of the simplest
sort,  in  which  people  ask  themselves  whether  a  particular  course  of
action  will  in  fact  produce  the  goals  they  seek,  or  whether  there  are
superior  alternatives.  It  would  be  peculiar  to  denigrate  the  role  of
"logic"  here,  and  snap judgments  are  often  reassessed.  Modern  social
science,  moreover,  has  provided  extremely  helpful  information  on  such
issues.12  The  cognitive  testing  of prejudgments  occurs  in other  contexts
as  well.  Values 
themselves  emerge  partly  through  a  process  of
deliberation.

All  this  suggests  that  the  distinction  between  the  cognitive  and
noncognitive  is not  incoherent;  we can  distinguish  between  forms  of ex-
pression  based  on  their  appeal  to  different  capacities.  To  say this  is not
to deny that communication  frequently  involves noncognitive  elements, 13
and it is  not to claim that communication  is ever purely cognitive  or that
the presence of noncognitive  elements  removes  speech  from first  amend-
ment protection. 14  Indeed, the cognitive/noncognitive  distinction should
arise only infrequently  in first amendment  cases,  as  in fact it does. 15  But
the  question  remains  whether  first  amendment  doctrine  ought  to  treat
some  forms  of speech-threats,  assaults,  some  pornography--differently

says  that some  such  heuristics  "lead  to severe  and  systematic errors."  Id. at 3.  A  considered judg-
ment necessarily  depends on a belief in  logic,  and that belief underlies  most of the modern  work  in
social  psychology  on  heuristics  and  biases.  See  also J. ELSTER, SOLOMONIC  JUDGMENTS  ch.  1
(1989)  (discussing  breakdowns  in rationality).

I  cannot deal  with  Professor  Chevigny's  various  other  sources  in  this  space,  but  one  of the
mistakes  in  his  analysis,  I  think,  is  to  take  what  is  an  essentially  descriptive  work  about  mental
processes-showing  various cognitive breakdowns  and complexities-as  support for the quite differ-
ent claim that  moral  or constitutional  theory  ought not to distinguish  between the cognitive and  the
noncognitive,  or  that such  a distinction  is  "incoherent."  Chevigny, supra note  1, at 422.

11.  See  J. RAWLS,  A THEORY  OF  JUSTICE  48-51  (1971)  (discussing  reflective  equilibrium,  the
state reached  "after a person has weighed  various proposed  conceptions and  he has  either revised his
judgments  to accord  with  one of them or held  fast  to his initial  convictions  (and  the corresponding
conception)).  Education  in  general,  including  legal  education,  involves  precisely  these  sorts  of
processes.  See  M.  NUSSBAUM,  THE  FRAGILITY  OF  GOODNESS:  LuCK  AND  ETHICS  IN  GREEK
TRAGEDY  AND  PHILOSOPHY  (1985).

12.  Thus,  for example,  regulation  of the environment and  of occupational  safety and  health-

not  to  mention  pornography-should  be  based  on  a  careful  understanding  of the likely  effects  of
different  enforcement  strategies.  See,  eg.,  Rose-Ackerman,  Progressive Law  and Economics-and
the New  Administrative Law, 98 YALE  L.J. 341,  354-60 (1988)  (well-informed  policy  analysis demon-
strates that occupational safety  and health regulations  poorly  achieve democratic government's  goals
of redistribution  and  aid  to  working  people).

from others because  of the way  they communicate  their message;  and  it is
to  this question  to  which I now  turn.

Second:  Those  interpreting  the  first  amendment  must  distinguish
between  activities  that  count  as  "speech"  and  those  that  do  not.  That
task is hard  enough,  but a system of free expression  must also distinguish
between  speech  that  is  and  is  not  central  to  the  purposes  of  the  free
speech  guarantee.  This latter task-to  set out  categories  of "low  value"
and "high  value"  expression-is  crucial to modern  first amendment doc-
trine;  indeed, judge-made  doctrine  could  hardly  function  without  it. 16

Unless I misread him, Professor Chevigny's  approach  would make it
difficult  or  impossible  to  distinguish  between  activities  that  count  as
speech  and activities  that  do not;  his  approach  also  would  make  it hard
to  distinguish  between  low-  and  high-value  speech.  I  am confident  that
Professor Chevigny would  not claim that a long look at a rock formation,
a visit  to  a prostitute, or  a summer vacation  in  Paris,  count as  constitu-
tionally  protected  speech-but  all  of these  activities  are  subject  to  pre-
cisely  the  same  sorts  of mental  intermediation  that Professor  Chevigny
treats  as  characteristic  to  all forms  of speech.  If so,  Professor  Chevigny
will be forced  either to assimilate  a quite dazzling range  of activity  to the
category  of  constitutionally  protected  speech-an  implausible  innova-
tion, I think,  on  existing doctrine-or  to  rely  on  the discredited  and un-
tenable  distinction  between  "speech"  and  "conduct."' 7

In brief, the first  amendment  makes  it necessary  to  identify the  dis-
tinctive characteristics  entitling "speech,"  and not  other forms of human
experience,  to  constitutional  protection.  Any  approach  that  refuses  to
undertake  such a task will be  at best incomplete  and more  likely  a mud-
dle.  And  any approach  that does  undertake  this task will  probably con-
clude  that  speech 
is  protected  at  least  partly  because  it  involves
cognition.  In the public realm,  cognition-understood  to involve  deliber-
ative  capacities  of  a  wide-ranging  sort-provides  a  central  clue  to  the
American  commitment  to  self-government  through  political  processes;
and  it  is  here  that  a  central  purpose  of  the  first  amendment  can  be
found.'  However  oversimplified  the  Enlightenment  understanding  of

danger  if first  amendment  is  to  serve  its  central  function  of ensuring  open  political  process  and
dialogue).

these problems  might be,  I remain  unconvinced  that a sensible system  of
free  expression  must  treat  violent  pornography  in  the  same  way  that it
treats  political  speech,  or the works  of Albert Einstein. 19
