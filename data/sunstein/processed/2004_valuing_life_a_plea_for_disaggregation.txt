VALUING  LIFE: A PLEA FOR
DISAGGREGATION

CASS  R. SUNSTEINt

ABSTRACT

Each government  agency  uses  a  uniform figure  to  measure the
value  of a statistical life  (VSL).  This  is  a  serious mistake.  The  very
theory that underlies current practice calls for far more individuation
of  the  relevant values.  According to  that theory,  VSL  should  vary
should  vary  across
across  risks.  More  controversially,  VSL 
individuals-even or especially if  the  result would  be  to  produce a
lower  number  for  some  people  than  for  others.  One  practical
implication is  that a higher value  should be  given  to  programs that
reduce cancer risks. Another is that government should use  a  higher
VSL for programs that disproportionately benefit the wealthy-and a
lower VSL  for programs that disproportionately benefit the poor. But
there  are two  serious complications here. First, bounded rationality
raises problems  for  the  use  of private  willingness  to  pay,  which
underlies current calculations of  VSL.  Second,  the  beneficiaries of
regulation sometimes  pay  only  a  fraction or even  none  of its  cost;
when this is so, the appropriate VSL for poor people might be higher,
on  distributional grounds,  than  market  evidence  suggests.  An
understanding of this point has implications for foundational issues
about government regulation, including valuation of persons in poor
and wealthy nations.

INTRODUCTION

For over  two decades,  executive  orders  have  required  regulatory
agencies  to  engage  in  cost-benefit  analysis  of  major  regulations,'  and
Congress  has  imposed  similar  requirements  in  several  statutes.2  To

and benefits  of the  use  of any  pesticides"); Toxic Substances  Control Act,  15 U.S.C.  § 2605(c)(1)

VALUING  LIFE

conduct  cost-benefit  analysis,  agencies  must  assign  monetary  values
to  human  lives  that  are  potentially  saved  by  a  proposed  regulation.
How  do  they  come  up  with  the  numbers  that  they  use?  Do  some
deaths  count for more than others?

The  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  uses  a  uniform
value  for  a  statistical  life  (VSL):  $6.1  million?  Other  agencies  use
numbers  that  are both  higher  and  lower  than the EPA's  VSL,  with  a
range,  in  recent  years,  between  $1.5  million  (the  Federal  Aviation
Administration 
the  Food  and  Drug
in  1990')  and 
Administration's  (FDA's)  current  figure  of  $6.5  million.  Although
substantial  differences can  be found across  agencies,6 uniformity  is the
intended  practice  within  each  agency.7  No  agency  treats  cancer  risks,

(FAA) 

(2000)  (mandating  that  the  administrator  consider  and  publish  a  statement  documenting  the
effects,  benefits,  and economic  impacts  of proposed  toxic  substance  regulations);  Safe  Drinking
Water  Act, 42  U.S.C. § 300g-l(b)(3)(c)  (2000)  (requiring  the documentation  of quantifiable  and
nonquantifiable  costs and  benefits in  the establishment  of maximum  contaminant  levels).

3.  National  Primary  Drinking  Water  Regulations;  Arsenic  and  Clarifications 
to
Compliance  and  New Source  Contaminants  Monitoring,  66 Fed. Reg.  6976,  7012  (Jan. 22,  2001)
(codified  at 40 C.F.R. pts.  9, 141,  and 142).  I refer  throughout to  uniform  numbers, but this is  of
course  a  simplification.  There are  differences  across  agencies,  and  within  agencies  practices  are
variable  over  time  and  across  regulations.  By  referring  to  a  uniform  number,  I  mean  that
regulatory  agencies  do not distinguish  among risks  or among  protected classes,  so as  to  produce
the  variations  that  I  emphasize  here.  Within  regulations,  uniform  numbers  are  used,  and when
disparate  numbers  are used  across  regulations,  it  is  not because  of  a judgment  about  different
risks  or different protected  classes.

In its  July  2003  regulation  governing  food  labeling  of  trans-fatty  acids,  the  Food  and
Drug  Administration  used a VSL of  $6.5  million.  Food  Labeling:  Trans Fatty  Acids in Nutrition
Labeling,  Nutrient  Content  Claims,  and  Health  Claims,  68  Fed.  Reg.  41,434,  41,489  (July  11,
2003)  (codified  at 21  C.F.R.  pt. 101).  In  its March  2003  proposed  rule  on dietary ingredients  and
dietary  supplements,  the  same  agency  suggested  a  VSL  of  $5  million.  See  Current  Good
Manufacturing  Practice  in  Manufacturing,  Packing,  or Holding  Dietary  Ingredients  and Dietary
Supplements,  68 Fed.  Reg.  12,158,12,229  (proposed  Mar.  13,  2003)  (to  be  codified  at 21  C.F.R.
pts.  111,  112)  (using this value  to calculate the  "value  of a  statistical life day").

4.  The  Department of Transportation  now uses a  higher  figure, but  one  that is  still lower
than the  VSL  used  by most  agencies.  See Brake System  Safety Standards  for  Freight and  Other
Non-Passenger  Trains  and Equipment;  End-of-Train  Devices, 67  Fed. Reg.  17,556,  17,560  (Apr.
10,  2002)  (codified  at 49  C.F.R. pt. 232)  (recording  the  Department  of Transportation's  VSL  as
$2.7  million).
5. 

Infra Table  1;  see  Matthew  D.  Adler  &  Eric  A.  Posner,  Implementing  Cost-Benefit
Analysis When Preferences Are Distorted, 29  J. LEGAL  STUD.  1105,  1146  (2000)  (comparing  the
"valuations  of life"  advanced by  multiple  agencies).
6.  These differences  seem  inexplicable.
7.  See  Adler  &  Posner,  supra note  5,  at  1122-23  (explaining  that  an  agency's  use  of  "a
constant  figure  for the  monetized value  of life"  is one  means of correcting  for  wealth  distortions
in  individual  preferences).  There  are  some  differences  within  agencies  across  contexts  and
across  time,  but  those  differences  do  not seem  deliberate.  See  supra note  3  (comparing  VSLs
both within  and  across agencies).  The  most explicit discussions  of varying  VSLs  have  come  from

[Vol.  54:385

or  other  mortality  risks  that  produce  unusual  fear  or  involve  special
suffering,  as  worthy  of more  concern  (and  a  higher  valuation)  than
other  risks.  No  agency  contends  that  distinctive  values  should  be
assigned  to  the  risks  associated  with  airplane  deaths,  motor  vehicle
deaths,  or  deaths  from  defective  children's  toys.  No  agency  treats
young  people  as  worth  more  than  old  people.8  No  agency  values  the
lives  of  poor  people  less  than  the  lives  of  rich  people.  No  agency
distinguishes  between  whites and  African  Americans  or between  men
and women. For statistical  lives,  the  governing  idea is that  each  life  is

the  EPA. In  its  2003  discussion  of hazardous  air  pollutants,  National  Emission  Standards  for
Hazardous  Air  Pollutants  for  Industrial/Commercial/Institutional  Boilers  and  Process  Heaters,
68 Fed.  Reg. 1660  (proposed Jan. 13,  2003)  (to be  codified at 40 C.F.R. pt. 63), the EPA noted:
There  is general  agreement  that the value  to  an  individual  of a  reduction  in mortality
risk can  vary  based on  several  factors,  including  the  age of the individual,  the  type of
risk,  the  level  of control  the  individual  has  over  the  risk,  the  individual's  attitude
toward  risk, and the health  status of the  individual.

Id.  at  1695.  Nonetheless,  the  agency  announced,  without  explanation,  that  it  "prefers  not  to
draw  distinctions  in  the  monetary  value  assigned  to  the  lives  saved  even  if they  differ  in  age,
health  status, socioeconomic  status,  gender or other characteristic  of the adult  population."  Id.

An  extended  discussion  of related  issues  can  be  found  in  the  EPA's  arsenic  proposal,
National  Primary  Drinking Water  Regulations;  Arsenic  and  Clarifications  to Compliance  and
New  Source  Contaminants  Monitoring,  65  Fed.  Reg.  38,888  (proposed  June  22,  2000)  (to  be
codified  at  40 C.F.R. pts. 141,  142).  In this proposal, the EPA  noted that  the

factors  which  may  influence  the  estimate  of  economic  benefits  associated  with
avoided  cancer  fatalities  include  (1)  a  possible  'cancer  premium'  (i.e.,  the  additional
value  or  sum  that  people  may  be  willing  to  pay  to  avoid  the  experiences  of dread,
pain and suffering,  and diminished quality  of life associated  with cancer-related  illness
and  ultimate  fatality);  (2)  the  willingness  of people  to  pay  more  over  time  to  avoid
mortality  risk as  their income  rises;  (3)  a  possible  premium  for  accepting  involuntary
risks as  opposed  to  voluntary  [sic] assumed  risks;  (4) the  greater  risk  aversion  of the
general  population  as  compared  to  workers  in  the  wage-risk  valuation  studies;  (5)
'altruism'  or the  willingness  of people  to  pay  more  to  reduce  risk  in  other sectors  of
the population;  and  (6)  a  consideration  of health status and  life years remaining  at  the
time  of premature mortality.

Id. at  38,945.  The  EPA  acknowledged  that  these  factors  "may  significantly  increase  the present
value  estimate,"  but  said  that  "there  is  currently  neither  a  clear  consensus  among  economists
about how  to  simultaneously  analyze  each  of these  adjustments nor  is there  adequate  empirical
data  to  support  definitive  quantitative  estimates  for  all  potentially  significant  adjustment
factors."  Id. Hence  the  EPA solicited  comments  on  these  issues  and said  that  it  would  ask  its
Scientific  Advisory  Board  (SAB)  to  conduct  a  review.  Id. As  noted  below,  the  comments
produced  a  sensitivity  analysis  that  contains  several  upward  adjustments  from  the  $6.1  million
figure,  see  infra note  100  and  accompanying  text,  but the  SAB's review  suggested  that  at  the
present  time, upward  adjustments  were  not justified  by existing  evidence,  see infra note  141  and
accompanying  text.

8.  With  the  interest  in  focusing  on  "life-years,"  however,  this  might  change.  See  Cass  R.
Sunstein,  Lives,  Life-Years,  and  Willingness  to  Pay, 104  COLUM.  L.  REV.  205,  206  (2004)
("[G]overnment  should  consider not simply.  ..  the  VSL; it should  concern  itself also or instead
with  the  number  of life-years  at  stake,  or the  value  of statistical  life-years  (VSLY).  At  the  very
least, the number of statistical  life-years  is a more precise  measure  of what is involved.").

VALUING  LIFE

worth exactly  the  same.  With  respect  to cost-benefit  analysis, much  is
disputed.9 But on  the idea  of a uniform value  per life  saved, there  is a
solid consensus,  at least  in terms of regulatory practice.'0

The  stakes  are  exceedingly  high.  If  cost-benefit  analysis  is  the
basis  for  the  ultimate  decision  to  approve  or  reject  a  proposed
regulation,  everything  turns  on  the  selected  VSL.  If  an  agency  uses  a
VSL  of, say, $15  million,  many more  regulations will  be justified  than
if  it  uses  a  VSL  of,  say,  $2  million.  And  if  a  uniform  number  is
rejected,  the  pattern  of  justified  regulations  will  shift  dramatically.
Some  existing  regulations  will  be  revealed  as  too  weak,  and  more
stringency  will  be  required;  others  will  seem  too  aggressive  and  will
have  to  be  weakened  or  even  eliminated.  If agencies  shifted  to  using
VSLs  that  varied  along  one  or  more  variables,  the  regulatory  system
would look very different  from how it does  today.

In  this  Article,  I  intend  to  question  the  consensus  in  favor  of  a
uniform  VSL,  and  to  do  so  in  a  way  that  raises  foundational  issues
about the  economic  valuation of human  lives. I  suggest that a uniform
value  is obtuse. Under the very  approach  that  agencies use to  produce
the  current  numbers,  VSL  should  vary  along  two  dimensions.  VSL  is
calculated  based  on  people's  willingness  to  pay  (WTP)  to  avoid
particular  risks,  and  if  WTP is  particularly  high, VSL  will  be  high  as
well.  For  two  reasons, VSL  should  be  expected  to  be  highly  variable,
in  a way that makes  a uniform number senseless.

9.  See  generally FRANK  ACKERMAN  &  LISA  HEINZERLING,  PRICELESS:  ON  KNOWING
THE  PRICE  OF EVERYTHING  AND  THE  VALUE  OF  NOTHING  (2004)  (attacking  the  very  practice
of assigning  dollar  values  to lives  and health  as  part  of cost-benefit  analysis);  W. KIP  VISCUSI,
FATAL TRADEOFFS:  PUBLIC  AND  PRIVATE  RESPONSIBILITIES  FOR RISK  (1992)  (suggesting that
the  government  should  "respect  citizens'  preferences"  in  assigning  valuation  and  thus  should
consider  subjective  valuation  in  cost-benefit  analysis,  even  when  such  valuation  is  irrational);
Adler  &  Posner, supra note  5,  at  1106  ("The  problem  with  the  traditional  definition  of  [cost-
benefit  analysis]  in  terms  of  actual  preferences  is  that  satisfaction  of  actual  preference  and
maximization  of well-being  are  not  equivalent....  Cost-benefit  analysis can  be redefined  as the
sum  of welfare equivalents....").

10.  An  arguable exception,  noted  above,  involves the  debate  over  whether agencies  should
focus  on  lives  or instead  life-years;  the latter  approach  might well  value  older  people  less  than
younger  ones.  For  discussion,  see  Sunstein,  supra note  8,  at  205.  Professor  W.  Kip  Viscusi
implicitly  challenges  the  consensus,  stating:  "The  current  approach  of  ignoring  length-of-life
issues  creates  inequities  by valuing  the  life  of a  person  with  . . . a 6-month  life  expectancy  the
same  as  a  ...  person  with  a 40-year  life  expectancy."  W.  Kip  Viscusi, Risk  Equity, 29 J. LEGAL
STUD.  843,  870  (2000).  W.  Kip  Viscusi  and  Joseph  E. Aldy  note  the  existence  of heterogeneity
by  income,  union  status,  and  age,  and they  explain  that  the  "existence  of such  heterogeneity
provides  a  cautionary  note  for  policy."  W.  Kip  Viscusi  &  Joseph  E.  Aldy,  The  Value  of a
Statistical Life:  A  Critical Review  of Market  Estimates  Throughout the  World,  27  J.  RISK  &
UNCERTAINTY  5,7  (2003).

[Vol.  54:385

First,  VSL  should  vary  across  risks.  For  example,  people  are
willing  to pay  high  amounts  to  avoid  cancer  risks, and  hence  there  is
reason to think  that people's VSL  is higher  for cancer  deaths than for
sudden,  unanticipated  deaths."  Cancer  risks  are involved  in the  work
of  many  regulatory  agencies,  and  people  seem  to  be  particularly
concerned  about  such  risks,  in  a  way  that  should  produce  a  high
VSL-almost  unquestionably  higher  than  the  values  that  agencies
now  use.  More  generally,  deaths  that  produce  unusual  fear,'2  or  that
are  accompanied  by  high  levels  of  pain  and  suffering,  should  be
expected  to  produce  a  higher  VSL.  Human  beings  face  countless
mortality  risks,  and it  would  be  truly  bizarre  to maintain  that  people
value  avoiding  each of those risks identically.

Second,  VSL  should  vary  across  individuals,  simply  because
different  people  are  willing  to  pay  different  amounts  to avoid  risks.
People  who  are  risk  averse  will  be  willing  to  pay  more,  and  will
therefore  show  a  higher  VSL,  than  people  who  are  risk-seeking.'"
Those  who  are  rich will  show a  higher  VSL  than  those  who  are  poor.
People  who are  thirty might well  show a higher VSL  than people who
are  sixty."  It  follows  that  different  demographic  groups  will  show
diversity in  their  VSLs as well.'6

11.  See James K.  Hammitt  & Jin-Tan Liu, Effects of Disease Type and Latency on the Value
of Mortality Risk, 28  J.  RISK & UNCERTAINTY  73,  80  (2004)  ("The  value  of preventing  a  fatal
cancer  is  often  considered  to  be  greater  than  the  value  of  preventing  a  fatal  trauma  in  a
workplace  or transportation  accident.").

12.  For  evidence  of  a  higher  VSL  for  airline  risks  than  for  automotive  risks,  see  Fredrik
Carlsson  et  al.,  Is Transport Safety  More Valuable in the  Air?, 28 J. RISK & UNCERTAINTY  147,
148  (2004)  ("There  are  several  reasons  why  individuals  would  be  willing  to  pay  more  for  the
same risk  reduction when  traveling by air compared to  by other  transport  modes, such as  car or
train.").

13.  See  Viscusi  &  Aldy, supra note  10, at  18  ("[T]ransferring  the  estimates  of a  value  of a
statistical  life  to  non-labor  market  contexts,  as  is  the  case  in  benefit-cost  analyses  of
environmental  health  policies  for  example,  should  recognize  that  different  populations  have
different  preferences over risks and different  values on  life-saving.").

14.  See Carlsson  et al.,  supra note  12,  at  158  (finding  that  people  who  are scared  of flying

are willing  to pay especially high  amounts to reduce  the  risks associated  with  flying).

15.  See  JOSEPH  E. ALDY  & W. KIP  VISCUSI,  AGE  VARIATIONS  IN  WORKERS'  VALUE  OF
STATISTICAL  LIFE  I  (Nat'l Bureau of Econ. Research, Working  Paper  No. 10199,2003)  ("[Olne
might  expect  that older individuals may value  reducing risks  to their  lives  less because  they have
shorter remaining  life expectancy.").

16.  Such  differences  are  found  in  W.  Kip  Viscusi,  Racial Differences in  Labor Market
Values of a Statistical Life, 27  J. RISK  & UNCERTAINTY  239,  252 tbl.5  (2003).  To get a  bit ahead
of the story:  I  am not  arguing that government  should  assign  a higher VSL to  white  lives  than  to
African-American  lives.  I  am  speaking  here  of  demographic  differences  that  would  emerge
from  a  fully  individuated  approach  to  VSL,  in  which  each  person's  WTP was  calculated  on  an
individual  basis.  Once  these  values  are  aggregated,  the  white  VSL  would  likely  be  higher  than

VALUING  LIFE

If  these 

two  forms  of  variability-across  risks  and  across
persons-are  put together, it will be clear  that the unitary $6.1  million
figure  used  by  the  EPA  is  far  too  crude."  Each  person  in  society  is
willing  to  pay  a  distinctive  amount  to  avoid  each  risk.  It follows  that
in  theory,  each  person  should  have  a  particular  VSL  for  each  and
every  risk,  resulting  in  a  fully  individuated  VSL. s  Such  a  fully
individuated  VSL  would  mean,  for  example,  that  agencies  would
value  avoidance  of  cancer  risks  more  highly  than  many  other
mortality  risks-and  that  the VSL  of  some racial  groups  would  likely
be  lower than  that of  others.19  But  the latter  differences  would  not be
the result of a governmental  decision  to take racial  characteristics  into
account;  in  fact  it  would  not  be  a  product  of  any kind  of group-level
discrimination  on  the  government's  part.0  The  differences  would  be
the  result  of  aggregating  the  VSLs  calculated  for  each  individual.

the  African-American  VSL,  simply  because  of disparities  in wealth  and  income.  Richer  people
pay  more  for  safe  cars  and  smoke  alarms  than  poor  people  do.  See  infra text  accompanying
notes  17-21.
17. 

I  use  the  EPA's  $6.1  million  VSL  throughout  as  a  convenient  example  of  a  unitary
figure,  but the  analysis  applies  equally  to  any  agency's  unitary figure,  and to  uniformity  across
agencies.
18. 

I  am putting  to one side the  complication  that values sometimes  are constructed,  rather

In  a  sense  Professor  Viscusi  is  correct;  there  is  no  reason  to  think  that  African-American
workers  have  an  intrinsically  greater  predisposition  to  take  risks.  But  in  the  market,  one's
willingness  to  bear  risks  is  a  product  of  "market  opportunities,"  and  hence  those  with  fewer
opportunities  will  show  a greater willingness  to bear  risk.

Such  aggregation  occurs  today  in,  for  example,  ordinary  consumer
markets  that  price  reduction  of  the  statistical  risks  associated  with
smoke  alarms, unusually safe  cars, and  much more.2

In  practice, of course,  a fully individuated  VSL is not feasible,  for
two  different  reasons.  First,  government  lacks  the  information  that
would  permit  the  calculation.  Regulators  do  not  know  how  much
each  person  would  be  willing  to  pay  to  reduce  each  statistical  risk;
generalizations  through  the use  of categories  are  therefore  inevitable.
Second,  many  regulatory  programs  involve  collective  goods  and
protect  many  people  at  once.  A  clean  air  program,  for  example,
cannot  easily  ensure  that  some  people  in  a  geographical  region  are
exposed  to no  more than  10 parts  per billion  (ppb)  of some pollutant,
while  others  in  the  same  region  are  subjected  to  50  ppb.  Because
collective  goods  are  typically  involved  in  regulation,  the  problem  is
pervasive.  When  government  is  providing  a  regulatory  good  to  many
people  at  once,  feasibility  requires  that  it  use  a  single  VSL,  not  a
range  of VSLs.

Notwithstanding  issues  of  feasibility,  an  understanding  of  the
reasons  for  individuating  VSL is  important  for two  reasons.  The  first
involves  conceptual  clarity.  The  theory  behind  the  use  of  VSL  and
WTP  remains  poorly  understood.  In  brief,  VSL,  as  currently
understood,  is  a product  of agency  judgments  about  people's WTP  to
reduce  or eliminate  certain  risks. When a  particular VSL  is used  (say,
$6 million),  it  is  because  the  agency  estimates  that  people  are  willing
to  pay  a  certain  amount  to  reduce  statistical  risks  of  a  specified
magnitude.  This  point  should  be  enough  to  show  that  whatever
terminology  agencies use,  there is no  "value  of a statistical  life";  there
are  only  values  for the  reduction  of statistical  risks."  Once  regulators
identify  the  real  question  as  the  identification  of  those  values,  they
will  find  it  difficult  to  defend  a  unitary  VSL,  simply  because  there  is
no  such  thing.  An  appreciation  of  the  case  for  individuation  will
clarify the  theory-both  its rationale  and  its limitations, empirical  and
ethical.  I  emphasize  that  the  theory  is  undergirded  by  considerations

of  both  autonomy  and  welfare-and  that  those  considerations  also
show when  the use  of WTP  to calculate  VSL is misguided.

The  second  reason  involves  the  possibility  of  moving  a  long  way
toward  greater  individuation,  even  if full individuation  is  not feasible.
With  respect  to  the  reduction  of  cancer  risks,  for  example,  there  is
reason  to  believe  that  people  are  willing  to  pay  an  extra  amount;
hence VSL, based  on WTP, is  significantly  higher than  studies of risks
not  involving  cancer  suggest."  For  this  reason,  the  government's
current  valuation  of  cancer  risks  is  probably  too  low,  resulting  in
widespread  underprotection  of the public. Similarly,  there is reason  to
think  that  VSL  should  be  higher  for  mortality  risks  from  airplanes
than  for statistically  identical  risks  on the  highways. 2'  More  generally,
different  agencies,  dealing  with  qualitatively  different  risks,  might
well  use  different  VSLs,  simply  because  market  evidence  is  likely  to
show  just  those  differences.25  Full  individuation  is  not  feasible,  but
greater  individuation  would  be  quite  easy.  The  result  would  be
different  judgments  from  agencies,  simply  because  new  VSLs-some
higher,  others  lower-would  produce  different  conclusions  about
when regulation  is justified.

A  far  more 

troublesome  problem,  to  which  I  will  devote
considerable  attention,  involves  disparities  along  demographic  lines.
For  now,  notice  a  simple  factual  point:  WTP  is  dependent  on  ability
to pay, and  those  with little income  and  wealth  will show little  WTP. 26
It  follows  that  the  VSL  of  poor  people,  when  calculated  based  on
WTP, will  be lower  than  the VSL of  rich people, simply  because  poor
people  are  poorer.  Suppose  that  the  $6.1  million  figure  used  by  the
EPA  represents  the  average  WTP  of  a  population-wide  sample.
When  risks  are  faced  disproportionately  by  wealthy  people,  VSL,

24.  See Carlsson,  supra note  12,  at  148  (finding  that individuals'  VTP to  reduce  the  risk of

airline deaths  is more  than double their  WTP to  reduce  the risk of taxi deaths).

25.  As  I  explain  in  Part  I.A,  different  agencies  now  use  different  numbers  for  VSL,  but
these  differences  seem  random  and do  not stem from  a careful  inquiry  into the  questions  that  I
am emphasizing here.

26. 

If  the tax  laws  ensured the  right  level  of redistribution,  there  would  be  little  reason  to
use  regulatory  policy  to  promote redistributive  goals.  Regulation  would  be  based  on WTP, and
tax  laws  would  ensure  such  redistribution.  Hence  the  analysis  of  VSL  and  WTP  would  be
different  with  an  optimal  tax  policy  from  what  it  must  be  without  such  a  policy.  If  tax  policy
were optimal,  a highly  variable WTP  would  be  appropriate  and  there would  be  no  need  to take
account  of distributional  concerns.  The  discussion  below  is  based  on the  assumption  that  more
redistribution  is desirable  and  that  regulatory  policy  can  sometimes  help  to  promote  that  goal,
though  less effectively  than an optimal tax.

based  on  actual  WTP,  should  be  higher  than  $6.1  million-just  as  it
should  be lower when  the regulated  risks  are faced  disproportionately
by  poor people."  It is  inevitable  that  people  in  poor nations  will  have
a lower  VSL than people  in rich  nations,  a point  with implications  for
valuation  of  the  harms  from  global  warming."  Similarly,  people  in
poor  areas  will have  a  lower VSL than  those  in wealthy  areas,  a point
with  implications  for  valuation  of  a  variety  of  risks  in  the  domestic
setting.  If  variations  across  risks  and  persons  are  significant,  the
question  of  individuation  should  be  a  central  part  of  the  second
generation  of  cost-benefit  analysis-a  step  beyond 
first-
generation  debate  about whether to  do such  analysis  at all,  and  a  step
toward  doing  such  analysis  in  a  way  that  is  more  refined  and  more
closely  attuned  to  the consequences  of regulations  in  terms of  choice,
welfare,  and distributional equity.

the 

Of  course  it  is  offensive  and  wrong  to  suggest  that  in  principle,
poor  people  are  "worth  less"  than  rich  people.  If  poor  people  are
subject  to  a risk  of 1/10,000,  they do  not have  less of  a claim  to  public
attention  than wealthy people  who are  subject to the same risk; in fact
they may  have a  greater  claim, if only  because  they  lack  the resources
to  reduce  that  risk  on  their  own.  But  the  topic  here  is  regulation
rather  than  subsidy,  and  the  two  ought  not  to  be  confused.  In
principle,  government  should  not  force  people  to  buy  protection
against  statistical  risks  at  a  price  that  seems  excessive  to  them.29  At
least  as  a  general  rule,  people  should  not  be  required  to  pay  $70  to
reduce  a risk of 1/100,000  if they  are  willing to pay no  more than  $50.

If  a  uniform  VSL  would  benefit  the  poor,  there  is  a  strong
argument for a  uniform VSL. But regulation  based  on  a uniform VSL
may  or  may  not  produce  a  more  equitable  distribution  of  income;  in
fact  any  redistribution  may  be  perverse,  and  a  single  VSL  might not
promote  equality  at  all.' °  And  if  poor  people  are  forced  to  pay  an
their  WTP,  desirable
amount  for  risk  reduction

people  would voluntarily  reject,  are  not  a  good  way  of  redistributing

assigning  them  a higher  VSL, then  there  is  a good  argument  for  assigning  them  a  higher  VSL. I

If wealthy  people  are  the principal  beneficiaries  of a  particular  regulation  chosen on the
basis  of  a  uniform  VSL,  and  if  the  public  as  a  whole  pays  for  it,  then  any  redistribution  will
benefit  the wealthy,  not the poor.

wealth to  the disadvantaged.  (Requiring poor people  to buy  Volvos is
not  the most  sensible  means  of assisting  them.)  On  the  other hand,  it
is  possible  that  some  regulatory  programs,  based  on  a  uniform  VSL,
will  help those in  need, if their  beneficiaries  receive  risk  reduction  for
which  they  pay  little  or  nothing-an  issue  to  which  I  will  devote
considerable  attention.

A  larger  lesson  follows  from  this discussion.  For purposes  of  law
and  politics, there  is  no sensible  answer  to the abstract  question  about
the  correct  monetary  value  of  human  life.  Any  judgment  about  the
individuation,  must  be  heavily
appropriate  VSL,  and  about 
pragmatic;  it must  rest on  the consequences  of one  or  another  choice.
Whether  government  should  use  a  higher  or  lower  VSL  across
important
demographic 
implication  involves  the  assessment  of  VSL  across  nations.  A  poor
nation would  do well  to  adopt  a lower  VSL than a  wealthy nation;  for
China  or  India, it would be  disastrous  to use  a VSL equivalent  to  that
of the  United  States  or  Canada.  But this point should  not  be  taken  to
support  the  ludicrous  proposition  that  donor  institutions,  both  public
and  private,  should  value  risk  reduction  in  a  wealthy  nation  above
equivalent risk reduction  in a poor nation.

the  heart  of  the  Article,  explores 

This  Article  is  organized  as  follows.  Part  I  clarifies  the  theory
behind  the  valuation  of  statistical  lives.  The  major  point  is  that
regulators  do  not really  use  a  VSL;  instead  they  use  a  mean  WTP to
eliminate  a  statistical  risk.  For  example,  agencies  might say  that  they
are using a VSL of $6 million, but when they  do so,  they are relying on
evidence  more  or  less  establishing  that  the  average  person  is  paid
$600  to  face  a  risk  of  1/10,000.  The  case  for  using  this  evidence
depends  on  considerations  of both  autonomy  and  welfare.  Part  II,  in
the  need  for
some  ways 
individuation  across  both  risks  and  persons.  Part  III  offers  a  more
ambitious  discussion  of  the  uses  and  limits  of  WTP  in  regulatory
policy.  It distinguishes  between easy  and hard  cases for  using WTP to
calculate  VSL.  The  central  claim  in  Part  III  is  that  the  argument  for
using  WTP  is strongest  when  the  beneficiaries  of regulation  must pay
all  of its  cost-though  even  in  that  event,  the  argument  is  subject  to
important  qualifications,  above  all  involving  bounded  rationality.  The
is  weaker  when  the  beneficiaries  of
argument  for  using  WTP 
regulation  pay  only  a  fraction  of  that  cost.  When  this  is  so,  some
people  will benefit  from  regulation even  if it is inefficient  in  economic
terms.  I  discuss  the  implications  of  this  point  for  a  uniform  or fully
individuated  VSL. Part IV turns  to global regulation  and  the  question

HeinOnline  -- 54 Duke L.J. 395 2004-2005

DUKE LAW JOURNAL

[Vol.  54:385

of cross-national  differences  in VSL. My conclusion  is  that while  third-
party  donors  should  help  those  people  who  need  help  most,  without
reference  to  lower  VSLs  in  poor  countries,  governments  in  wealthy
nations should  use a higher VSL than governments  in poor ones.

I.  WTP:  THEORY AND  PRACTICE

in
I  begin  with  an  explanation  of  existing  agency  practice 
calculating  VSL  and  of  the  theory  that  underlies  it.  As  discussed
below,  agencies  calculate  VSL  on  the  basis  of  market  evidence  of
WTP.  Agencies  are  not really  able  to identify  a  "value  of  a statistical
life";  instead  they  take  advantage  of  information  about  how  much
people  are  willing  to  pay  for  facing  statistical  risks.  I  suggest  that
considerations  of  both  welfare  and  autonomy make  it  reasonable  for
agencies  to  consult  WTP.  Unfortunately,  many  questions  might  be
raised  about the  numbers that agencies  now use.

A.  Agency Practice

It  has  now  become  standard  for  regulatory  agencies  to  assign
monetary  values  to  human  lives.  Consider  the  following  table,  which
captures  several examples  of agency practices  from 1996 through  2003:

evidence  of  compensation  levels  for  actual  risks.5  In  the  workplace
and  in  the  market  for  consumer  goods,  additional  safety  has  a  price;
market  evidence  is  investigated  to  identify  that  price. 2  The  second
kind of  evidence  comes  from  contingent  valuation  studies,  which  ask
people  how  much  they  are  willing  to  pay  to  reduce  statistical  risks.3
The  EPA's  $6.1  million  figure,  for example,  is  a  product  of studies  of
actual  workplace  risks;  such  studies  attempt  to  determine  how  much
workers  are  paid  to  assume  mortality  hazards. 4  The  relevant  risks
usually  are  in  the  general  range  of  1/10,000  to  1/100,000."5  The
calculation  of  VSL  is  a  product  of  simple  arithmetic.  Suppose  that
workers must  be paid  $600,  on  average,  to assume  a  risk  of  1/10,000.
If so, the VSL  would be  said to be  $6  million.

to  accept"  (WTA)  in  regulatory  policy. 58 

A  large  advantage  of  labor  market  studies  of  this  kind  is  that
they  avoid  the  lively  disputes  over  the  use  of  "willingness  to  pay"  or
"willingness 
In  many
contexts,  in  both  experiments  and  the  real  world,  people  demand
more  to give  up  a  good than  they are  willing to  pay to  obtain  it in  the
first  instance-a  disparity  that  significantly  complicates  efforts  to
assign  monetary  values  to  regulatory  benefits,  including mortality  and
morbidity. 9  If people  are  willing  to  pay  $25  to  eliminate  an  existing
risk  of  1/100,000,  but  demand  $100  to  incur  a  new  risk  of  1/100,000,
then  it  is  difficult  to know  how  to  proceed  for purposes  of monetary
valuation  of  risks.  Should  agencies  use  $25,  $100,  or  some
in  the
intermediate  figure?  Fortunately,  this  problem  dissipates 
context  of labor market  studies. If workers  who face  a risk of 1/10,000
are  paid  $600  more  for  doing  so,  and  if  workers  who  refuse  to  face
such  a  risk  are  paid  $600  less,  then  it  is  irrelevant  whether  agencies
speak  in terms of WTP  or WTA.

B.  Of Welfare and Autonomy

Why  do  regulators  care  about  market  valuations  of  statistical
two  possible  answers.  The  first  and  more
involves  welfare.  The  second  and  perhaps  more

risks?  There  are 
conventional 
interesting  involves  autonomy.

In  economic terms,  these valuations provide  a  clue  to the  welfare
consequences,  for  individuals,  of  one  or  another  outcome.  If  people
are  willing  to  pay  $60,  but  no  more,  to  eliminate  a risk  of  1/100,000,
then  it  can  be  reasonably  assumed  that  their  welfare  is  increased  by
asking  them  to pay  that  amount-and  that  their  welfare  is  decreased
by  asking  them  to  pay  more.  There  are  many  demands  on  people's
budgets,  and  if they  prefer  not  to spend  more  than $60  to  eliminate  a
risk  of  1/100,000,  it  may  be  because  they  would  like  to  use  their
money  for  food,  shelter,  recreation,  education,  or  any  number  of
other  goods.  With  respect  to  mortality  risks, it is  possible  that people

are  sometimes  inadequately  informed,  and  there  might  be  reason  to
override  their  judgments.  But  so  long  as information  is  available,  the
welfare  argument is straightforward. 6°

Perhaps  regulatory  policy  should  not  be  based  on  welfare;
perhaps  it is  unclear what  "welfare"  really  means,  and  WTP  might  be
defended instead  on the ground  of personal autonomy.6  On  this view,
people  should  be  sovereign  over  their  own  lives,  and  government
should  respect  personal  choices  about  how  to  use  limited  resources
(again  so  long as those choices  are  informed). When  people  decline  to
devote  more  than  $60  to  the  elimination  of  a  1/100,000  risk,  it  is
because they would  prefer  to  spend the money  in  a way  that seems to
them  more  desirable.  If  regulators  do  not  use  people's  actual
judgments,  then  they  are  insulting  their  dignity.  The  use  of  WTP
therefore  can  claim  a  simultaneous  defense  from  both  utilitarian  and
deontological  accounts.

C.  Questions and Doubts

Nonetheless,  some questions might  be raised  about the  use  of the
relevant  studies by  the EPA  and  other  agencies. 62 Most obviously,  the
studies  show  significant  variety  in  the  crucial  numbers,  ranging  from
$16.3  million  in  1988  to  $.7  million  in  1991.  The  EPA has  adopted  the
$6.1  million  figure  on  the ground  that  it represents  the  median  in  the
relevant  studies. 63  But there  is  a  risk  of  arbitrariness  in  fastening  on
that  median  figure,  particularly  if there  is  no  reason  to  believe  that
the  relevant study  is  the most  accurate.  In  fact a  more general  look  at
the  VSL  data  produces  further  puzzles  and  wider  ranges.  Some
studies  find  no  compensating  differentials  at  all,  indicating  a  VSL  of
low,  to  say  the  least,  for  purposes  of  policy.

Others find  that nonunionized  workers  receive negative compensating
differentials  for risk-that  is, they  appear  to be  paid  less because  they

face  mortality  risks.65  Another  study  finds  that  African  Americans
receive  no  significant  compensating  wage  differential  and  hence  that
their  particular  VSL  is  zero.6  On  the  other  hand,  some  studies  find
VSLs  actually  above  the  VSLs  presented  in  Table  1;  consider  the
finding  that for  people  who  choose jobs  with  low  level  risks, the VSL
is as much  as  $22 million. 7

The  most  recent  metastudy,  far  more  comprehensive  than  the
EPA's  own  analysis,  finds  that  most  studies  produce  VSLs  ranging
from  $3.8  million  to  $9  million.'  The  range  is  fairly  compressed,  in  a
way  that  disciplines  agency  decisions;  for  many  regulations,  the
"bottom  line"  of the  cost-benefit  assessment  will  not be  affected  by a
choice  of  $3.8  million  or  $9  million.  But  that  range  still  leaves
significant  room  for  discretion,  in  a  way  that  would  have  significant
implications  for  policy and  law.  Consider  the  fact  that the  monetized
value  of  a  program  that  saves  two  hundred  lives  would  range  from
$760 million to $1.8 billion;  note  also that the EPA's highly publicized
arsenic  regulation  would  easily  fail  cost-benefit  analysis  with  a  $3.8
million VSL but  easily pass  with a  $9 million VSL.69 The  simple  point
is  that  the  variety  of  the  outcomes  raises  questions  about  the
reliability of any particular  figure.

In  addition,  most  of  the  studies  on  which  the  EPA  relies  are
based  on  data  from  the  1970s. 70  Since  that  time,  there  has  been
significant growth  in  national income."  This  change  suggests  that  any
VSL derived  from  1970s  data  is  too  low.  Of course  people  with more
money  are  expected  to  be  willing  to  pay  more,  other  things  being
equal, to  reduce  statistical  risks. One  study finds that  at the beginning
of the twentieth  century, VSL  was  about $150,000  in current  dollars-
less  than  one-twentieth  of the corresponding  amount  a century later."

produced  a  significant  undervaluation  of  the  monetary  value  of  the
lives  at stake; the $6.1  million figure  reflects  no  adjustment  to account
for  changes  in  national  real  income  growth.73  In  principle,  the  failure
to  undertake  an  adjustment  is  a  serious  mistake.  The  actual  mean
WTP might be  substantially higher.74

Even  more fundamentally,  the  relevant  numbers  deserve respect
only  if they  do  not  result  from  bounded  rationality  or  an  absence  of
information  on  the  part of  the  people  whose  choices  generate  them.
Suppose,  for  example,  that  workers  do  not  know  the  risks  that  they
face  or that their decisions  are products  of the availability  heuristic  or
optimistic  bias.7"  In  either  case,  regulators  should  not  use,  for
purposes of policy,  a  finding that workers  are paid $60 to run a  risk of
1/100,000;  by  hypothesis,  that  number  does  not  reflect  a  rational
tradeoff  by  informed  workers.  I  return  to  these  points  below.76
Current  practice  is  based  on  an assumption,  not  that all  or even  most
workers make  informed  choices,  but that market processes ensure  the
right  "price"  for various degrees  of safety.77 Compare pricing for soap,
cereals,  and  telephones:  most consumers  do  not have  full information
and  use  heuristics  that  lead  them  astray,  but  market  competition
produces a sensible  structure  of prices,  at least most of the time.

D.  The Value of Statistical Risks, Not the Value of Statistical Lives

Suppose  that  the  relevant  problems  can  be  solved  and  that
regulators  can  identify  a  number,  call  it  $6  million,  that  really
represents  people's  valuations.  It  should  be  clear  that  even  if  this
were  so,  it  would  be  grossly  misleading  to  offer  the  following
suggestion:  The  value  of a  statistical life  is  $6  million.  It  would  be
much  more  accurate  to say that for risks  of 1/10,000,  the median  WTP
in  the  relevant  population  is  $600-or that  for  risks  of  1/100,000,  the
median  WTP  is  $60.  If  true,  these  statements  would,  on  assumptions
later  explored,  be  extremely  helpful  for  purposes  of  policy. But  even
at  first  glance,  it  is  clear  that  these  numbers  need  not  be  taken  to
support  a  VSL  that  is  independent  of  probability."8  Suppose  that
people  would be  willing to  pay $60  to reduce  a risk  of 1/100,000. From
this  it  does  not  automatically  follow  that  people  would  be  willing  to
pay  $6  to  eliminate  a risk  of 1/1,000,000,  or  $6,000  to  reduce  a  risk  of
1/1,000,  or  $60,000  to  reduce  a  risk  of  1/100.  It  is  plausible  to  think
that  people's  WTP  to  reduce  statistical  risks  is  nonlinear. 9  As  the
probability  approaches  100  percent,  people  become  willing  to  pay  an
amount  for  risk  reduction  that  rises  nonlinearly  to  100  percent  of
their  wealth;  as 
risk  approaches  zero,  WTP  nonlinearly
approaches  nothing.  For  a  risk  of  1/1,000,000,  for  example,  many
reasonable  people  would  be  unwilling  to  pay  anything,  treating  that
risk as  inconsequential.

the 

Hence  the claim that VSL is  $6  million is merely  a shorthand  way
of saying  that people  are  willing  to pay  from  $600  to  $60 to eliminate
risks  of  1/10,000  to  1/100,000.  Because  this  is  the  range  for  risks  with
which  most  agencies  deal,  the  relevant  data  are  highly  informative.
For current  purposes, this  point is the crucial  one.

II.  INDIVIDUATION

My  basic  claim is  that  VSL will  inevitably  vary  across  both  risks
and  persons. If people's  WTP is higher  to  avoid cancer  risks than  risks
of unanticipated,  sudden  deaths,  then  the  use  of  a  VSL,  drawn  from
studies  of  the  latter  risks,  will  provide  insufficient  protection  of  the
exposed  population.  If  people  in  different  occupations  are  paid

78.  See  RICHARD  POSNER,  CATASTROPHE:  RISK  AND  RESPONSE  166  (2004)  ("I[T]here  is
no  reason  to  think  that the  relation  between  the  risk of death  and the  perceived  cost of the  risk
is  linear.").

VALUING  LIFE

different  amounts  to  incur  a  risk,  then  use  of  a  uniform  VSL  will  not
track  actual  behavior,  which  is  what  it is  supposed  to  do.80  If wealthy
people  show  a  higher  WTP  than  poor  people,  then  a  uniform  WTP
based  on a  population-wide  median  will ensure  insufficient  protection
of  wealthy  people  and  excessive  protection  of  poor  people  in  a  way
that might well  prove  harmful to  both groups."  And  if the use  of WTP
then  a  more
is  justified  on  grounds  of  welfare  and  autonomy, 
individuated  approach  is justified  on those same  grounds.

This  Part begins  by  considering  differences  among  risks and  then
explores  differences  among  persons.  It  explains  and  endorses  the
claim  that  in  theory,  full  individuation,  giving  all  people  the  risk
reduction  for  which  they  are  willing  to  pay,  is  required  by  the
prevailing  theory. From this  point, it emphasizes  the problem  with full
individuation,  which  is  that  it  is  not  feasible.  But  an  intermediate
approach, moving  in that direction,  would make a  great  deal of  sense.
The  Part  concludes  with  a  discussion  of  the  implications  for
administrative  law.

A.  Risks

I  have  emphasized  that  the  data  that  underlie  the  $6.1  million
VSL  used  by  the  EPA  come  from  risks  of  accidents  in 
the
workplace-and  that  even  if  these  data  could  be  generalized,  they
would  not justify  a  probability-independent  VSL. But there  is  a  point
of  greater  practical  importance.  A  1/100,000  risk  of  dying  in  a
workplace  accident  might  well  produce  a  different  WTP  from  a
1/100,000  risk  of  dying  of  cancer  from  air  pollution,  which  might  in
turn  be  different  from  a  1/100,000  risk  of  dying  in  an  airplane  as  a
result of  a  terrorist  attack  or  a  1/100,000  risk  of dying  as  a  result of  a
the
defective  snowmobile.  The  very 
government's  current  use  of  VSL  justifies  a  simple  conclusion:  VSL
should  be  risk-specific; it should  not be  the  same  across statistically
equivalent risks. The  use  of a single  number almost  certainly  produces
significant  blunders  and  incorrect  decisions  about  the  appropriate
amount of regulatory  protection.

each  of  five  risks  of  1/100,000.  The  simplest  of  these  risks  involved
dying  from  an  automobile  accident  as  a  result  of  a  defective  brake.
The  four  other  risks  might  be  expected  to  occasion  greater  concern;
they  involved  deaths  from  lung  cancer,  AIDS,  Alzheimer's  disease,
and  airplane  crashes  resulting  from  terrorist  attacks.  The  1/100,000

individuals.  For  each  of  the  questions,  about  ten  respondents  were
willing  to  pay  nothing  to  eliminate  the  1/100,000  risk,  producing  a
VSL  of  zero.  At  the  opposite  end  of  the  spectrum,  about  fifteen
people  were  willing  to  pay  at  least  $500  to  eliminate  each  of  the
1/100,000  risks,  producing  a  VSL of  $50  million. This  informal  study
suggests  that  even  within  a  relatively  homogenous  group 
(law
students),  people  do  not  treat  statistically  identical  risks  in  the  same
way, and indeed  there  are  differences  across  persons  as well  as  across
risks.

With  respect  to  the data  on which  agencies  generally  rely, notice
initially that  the very  category  of  "workplace  risks"  conceals  relevant
differences.  The  American  economy  contains  a  wide  range  of
occupations  and  industries,  and  a  uniform  VSL  should  not  be
expected  to  emerge  from  each  of  them.  Indeed,  a  recent  study  finds
significant  differences  across  both  occupations  and  industries,"  with
blue-collar  workers  showing  a  higher  VSL  than  others. 3  It  is
inevitable  that  a  wide  range  of  values  would  emerge  from  studies
looking  separately  at machine  operators,  executives,  sales  associates,
dental 
security  guards,  and
secretaries'-and  diverse  values  undoubtedly  could  be  found  within
each  category.

technicians,  equipment  cleaners, 

In  addition,  many  risks  controlled  by  the  EPA  are  qualitatively
different  from  the workplace  risks  that the EPA  has  used  to generate
its  VSL.  Two  differences  are  particularly  important.  First,  the
workplace  studies  do  not  involve  cancer,  and  cancer  risks  are  often
involved  in  environmental  decisions.  There  is  considerable  evidence

that  the  risks  associated  with  cancer  produce  a  higher  WTP  than
other  kinds  of risk.s5  For example,  Professors  Hammitt  and  Liu  find
that  in  Taiwan,  WTP  to  eliminate  a  cancer  risk  is  about  one-third
higher  than  WTP  to  avoid  a  risk  of  a  similar,  chronic  degenerative
disease.86  Some  contingent  valuation  studies  suggest  that  people  are
willing  to  pay  twice  as  much  to  prevent  a  cancer  death  as  an
instantaneous  death.'  People  seem  to  have  a  special  fear  of  cancer,
and  they  seem  to  be  willing  to  pay  more  to  prevent  a  cancer  death
than  a  sudden,  unanticipated  death,  or  a  death  from  heart  disease.8
The  "cancer  premium"  might  be  produced  by  the  "dread"  nature  of
cancer;  it  seems  well  established  that  dreaded  risks  produce  special
social concern, holding  the statistical risk constant s9

that  study  assumes 

To  be sure,  existing  evidence  on  this  count  is  not  unambiguous.
One  study  of  occupational  exposures  does  not  find  a  significantly
that
higher  VSL  for  cancer  risks.'  But 
occupational  cancers  account  for  10  to  20  percent  of  all  cancer
deaths-an  amount  that  is  almost  certainly  too  high.  If  occupational
exposures  account  for  5 percent  of  all  cancers-a  far  more  realistic
number-then  the VSL for  cancer risks may be  as high as  $12  million,
about  double  the  amount  that  the  EPA  now  uses.  The  current
findings  conflict;9"  but  in  principle,  the  VSL  figures  should  be  risk-
specific,  and existing  evidence  generally  supports the  view that  cancer
risks produce  an unusually high VSL.

risks  are  not  assumed  voluntarily 

The second  difference  between  workplace  risks  and the  risks that
concern  the  EPA  is  that  the  latter  risks  seem  peculiarly  involuntary
and  uncontrollable. 92  Unlike 
the  risks  of  'workplace  accidents,

compensation.  A  great  deal  of  literature  suggests  that  involuntary,
dread,  uncontrollable,  and  potentially  catastrophic  risks  produce
unusually  high  levels  of  public  concern." 
If  so,  the  numbers  that
derive  from  workplace  accidents  will  substantially  understate  WTP
for  regulatory  benefits  provided  by  the  EPA  and  many  other
agencies.95
The 

implications  of  risk-specific  VSL  go  well  beyond  the
distinction between  workplace  accidents  and  environmental  risks. For
example,  people  appear  to  be  willing  to  pay  far  more  to  produce
safety in  the  air than  on the  highways; 
it follows  that VSL  should be
higher  for  the  FAA  than  for  the  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety
Administration.  Oddly,  the  former  agency  has  an  unusually  low
rather  than  an  unusually  high  VSL.97 Some  diseases  would  produce  a
higher  VSL  than  others.  A  1/100,000  risk  of death  from  Alzheimer's
disease,  for  example,  would  almost  certainly  produce  a  higher  VSL

92.  See,  e.g.,  ACKERMAN  &  HEINZERLING,  supra  note  9,  at  147  (arguing 

that
environmental  risks  are  involuntary  because  they  are  "not  allocated,  even  in  theory,  according
to  market  transactions");  Sunstein,  supra note  54,  at 2285  ("The  risk  of cancer  from  drinking
water  is  qualitatively  different  from  the  workplace  risks  that the  EPA used  to generate  its VSL.
The  risks  from drinking  water  seem  peculiarly  involuntary  and  uncontrollable,  and a great  deal
of literature  suggests that  involuntary and  uncontrollable  risks produce  individual concern.").

93.  Of  course  it  is  possible  to  question  the  idea  that  workplace  risks  are  assumed
voluntarily  and  in  return  for  compensation.  For example,  many  workers probably  do  not know
the risks  that they face.  The  distinction that  I am drawing here  is one  of kind rather  than degree.

than  a  1/100,000 risk of death  from a  heart attack; a  1/50,000  risk of an
AIDS  death  would  not  produce  the  same  VSL  as  a  1/50,000  risk  of
death  from  a  defective  brake  system  on  an  automobile;  most  people
would  pay  more  to  reduce  a  risk  of  dying  from  slow-acting  strokes
than  from  strokes  that  kill  outright.  There  should  be  a  distinctive,
population-wide  median VSL for mortality risks  of airplane  accidents,
of  cancer  from  air  pollution,  of  motor  vehicle  accidents,  of defective
toys,  of cancer  from water pollution.

In  fact  studies  that  have  been  done  for  seatbelt  use,  automobile
safety,  home  fire  detectors,  and  more  find a  wide variety  of numbers,
producing  a  VSL  ranging  from  $770,000  (smoke  detectors,  based  on
data  from  the  1970s)  to  $9.9  million  (fatality  risks  associated  with
safety  belts  and  motorcycle  helmets).9"  And  within  each  of  these
categories  of risk, further distinctions  would undoubtedly emerge.  All
cancer  fatalities  are  not  the  same;  informed  people  would  surely
make  distinctions  between those  that involve long periods  of suffering
and those  that  do  not. If  agencies  are  really interested  in  basing  VSL
on  WTP,  then  a  uniform  number,  treating  all  statistically  identical
mortality  risks as  the same,  is fatally obtuse.

2.  Practice. The  claim  that  VSL  should  vary  by  the  type  of  risk
is  not  entirely  foreign  to  current  regulatory  policy.  In  the  context  of
arsenic  regulation,  for  example,  the  EPA  was  alert  to  some  such
variations."  Hence  its  own  sensitivity  analysis  for  arsenic  suggested
the  need  for  an  upward  revision  of  7  percent  because  of  the
involuntariness  and  uncontrollability  of  the risk. 1°°  With  this  revision,
along  with the  revision  for income  growth,  VSL  would rise  from  $6.1
million  to  $7.2 million.101  In  fact  there  are  reasons  to  suggest  that  this
amount might be  far too low. Dean  Revesz suggests  that "the  value of
avoiding  a  death  from  an  involuntary,  carcinogenic  risk  should  be

times  as 

large  as  the  value  of  avoiding  an
estimated  as  four 
instantaneous  workplace  fatality."' °2  Under  this approach,  the VSL, in
the  context  of arsenic, jumps  from  $6.1  million  to $24.3  million.  I  am
not  arguing  that  $24.3  million  is the  correct  number;  I  am  suggesting
only that VSL, based on WTP, is almost certainly  risk-specific.

3.  Qualifications. Three  qualifications  are  important.  First,
psychological  studies  showing  heightened  public  concern 3  about
particular  risks  may  not translate  into  higher  WTP.  Social  scientists
might  be  able  to  show  that  certain  qualitative  factors  make  people
especially  concerned  about  certain  risks,  but  it  is  an  independent
question  whether  and  how  much  their  WTP  increases  as  a  result.
Fortunately,  a  number  of studies  of WTP  at  least  suggest  answers  to
that  VSL  should  vary  significantly
that  question,  demonstrating 
across  risk types."°4

Second,  there  is  no  simple  or  rigid  distinction  between  the
involuntary/uncontrollable  and  the  voluntary/controllable. 5  It  is  a
mistake  to  believe  that  risks  can  be  neatly  separated  into  the  two
in  Los  Angeles
categories.  Are  the  risks  from  air  pollution 
involuntarily  incurred?  The  answer might  seem  to be  affirmative,  but
people  can  choose  whether  to  live  in  Los  Angeles.  Are  the  risks  of
travel  uncontrollable?  Many  people  think  so,  but  the
airplane 
decision  to  fly  is itself  under  human  control.  Death from  an  asteroid
seems  to be  a  model case  of involuntariness,  at an  opposite  pole  from
hang  gliding.  But  why?  In  deciding  whether  a  risk 
is  faced
involuntarily  or  whether  it  is  within  personal  control,  the  underlying
issues  seem  to  be  whether  those  exposed  to  the  risk  are  exposed
knowingly  and  whether it is  costly or  otherwise  difficult  for people to
avoid the  risk.'O  When risks  are  approached  in  these  terms,  it is  clear
that some  risks  are worse  than others,  even  if the probability  of harm

degree,  associated  with  information  cost,  risk-reduction  cost,  and  the  existence  or  not  of
accompanying  benefits.").

VALUING  LIFE

is  identical.  This  point  is  enough  to  suggest  that  VSL  cannot  be
uniform  across risks.

Third, it is  possible  that extreme  aversion  to certain  risks  reflects
a  form  of  bounded  rationality 1 -and 
it  is  doubtful  whether  that
extreme  aversion  should  be  allowed  to  play  a  role  in  regulatory
policy.  Suppose,  for  example,  that  people  really  are  willing  to  pay
to  avoid  a  cancer  risk  as  to  avoid  a  sudden,
twice  as  much 
unanticipated  death.  Must  these  numbers  be decisive  for purposes  of
policy, assuming  that  the  contingent  valuation  study  is  reliable?  They
might not be  if there is  reason to believe that  the WTP figures  are not
accurately  measuring  welfare.  And  is  it  even  plausible  to  think  that
the  "cancer  premium"  is  so  high  that  it  actually  doubles  the  cost  of
death?  Is  it  reasonable  to  think  that  a  death  from  cancer  is  actually
twice as bad  as  a  death  that is  sudden  and  unanticipated?  To be sure,
a  degree  of pain and  suffering  typically  accompanies  cancer,  and that
fact  illustrates  the  obtuseness  of  using  the  same  number  for  cancer
risks  as for  risks of sudden, unanticipated  deaths.  But it  is not  easy to
defend  the  set  of  (exotic)  values  that  would  lead  to  the  conclusion
that  the  relevant  pain  and suffering  is  as  bad  as  death  itself. If  WTP
does  not  accurately  measure  welfare  in  the  case  of  cancer,  and  if the
inflated  numbers  for cancer deaths  are  a product of an intuitive recoil
or  terror  at  the  idea  of  cancer,  then  regulators  should  not  use  the
unrealistically  high monetary values.

For those  who emphasize  autonomy  rather  than welfare, perhaps
this  point does  not amount  to an  objection  to  the  use  of WTP.  If the
goal  is to  respect people's  autonomy,  regulators  should  defer  to their
judgments  even if  those  judgments  are mistaken.  But  if  people  show
an  especially  high  WTP  because  of a  visceral  reaction  to  cancer,  or
because  of insufficiently  thoughtful  assessments  of  the  stakes,  then  it
is not clear  that autonomy  calls  for following WTP. Government  does
not  respect  people's autonomy  if  it follows  their uninformed  choices;
this  proposition  raises  doubts  about government's  use  of uninformed
WTP.  To  be  least  controversial,  WTP  numbers  would  reflect
informed  rather  than  reflexive  judgments  about  the  nature  of  the
harms  involved.

107.  See  Sunstein,  supra  note  8,  at  248  ("WTP  will  be  a  poor  proxy for  welfare  in cases  in
which  we  have  good  reason  to  suppose  that  underestimation  or  overestimation  is  likely.  Of
course  government officials  should  be  reluctant  to  second-guess  citizens,  but  in some  cases,  the
second-guessing  is well justified.").

B.  Persons

Even  when  risks  are  identical,  people  are  heterogeneous  in  their
values  and  their  preferences.  The  $6.1  million  itself  is  the  median
figure-it  is the  median  of a  set of means.  But  everyone  agrees that in
workplaces  and  elsewhere,  individual  WTP  is  highly  variable.  Some
of  the variability  stems from  different  degrees of  aversion to different
risks.  Some  people  are  especially  concerned  to  avoid  the  dangers
associated  with  pesticides,  whereas  others  focus  on  the  risks  of  air
travel.  Some  of  these  differences  are  a  product  of  beliefs  about
existing risk  levels  and others  of tastes  and values.  So too, people  with
high levels of background  risk  should be expected to be willing  to pay
less to  avoid an  additional  risk of  1/100,000  than those with  low levels
of background  risk.  If, for example,  a relevant  population faces  thirty
annual  mortality  risks  of 1/10,000  or  higher, it  should  be  expected  to
show  a  lower  VSL  with  respect  to  a  new  risk  of  1/100,000  than  a
population  whose  background  risks  are  less  serious."°  The  difference
between  the  VSL of  people  in  wealthy  nations  and  that  of people  in
poor  nations, taken  up  in Part IV, is  partly  a  product  of  the  fact that
the latter group generally  faces far higher background  risks.

It  is  likely  that  WTP  varies  with  respect  to  age  as  well.  It  is
reasonable  to  predict  that  other  things being  equal,  older  people will
show  a  lower WTP and hence  a  lower VSL,  simply because  they have
fewer  years  left.  One  study,  for  example,  finds  that  the  VSL  of  a
forty-eight-year-old  is  10 percent  lower  than  that of  a  thirty-six-year-
old;  another  finds  that  people  under  forty-five  have  a  VSL  twenty
times  higher  than  people  over  sixty-five.' 9 The  most  careful  analysis
suggests  that VSL  peaks  around  age  thirty,  stays constant  for  about  a
decade,  but  declines  from  that  point,  so  much  so  that  the  VSL  for  a
sixty-year-old  is  approximately  half of that of  a person  between  thirty
and  forty."1  These  findings raise  particular  conundrums  in the  case  of
people  under  eighteen;  how  should  government  proceed  if  the  VSL

because  they  have  little  or  no  money?  It  is  implausible  to  use  a  tiny

Along  the  same  lines,  many  analysts  suggest  that  regulatory
policy  should  focus  not  on  the  value  of  statistical  lives  but  on  the
value  of statistical  life-years  (VSLY)."4  Suppose  that they are  right. If
so,  then  the  statistical  lives  of  young  people  are  likely  to  be  worth
more  than  the  statistical  lives  of  older  people.  The  government's
interest  in  focusing  on  VSLY  led  to  widespread  public  objections  to
what,  under  one  proposal,  would  seem  to  be  a  "senior  death
discount."  That discount  would have  valued  someone  over  seventy  as
"worth"  $.62  on  the  dollar."'  But  assuming  that people  over  seventy

to special efforts to ensure  that everyone  enjoys that right.

Even  more  fundamentally,  those  with  little  to  spare  will  show  a
far lower  VSL than  those  who  have  plenty.  WTP  depends  on  ability
to  pay,  and  when  ability  to  pay  is  low,  WTP  will  be  low  as  well,
holding preferences  constant. For this  reason the  VSL of people  with
an annual income  of $50,000  will  be lower  than that  of people with  an
annual  income  of  $150,000.  People  in  the  former  category  might  be
willing  to pay  no more  than  $25  to reduce  a risk of 1/100,000,  whereas
people in the  latter  group  might  be  willing  to pay  as much  as $100.  If
so,  government  should  not require  everyone  to pay  $100;  its  decision
to do so would harm those  unwilling  to pay that  amount.' 7  A uniform

As  a  simple  matter  of  fact,  it  would  be  expected  that  unionized

What  accounts  for  these  differences?  It  should  be  expected  that
whites as  a  class  will show a  higher WTP  and hence  VSL  than  African
Americans  as a  class.  Simply  because whites  are wealthier,  their  WTP
will be  higher  too. Might the same  be  expected  within job categories?
Perhaps  the  answer  is  yes,  if  past  or  present  discrimination,  or
different  starting  points,  produce  racial  disparities  in  compensation
for  risk  within  similar  jobs.  The  precise  causes  and  levels  of  the
disparities  are unclear,  and  the  differences  between  Professors  Leeth
and  Ruser on  the one  hand  and Professor Viscusi  on the  other remain
a  puzzle.  There  is  no  a priori reason  to  think  that  men  or  women
would  show  a  higher  VSL.  If  the  relevant  group  of  women  is
wealthier,  then  its WTP should be  higher too. And  if women  are more
averse  to  mortality  risks than  men,  they  will show a  higher  WTP, just
because  they  will  demand  a  higher  premium.  For  my  purposes,  the
central  point  is  that  demographic  differences  in  VSL  are  entirely  to
be  expected,  and  they  are found  in both studies.

C.  Theory and Practice

If the  foregoing  points  are  put together,  it is  apparent  that there
is  not  one  VSL,  but  an  exceptionally  large  number  of  VSLs.  In  fact
each  of  us  has  not one  VSL  but  a  number  of  them,  targeted  to each
risk that  each of  us faces.  A policy  that  truly  tracked  WTP,  and based
VSL  on  WTP,  would  seek  to  provide  all  people  with  the  level  of
protection  for  which  they  are  willing  to  pay  to  reduce  each  risk.

Tracking  WTP  is  the  goal  that  underlies  current  practice;  and  apart
from  questions  of  administrability,  it  calls  for  a  maximum  level  of
individuation.

1.  A  Thought Experiment.  As  a  thought  experiment,  suppose
that  an  all-knowing  regulator  could  costlessly  determine  each
person's  WTP  for  each  statistical  risk  that  he  faces-and  perfectly
match  the  level  of  regulatory  protection  to  that  WTP.  In  these
circumstances,  the  regulator  should  give  all  people  no  more  and  no
less  than  their  WTP  for  each  risk  that  they  face.  (In  cases  in  which
people's  WTP  was  low because  of poverty,  they  might  be  subsidized;
but  they  would  not  be  forced  to  purchase  goods  for  an  amount  in
excess  of their  WTP.  I will  return to  this  point,13°  but subsidies  are  not
my  topic  here.)  Under  this  approach,  regulatory  benefits  would  be
treated  the  same  as  every other  commodity  that is  traded  on  markets,
including  safety  itself.  Of  course  most  people  face  extremely  serious
problems  in  dealing  with  risk,  stemming  both  from  an  absence  of
rationality.13  The  all-knowing
information  and 
regulator  would  overcome  these  problems  and  provide  people  with
what they would want  if they did not suffer from them.

from  bounded 

If  agencies  could  do  this,  then  the  current  theory  would  be
perfectly  implemented.  It  would  follow  that  with  full  individuation,
overall  WTP would be  lower for poor  people than  for wealthy  people,
for  African  Americans  than  for  whites,  and  (possibly)  for  men  than
for  women.  But,  under  this  thought  experiment,  government  would
not  discriminate  against  groups;  for example,  it  would  neither  decide
on  high  VSLs  for  programs  predominantly  benefiting  whites  nor
decide  on  low  VSLs  for  programs  predominantly  benefiting  African
Americans.  The  difference  would  be a  product of aggregation  of fully
individual  VSLs-aggregation  of  the  kind  that  most  conventional
markets,  including  those  for  automobiles  and  consumer  goods,  now
provide.  Recall  that  the  use  of  WTP  is  justified  because  of  its
connection  with  welfare  and  individual  autonomy.  If  so,  then  fully
individual  VSLs are justified on  those same grounds.

[Vol.  54:385

Of  course  there  are 

two  practical  problems  with  taking  the
thought  experiment  seriously.  The  first is  that  agencies  do  not  know
the  WTP  of  every  individual,  and  as  a  practical  matter,  it  is  not
possible  to  find  out.  The  second  problem  is  that  regulatory  benefits
are  often  collective  goods-goods  that  cannot feasibly  be provided  to
one  without  also  being  provided  to  many.  In  the  context  of  air
pollution,  for  example,  it  is  not  possible  to  provide  cleaner  air  for
some  without  providing  cleaner  air  for  many  or  all.  In  regulating  air
pollution  and water pollution,  individuation is simply not  an option.

These  problems  are  fatal  objections  to  full  individuation.  But
they  are  not  fatal  objections  to  more individuation.  At  a  minimum,
agencies  should be  encouraged  to  take  account  of existing  research  in
in
their  sensitivity  analyses,  which  would  result  (for  example) 
increased  "upper  bound"  estimates  for  cancer  risks.'32  In  addition,
disparities  in  VSL  findings  might  be  mapped  onto  different  agency
estimates,  producing  reasonable  rather  than  arbitrary  differences  in
VSL  across  agencies.  If,  for  example,  the  risks  of  death  from
workplace  accidents  produce  a  lower  number  than  the  risks  of  death
from  consumer  products,  then  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health
Administration  should  use a  lower  VSL  than the  Consumer Products
Safety  Commission.  It is  easy to imagine  a research  program  in which
the  Office  of  Information  and  Regulatory  Affairs  would  attempt  to
information  on  VSL  across  different  risks.  A
elicit  far  more 
movement  in this direction  need not raise  troubling  ethical  questions.
It  would  be  far  more  controversial  to  suggest  that  agencies
should  adopt  different  VSLs  depending  on  whether  the  affected
population  is  especially  wealthy  or  especially  poor.  But  at  the  very
least,  agencies  should  adjust VSL  to  changes  in  national  wealth  over
time,  producing  a  higher  amount  than  would  result  from  inflation
adjustments  alone.133  Or  suppose,  for  example,  that  a  regulation  is
designed  to  protect  migrant  farmworkers,  expected  to  show  a  low
VSL.  Current  studies  in  fact  estimate  the  relationship  between
income  and  WTP,' 3'  allowing  agencies  to  make  suitable  adjustments
to  their  VSLs.  And  when  the  population  is  relatively  wealthy,  the
agency  might  adopt  a  higher  VSL.  For  present  purposes,  I  am

suggesting  only  that  an  approach  of  this  kind  is  indicated  by  the
theory  that  government  now  uses.  I  turn  in  Part  III  to  the  larger
questions that such  an approach  would  make  it necessary  to answer.

to  law  reviews-a

2.  Optimal  Individuation:  An  Intermediate  Approach.  The
larger  question  is  simple:  What  is  the  optimal  level  of  individuation
with respect to  the value  of life?  The  answer  depends  in part  on how
much  is  known.  Even in markets, individuals  are  not usually asked,  or
charged,  their  particular  WTP.  In  real  estate  markets,  negotiation
between  individuals  is  the  usual  practice.  But for  ordinary  consumer
goods--cereal,  soap,  casebooks,  subscriptions 
standard  price  emerges  from  the  forces  of  supply  and  demand.  It
seems  clear  that  a  uniform  VSL,  cutting  across  domains  in  which
those  forces  almost  certainly  establish  disparate  amounts,  fits  poorly
with  the theory  that currently underlies  government  practice.  It is  also
clear  that full  individuation  is  not feasible.  The appropriate  approach
depends  on two  familiar  variables: the  costs  of decisions  and  the  costs
of errors. In the  early years of cost-benefit  analysis, a  uniform number
was  probably  the  best  that  agencies  could  do.  As  better  information
emerges  about  different  VSLs  across  risks  and  persons,  the  use  of a
uniform  number  will  be  increasingly  difficult  to  support.  If  those
differences  are  substantial,  the  argument  for  further  differentiation
will  be  strengthened.  A uniform  number  might  be  seen  as  a  plausible
"first-generation"  response  to  the  problems  posed  by  cost-benefit
analysis.  The  second  generation  is  now  well  underway,  and  hence
finer distinctions  will be increasingly  hard to resist.

3.  Administrative  Law.  How  would 

the  use  of  more
individuated  VSLs bear  on  the legality  of agency  action?  Courts have
started  to  develop  principles  by  which  to  review  agency  decisions
about  how  to  assess  the  costs  and  benefits  of  regulation."'  Some
statutes  explicitly  require  agencies  to  balance  costs  against  benefits,
and  under  such  statutes  an  agency's  choices  about valuation might  be

challenged  as  unreasonable  or  arbitrary. 13 6 If an agency  used  a VSL of
$200,000,  it  would  almost  certainly  be  assigning  an  arbitrarily  and
hence  unlawfully  low  monetary  value;  if it  used a  VSL of  $40 million,
its  selection  would  be  arbitrarily  high.137  In  all  cases  agencies  are
required  to  produce  a  reasonable  explanation  for  why  they  have
proceeded one  way rather  than another.

In view of the arguments  made thus far, it is easy  to imagine  legal
challenges  to  agency  decisions.  Suppose  that  the  EPA  continues  to
use  the  $6.1  million  VSL  based  on  workplace  studies.  The  agency's
decision  would  be  vulnerable  on  several  grounds.  First,  it  might  be
too low in light  of the  growth  in national  income. Second, it would fail
to  account  for  evidence  that  pollution  risks,  especially  if  cancer  is
involved,  produce  a  higher VSL than workplace  risks. Third, it would
not,  on  the  facts  stated,  come  to  terms  with  the  possibility  that  the
protected group might be wealthier  or poorer than the group involved
in  the  workplace  studies.  All  of  these  challenges  are  plausible  under
existing  law.  As  new  and  better  data  emerge,  they  become  stronger
still.  It  is  certainly  possible  that  a  decade  from  now,  the  use  of  a
uniform figure will  seem obtuse,  even indefensible.

Is  there anything  that agencies  might  say in  defense  of a  uniform
VSL?  They  might  urge  that  the  existing  evidence  is  too  ambiguous
and  contestable  to justify  a  change  in  current  practice.  Most  studies
based  on  more  recent  data  find  a  VSL in  the  range  of  $6.1  million.139
With  respect  to  cancer,  the  EPA's  Science  Advisory  Board  (SAB)

evidence  directly  supports  the  view  of  the  SAB.'4 '  To  be  sure,  it  is
more  than  plausible  to  think  that  VSL  is  wealth-dependent;  but  the
EPA  might  urge  that  a  uniform  number  is  preferable  on  moral  and
distributive  grounds  and  is  not  greatly  out  of  line  with  existing
evidence.  In  any  case,  a  single  number  might  have  the  advantage  of
easy  administrability-and  produce  results  that  in  general  would  be
the  same  as  those  produced  by  imaginable  variations.  Most  of  the
time,  the  agency's  choice will not be  affected  if it selects  a  VSL of $3.5
million  or  $10  million;  in  such  situations,  a  uniform  number  seems
acceptable.

In  many  cases,  I believe  that these responses  are  unconvincing  as
a matter  of policy.  But in  light of the properly  limited  role of courts in
the  oversight  of  agency  action,  they  are  convincing  as  a  matter  of
law.142  Courts  should  allow  agencies  considerable  room  to  maneuver
here,  at  least  until  the  evidence  against  a  uniform  VSL  becomes
overwhelming.  Permission  to  adopt  such  a  number  has  an  important
corollary:  an  agency  would  be  on  firm legal  ground  if it  attempted  to
make  adjustments  of  the  sort  that  I  have  suggested,  even  if  current
evidence  does not unambiguously  support  those adjustments.

III.  WHY WTP? EASY  CASES, HARD  CASES

Thus  far  I  have  assumed  that  the  theory  behind  current  practice
is  straightforward-that  it  depends  on  an  empirical  elicitation  of
people's  WTP as the foundation  for VSL.  If the assumption  is correct,
then  a  high  degree  of  individuation  is  justified.  But  perhaps  the
assumption  is  false.  Perhaps  the  prevailing  theory  does  rely  on
elicited  WTP  but  also  adopts  a  norm  in  favor  of  the  equality  of
persons  (and  possibly  mortality  risks  as  well).  Might  that  more
complex  theory  be  correct?  In  any  case,  what  is  the  argument  for
embodying  people's  actual  WTP  in  regulatory  policy?  Why  should
anyone  care  about  actual  WTP  at  all?  Why  should  government
conduct  cost-benefit  analysis with close  reference  to VSL?' 4"

effect"  of  cancer  is  supported  by  the  finding  that  contingent  valuation  estimates  of  cancer

in  which 

It is now  time  to attend  to those  issues  in  more detail.  This Part
begins  by  discussing  what  I  call  "easy  cases," 
the
beneficiaries  of regulation must pay for  it. I suggest  that in such cases,
WTP is  the appropriate  foundation  for VSL,  because beneficiaries  are
hardly  helped  by  being  forced  to  pay  for  regulatory  programs  that
they believe  not  to be in  their  interests.  The  major qualification  here
involves  lack  of  information  and  bounded  rationality.  I then  attempt
to  defend  the  claim  that  the  analysis  must  be  different  in  "hard
cases,"  in which  beneficiaries  pay  for little  or none  of the  cost of what
they receive. But even in such  cases,  an optimal income  tax,  providing
the right level  of redistribution, would  go  a long way  toward justifying
a  variable  VSL.  If  a  nation  lacks  an  optimal  income  tax,  and  seeks
greater  redistribution,  the use  of a  VSL  that exceeds  the  WTP  of the
beneficiaries  might produce  desirable  redistribution  or be justified  on
welfare grounds.  I  outline  the circumstances  in which this might be  so.

A.  Easy Cases

For the  sake  of simplicity,  assume  a  society in  which  people  face
multiple  risks  of  1/100,000,  and  in  which  every  person  is  both
adequately  informed  and  willing  to  pay no more  and  no  less than  $60
to  eliminate  each  of  those  risks.  Assume  too  that  the  cost  of
eliminating  these  1/100,000 risks is widely  variable,  ranging from close
to  zero  to  many  billions  of  dollars.  Assume  finally  that  the  cost  of
eliminating  any  risk  is  borne  entirely  by  those  who  benefit  from risk
elimination.  Under 
the
equivalent  of a  user  fee; for  example,  people's  water bills will entirely
reflect  the  costs  of  a  policy  that eliminates  a  1/100,000  risk  of getting
cancer  from  arsenic  in drinking  water.  If the per-person  cost is $100,
each water  bill will be  increased  by exactly that amount.

that  assumption, 

regulation 

imposes 

these  assumptions, 

1.  Welfare  and  Autonomy.  With 

the
argument  for  using  WTP  to  calculate  VSL  is  straightforward.
Regulation  amounts  to  a  forced  exchange;  it  tells  people  that  they
must  purchase  certain  benefits  for  a  certain  amount.  Why  should
government  force  people  to  pay  for  things  that  they  do  not  want?
Begin  with  welfare.  By  hypothesis,  a  forced  exchange  on  terms  that
people  dislike  will  make  them  worse  off.  The  case  for  using  WTP
depends  on  the  simple  idea  that  government  should  make  Pareto
superior moves  (those  making  at  least  one  person  better  off  without
making  anyone  worse  off)  and  that  it  should  avoid  making  Pareto
inferior  moves  (those  making  at  least  one  person  worse  off  without

VALUING  LIFE

making  anyone  better  off).  At  first  glance,  use  of  WTP,  on  the
assumptions  that I am making, seems hard  to contest.14

1

For  purposes  of  evaluating  regulation,  it  does  not  matter  if  the
existing  distribution  of  income  is  unjust  or  if  poor  people  are,  in  an
intelligible  sense,  coerced  to run  certain  risks.  The  remedy  for unjust
distributions, and for that form  of coercion,  is not to  require people  to
buy regulatory benefits on terms that they find unacceptable.  Suppose
that  people  are  willing  to pay  only  $60  to  eliminate  a  1/100,000  risk
because  they  are  not  rich,  and  that  if  they  had  double  their  current
wealth,  they  would  be willing  to  pay  $120.  Government  does  people
no  favors  by forcing  them  to  pay  the  amount  that  they would  pay  if
they had more money.

I  have  suggested 

that  for  those  who  do  not  believe  that
regulatory  decisions  should  be  based  on  welfare,  considerations  of
autonomy  point  in  the  same  direction.' 6 Those  who  refuse  to  pay  a
certain amount  to eliminate  a risk of  1/100,000 might  want to use their
resources  for  other  things-medical  care,  children,  food,  recreation,
entertainment, savings.  If people  are  entitled to  a kind  of sovereignty
over  the conduct  of their  own  lives,  then they should  be  permitted  to
make such allocations  as they choose. It is  most standard  to justify use
of  VTP  on welfare  grounds,  but the same  approach is  at least  equally
defensible  as a means of respecting the autonomy  of persons.'17

Consider  how  this  argument  works  with  respect  to  risks  and
persons.  Suppose  that  people  are  willing  to  pay  no  more than  $50  to
avoid  a 1/100,000  risk of dying in a  car crash,  but that they are  willing
to  pay  up  to  $100  to  avoid  a  1/100,000  risk  of  dying  of  cancer.  If
government  uses  a  WTP  for  both  risks  of  $75,  it will  force  people  to

145. 

I am putting  to  one  side  the  possibility  that  WTP  and hence  VSL  reflect  competition
for  better relative  position;  if so,  the VSL  numbers,  based on market  evidence,  are  too  low.  See
Frank & Sunstein,  supra note  62, at  363  (finding that the  failure  to take  into account  concerns of
relative  position  tends  to  underestimate  risk-reduction  benefits).  A brief example:  Suppose  that
workers  are  willing  to  pay  only  $250  annually  to  eliminate  a  1/10,000  risk;  suppose  too  that
worker well-being  depends, in  large  part, on relative  income,  not absolute  income;  and suppose
finally  that  workers  would  be  willing  to pay  more  than  $250  if all  workers were  simultaneously
making  the same  payment,  because  in  that event,  relative  position would  not be  compromised.
Under these  assumptions,  the WTP  numbers, based  on market  evidence  or contingent  valuation
studies,  underestimate  VSL by  a  significant  amount. See  id. (estimating  that  the  failure  to  take
relative  position  into account  could lead  to undervaluing  VSL by  roughly  75  percent).

pay  more  than  they  want  to  avoid  the  risks  associated  with  car
crashes,  and less  than  they want  to  avoid  risks of  cancer. Why  should
government  do  that?  And  if  the  argument  is  convincing  in  this
example,  it should apply  in  numerous  cases  in  which  WTP  and  hence
VSL vary  across risks.

With  respect  to  persons,  the  argument  is  more  controversial,
above  all because  it treats  poor people  as  less valuable  (literally)  than
rich  people.  But  at  least  at  first  glance,  differences  are  appropriate
here as  well. The reason  is not that poor people  are  less valuable  than
rich  people.  It  is  that  no  one,  rich  or  poor,  should  be  forced  to  pay
more  than  he  is  willing  to  pay  for  the  reduction  of  risks.  This  idea
embodies a  norm of equality. And  if poor people  are unwilling to pay
much  for  the  reduction  of  serious  risks,  the  appropriate  response  is
not  a  compelled  purchase,  but  a  subsidy.  Suppose,  for  example,  that
each  member  of  a  group  of  relatively  poor  people,  earning  less  than
$30,000  annually,  is  willing  to  pay  only  $25  to  eliminate  a  risk  of
1/100,000-about  one-half,  suppose,  of  the  nation's  population-wide
median  of  $50.  Should  regulators  require  every  citizen,  including
those  in  the  relatively  poor  group,  to  pay  $50?  Government  should
not  force  poor  people  to  pay  more  than  their  WTP  to  eliminate
statistical risks;  forced  exchanges  of this kind  do  poor  people  no good
and some  harm.

It  is  tempting  to  justify  a  uniform  VSL,  one  that  does  not
distinguish  between  rich  and  poor,  on  the ground  that  it  embodies  a
form  of  risk  equity,  treating  every  person  as  equal  to  every  other
person 1"  and redistributing  resources  in  the  direction  of poor  people.
But  this  is  an  error. A  uniform  VSL,  taken  from  a  population-wide
median,  does  not  produce  redistribution  toward  the  poor,  any  more
than  any  other  kind  of  forced  exchange.  Government  does  not
require  people  to  buy  Volvos,  even  though  Volvos  would  reduce
statistical  risks.  If  government  required  everyone  to  buy  Volvos,  it
would  not  be  producing  desirable  redistribution. 9  A  uniform  VSL

148.  See ACKERMAN  & HEINZERLING, supra note  9,  at 72  (arguing  that varying  VSL  based
on  potential  earnings  is  "difficult  to  reconcile  with  ideals  of democracy  and  equal  treatment
under the  law, let alone the  sacredness  of every human  being").

149.  Of  course  it  is  sometimes  desirable  for  government  to  create  "safety  floors,"  for
automobiles  and  other  consumer  goods,  in  part  as  a  response  to  an  absence  of  adequate
information  in  the  market.  But  such  floors  should not  be  seen  as  a  redistributive  tool, because
they  are  not  likely  to  produce  good  redistribution.  Cf  Susan  Rose-Ackerman,  Comment,

has  some  of the  same  characteristics  as  a  policy  that  requires  people
to  buy  Volvos.  In  principle,  the  government  should  force  exchanges
only  on  terms  that  people  find  acceptable,  at  least  if  it  is  genuinely
concerned with their  welfare.

Note,  once  again,  that  the  argument  for  using  WTP  does  not
imply  satisfaction  with  the  existing  distribution  of  wealth.  The
is  that  they  do  nothing  to  alter

low  WTP  for  environmental  goods,  including  health  improvements,
simply  because  they  have  adjusted  to  environmental  bads,  including
health  risks.  Perhaps  people's  WTP  reflects  an  effort  to  reduce
cognitive  dissonance  through the  conclusion  that  risks  are  lower than
they  actually  are.5  To  generalize,  perhaps  people  suffer  from  a
problem  of  "miswanting";...  they want things  that  do  not  promote
their  welfare,  and  they  do not  want  things  that would  promote  their
welfare.  If  this  is  so,  then  WTP  loses  much  of  its  underlying
justification;  people's  decisions  do  not  actually  promote

government  can  be  confident  that  people  are  not  willing  to  pay  for
goods  from  which  they  would  greatly  benefit,  perhaps  government

In  some  contexts,  this  objection  raises  serious  problems  for
neoclassical  economics  and  for  unambivalent  enthusiasm for freedom
of  choice.'57  Autonomy  is  implicated  in  addition  to  welfare.  Suppose
that people do  not want risk  reduction  because they believe  risk  to be
inevitable,  or  because  their  preferences  have  adapted  to  dangerous
and  unfair  conditions.  If so,  people's  preferences  do  not  reflect  their
autonomy.  In  other words,  the  idea of autonomy  requires  not merely

respect  for  whatever  preferences  people  happen  to  have,  but  also
social  conditions  that  allow  preferences  to be  developed  in  a way  that
does  not  reflect  coercion  or  injustice.  With  respect  to  some  risks, the
relevant  preferences  are nonautonomous;  consider  the  fact  that many
women face  a  risk of male  violence under circumstances  in which they
believe  that little can  be done  and hence adapt.

In  the  context  of  ordinary  regulatory  policy,  however,  this
objection  has  more 
theoretical  than  practical  interest.  Typically
regulation  involves  the  reduction  of  low-level  mortality  risks  (say,
1/50,000).  Much  of the  time, there  is no  reason  to  believe  that  the use
of  informed  WTP  (say,  $100)  is  a  product  of  adaptive  preferences.
When people's  WTP does  appear  to result from adaptive  preferences,
however,  the judgment  about the easy cases must be  revised.

b.  Inadequate Information and Bounded Rationality. A  closely
related  objection  would  point  to  an  absence  of  information  and  to
bounded  rationality.  As  I  have  stressed  throughout,  people  have
difficulty  dealing  with  low-probability  events.5 
If  people  are  not
aware  of what  they might  be  gaining  by regulation,  their  WTP can  be
too 
to
low.  Perhaps  the  availability  heuristic  will  lead  people 
underestimate  the  risk.  If  people  cannot  recall  a  case  in  which  some
activity  produced  illness  or  death,  they may  conclude  that  the  risk  is
trivial  even  if  it is  not. Or perhaps  the same  heuristic,  and probability
neglect,  will  lead  people  to  exaggerate  risks, producing  a  WTP that is
wildly  inflated  in  light  of  reality.  And  if  people  are  unable  to
understand  the  meaning  of ideas  like  "one  in  fifty  thousand,"  or  to
respond  rationally to  such ideas, then  there  are  serious  problems  with
relying  on WTP.

It 

is  also  possible 

that  people's  WTP  reflects  excessive
discounting  of  future  health  benefits.  If  workers  are  ignoring  the
future,  or  applying  an  implausibly  high  discount  rate,  then  there  is  a
good  argument  for  setting  aside  their  WTP. In  the  context  of  global
warming,  for  example,  the  temporally  distant  nature  of  the  harm
might  well  lead  to  insufficient  concern  for  a  potentially  catastrophic
risk.  The same  is  true  for  less dramatic  risks  that people  face  in  their
daily  lives.  Young  smokers,  for  example,  probably  give  too  little
attention to the  health harms caused by  smoking. Those who  choose  a

poor diet  and  little exercise  almost  certainly  fail  to consider  the  long-
term  effects of their  behavior. Self-control  problems  are an  important
part  of  bounded  rationality.  If  a  low  WTP  shows  a  failure  to  give
adequate  attention  to the  future, then there  is reason not to use WTP.
In  many  cases, however, WTP is  a result  of adequate  information

c.  Rights. A  quite  different  objection  would  point  to  people's
rights.  Perhaps  people  have  a  right  not  to  be  subjected  to risks  of  a
certain magnitude,  and the  use of WTP will violate this right. It seems
fully  reasonable  to  say  that  whatever  their  WTP,  human  beings
should  have  a  right not  to  be  subject  to  risks  above  a particular  level.
Imagine,  for  example,  that poor people  live in a place  where  they face
a  1/20  annual risk  of dying from  water pollution;  it makes  sense to say
that the government  should  reduce  that risk  even if people  are willing
to  pay only $1 to  eliminate it and  the per-person  cost is  $100.'59

As  an  abstract  claim  about  people's  rights,  the  objection  is
entirely  correct.  Something  has  gone  badly  wrong  if  people  are
exposed  to serious risks  and  their WTP prevents  them, and  is invoked
to  prevent  their  government,  from  doing  anything  in  response.  It
would  be  foolish  to  suggest  that  WTP  is  determinative  of  the
appropriate  use  of government  subsidies;  a redistributive  policy  does
track  people's  WTP.  (Would  it  make  sense  to  say  that
not 
government  would  give  poor  people  a  check  for  $100  only  if  they
were  willing  to  pay  $100  for  the  check?)  And  in  many  cases  people
are  subject  to  risks  whose  magnitude  is  indeed  a  violation  of  rights.
But  this  point  has  little  force  against  the  particular  argument  that  I
am making.

The  initial  problem  with  this objection  is  that  in  the  cases  under
discussion,  rights  of this  kind  are  usually  not involved;  I  am  speaking
here  of  statistically  small  risks.  Suppose  that  this  initial  response  is
unconvincing  and  that rights  are  indeed  involved.  If so,  there  is  a  still
more  fundamental  response.  When  rights  are  involved,  the  proper
response  is  not  to  force  people  to  buy  protection  that  they  do  not
want, but  to provide  a  subsidy  that will  give  them the  benefit for  free
or  enable  them  to  receive  the  benefit  at  what  is,  for  them,  an

159. 

I bracket  the  possibility  that  rights  are  resource-dependent,  and  I simply  assume  here

that risks above  a  certain level  should  count as  violative of rights.

subjection  to  risks  above  a  certain  level  is a  violation  of rights."' The
question  instead is one  of regulation under the  stated assumptions.  So
long  as  that  is  the  question,  use  of  WTP  does  not  violate  anyone's
rights.

the  particular  context  of  environmental  protection,  solutions  require
regulators  "to  go  beyond  looking only  for  the best  reflection  of  given
individual  preferences,  or  the most  acceptable  procedures  for choices
based  on  those preferences. ' '6

Professor  Sen's  claims  are  both  fundamental  and  correct.  They
point  to  some  serious  limitations  on  the  use  of  WTP.  But  it  is
important  not  to read  such  objections  for  more  than  they  are  worth.
In  trading  off  safety  and  health  in  their  private  lives,  people  do  not
have  static  values  and  preferences.  Much  of the  time,  human  choices
are  a  product  of  reflection,  even  if  choosers  are  simply  acting  as
including  reflection  and
consumers.  Reflection  and  deliberation, 
deliberation  with  other  people,  are  hardly  absent  from  the  market
domain.  To  be  sure,  moral  questions  should  not  be  resolved  by
aggregating  private  WTP.  Sometimes  people's  preferences,  even
though backed  by  WTP,  are  morally  off-limits,  and  policy  should  not
take  account  of them.  In  addition,  people  are  sometimes  unwilling  to
pay  a  great  deal  for  goods  that  have  strong  moral  justifications;
animal  welfare  is  an  example.  In  these  circumstances,  the  market
model  is inapplicable  and  WTP reveals  very  little.

But what  about the  easy  case?  Do  these  arguments  suggest  that
government  should  override  individual  choices  about  how  much  to
spend  to  eliminate  low-level  risks,  even  when  those  choices  are
adequately  informed?  For  environmental  protection  generally,  it  is
indeed  important  to go  beyond  "the  best reflection  of given individual
preferences.' ' 169 But  this  point  does  not  mean  that  people  should  be
required  to  pay  $100  to  eliminate  mortality  risks  of  1/100,000  when
they are  willing  to  pay  only  $75.  If  people's  WTP reflects  an  absence
of  information  or  insufficient  deliberation,  then  it  is  important  for
other  people, in  government  and  elsewhere,  to  draw  attention  to  that
fact.  And  in  some  cases,  a  low  WTP  might  be  overridden  on  the
ground  that  it  is  rooted  in  errors,  factual  or  otherwise.  But  these
points  should  not  be  taken  as  a  general  objection  to  my  conclusion
about  the  easy  case,  or  to  suggest  that  government  should  force
people  to  reduce  statistical  risks  at  an  expense  that  they  deem
excessive.

Here  is  one  way  to  understand  the  argument  that  I  am  making:

this  democracy,  it  is  valuable  for  regulators  to  consider  more  fully
individuated  VSLs  in  deciding  how  to  proceed,  at  least  under  the
stated  assumptions.

e.  Very  Low  Probabilities and Catastrophic Risks.  Suppose  that
in  the  United  States  faces  an  annual  death  risk  of
everyone 
1/10,000,000-and that  this  risk, if it  comes  to  fruition,  will  kill  every
person  in  the  country.  The  expected  number  of  annual  deaths  is
twenty-six, '  which would  produce  expected  annual  costs  in excess  of
$158  million, assuming  a  VSL  of  $6.1  million.  But  if  the  government
attempted  to  elicit  each  individual's  WTP  to  avoid  a  risk  of
1/10,000,000,  it might  well  produce  a  number very close  to  zero.  How
much would  you  be willing  to spend to  avoid  a  risk  of 1/10,000,000?  If
you  say  "nothing,"  you  might  well  be  like  most people.  And  if most
people  really  are  like  that,  the  supposed  risk  of  1/10,000,000,
applicable  to  everyone  in  the  United  States,  yields  both  twenty-six
expected  annual  fatalities  and  expected  annual  costs  very  close  to
zero-an  especially  odd  result  in  light  of  the  fact  that  there  is  a
1/10,000,000  risk  not  simply  that  each  American  will  die,  but  that
every American  will die.'71

This  result  does  seem  anomalous.  For  one  thing,  is  it  really
sensible to conclude  that the  prevention  of twenty-six  deaths  is worth
nothing,  or  close  to  it?  An  affirmative  answer  is  suggested  by  a
perspective  that  is  fully  based  on  people's  WTP  to  avoid  very  low
probability  risks.  But  assigning  a  value  near  zero,  for  the  prevention
of  dozens  of  deaths,  seems  quite  implausible.  In  cases  of  this  kind,
there  is  a serious  problem  with using  WTP  to  calculate  the benefit  of
avoiding that risk.

This  conclusion  actually  understates  the  problem.  In  the  case  at
hand,  the  risk  is  potentially  catastrophic.  As  I  have  said,  if  the
1/10,000,000  chance  is  realized,  every  American  will  be  dead. Even  if
people  show  a WTP  near  zero  to  avoid  a  risk  of  that size,  it does  not
seem  right  to  think  that  the  nation  should  spend  almost  nothing  to
prevent  it." 2  The  point  has  a  general  bearing  on  precautions  against
low  probability  risks  of  catastrophe:  some  degree  of  prevention

should  be undertaken  even  if WTP  numbers  do  not justify  it.  Part  of
the  problem  with  those  numbers  is  that  individual  behavior  will  not
reflect  the  "catastrophe  premium"  or  "extermination  premium"  that
would almost certainly  emerge if it  were possible  to  test for it. People
may  be  unwilling  to pay  anything  to avoid  a risk  of  1/100,000,000  that
they  themselves  face;  but  if  they  were  told  that  every  person  in  the
nation  faced  this  risk, they  might  come  up  with  a significantly  higher
figure.  It  would  take  the  right  question  to  produce  the  higher
numbers.  Another  the  problem  is  that  WTP  is  not  an  adequate
measure  of  social  responses  to  catastrophes-in  part because  people
are  not familiar  with making choices  about risks of that  sort.

In my  view,  this  is  a sound  objection  to the  use of  a low  or  near-
zero  VSL  in  the  context  of  catastrophic  risks,  even  if  the  WTP
calculation  would  produce  that  VSL.  As  Judge  Richard  Posner
shows,173  this  is  an  important  point  when  government  is  considering
how  to  respond  to  small  risks  of  catastrophic  harm.  But  notice  that
the  objection  has  built-in  limitations.  It  does  not  apply  to  the
overwhelming  number  of cases  in  which  VSL  is  used.  In  those  cases,
the  risks  in  question  are  1/10,000  to  1/100,000,  and  no  large-scale
catastrophe  is  at  issue. Here,  then,  is  a limitation  on  the  use  of WTP,
but the domain  of the objection  is restricted.

f  Third-Party Effects.  A  final  objection  would  point  to  effects
on  third  parties.  If  outsiders  would  be  adversely  affected  by  the
undervaluing  of  a  particular  risk,  and  if  their  welfare  is  not  being
considered,  then  the  WTP calculus  is seriously  incomplete.  This point
demonstrates  a  general  and badly neglected  problem  for WTP  as  it is
currently  used:  agencies  consider  people's  WTP 
to  eliminate
statistical  risks,  without  taking  account  of  the  fact  that  others-
especially  family  members and close  friends-would  also be  willing to
pay  something  to eliminate  those  risks.  John  might  be  willing  to pay
$25  to eliminate his own risk  of 1/100,000, but his  wife, Jane, might  be
willing  to pay  $25  to  eliminate  John's  risk  also.  If regulators  add  the
WTP, on  John's behalf, of John's friends  and  relatives,  the total WTP
might  soon  exceed  $100.  This  is  a  real  problem  for  existing  uses  of
WTP.

But  thus  far  the  discussion  has  been  assuming  that there  are  no
third-party  effects.  The  argument  for  using  WTP,  on  the  stated
assumptions, is  that government should not force people  to buy goods

that  are  not  worthwhile  for  them.  At  least  at  first  glance,  this
argument  seems  sound  with respect  to  statistical  risks  of  the  kind  on
which  I am focusing.

regulation,  for  example, 

There  is  an  obvious  artificiality  in  the assumptions  thus  far. Most
important,  people  do  not  always  bear  the  full  social  costs  of  the
regulatory  benefits  that  they  receive.  Sometimes  they  pay  only  a
fraction  of those  costs-or possibly nothing at  all. When  this is so, the
normative  analysis  is  much  more  complicated.  In  the  context  of  air

pollution 
distributional  effects,  and  on  balance,  poor  people,  and  members  of
minority  communities,  appear  to  be  net  gainers.'75  An  efficiency
analysis,  based  on  WTP,  might  not produce  an  adequate  account  of
the  welfare  effects  of  air  pollution  regulation.  And  even  if it  did,  an
account  of welfare  effects  might  not  resolve  the normative  question,
because  the  distributional  gains  are  important  to  consider.'  The
difficulty  is that  a high VSL,  one  that  exceeds what WTP studies  show
for  poor  people,  may  produce  outcomes  that  are  in  the best  interest
of  poor  people, in  the  sense  that  the result  is a  welfare  improvement
for  them.'7"  And  if  poor  people  do  not  bear  all  of  the  costs  of

California  and  finding  that, under  the  Clean  Air Act,  "poorer,  less educated  populations  have

176.  The  Office  of Management  and  Budget  has  expressly  recognized  this  point  in its  most

among  sub-populations  of  particular  concern)  so  that  decisionmakers  can  properly

177.  For  relevant  discussion,  see  Christine  Jolls,  Accommodation  Mandates, 53  STAN.  L.
REv.  223,  227-28,  255-61  (2000).  Professor  Jolls  argues  that accommodation  mandates  might
produce  desired  redistributive  gains  whether  or  not  they  are  efficient,  and  she  supplies  a
detailed  analysis  of when  those gains  are  most likely  to occur.  See id. at 250  ("Even if  the value
of the accommodation  is  less  than its cost, the  mandate may make  disadvantaged  workers better
off  because  nondisadvantaged  workers  will  bear  some  of  the  associated  cost.").  At  present,
there is  no parallel discussion  for  regulation  of the sort  that I  am discussing here. My  suggestion
is  that  under  imaginable  assumptions,  some  regulation  will  be  defensible  on  distributive
grounds.

programs  that  benefit  them,  the  autonomy  argument  for  WTP  is
greatly  reduced;  they  are  enjoying  a  benefit  (partly)  for  free,  and  it
does not insult anyone's  autonomy  to  give  them  a good  on  terms that
they  find  acceptable.  Note  that  these  points  do  not  bear  directly  on
the  question  of  whether  VSL  should  vary  across  risks.  But  they  do
bear  on  the  issue  of  varying  VSL  across  persons,  and  in  particular
across disparities in  income  and wealth.

Suppose,  for  example,  that  beneficiaries  of  a  proposed  drinking
water  regulation  are  willing  to  pay  only  $80  to  eliminate  a  risk  of
1/50,000.  Assume,  in  addition,  that the  per-person  cost  of eliminating
a  1/50,000  risk  is  $100-but  that  for  every  dollar  of  that  cost,  the
beneficiaries  pay  only  $.80.  The  remaining  $.20  might  be  paid  by
water  companies  themselves,  in  the  form  of  reduced  profits,  or  by
employees  of the water  companies,  in  the  form of reduced  wages  and
fewer  jobs.  In  this  example,  the  costs  of the  regulation  exceed  the
benefits:  it  is  inefficient.  But  by  hypothesis,  the  regulation  makes  its
beneficiaries  better  off. If the  WTP  criterion is  used,  the  fact that  the
monetized  costs  exceed  the  monetized  benefits  is  decisive.  But  as  a
normative  matter,  the  analysis  here  is  far  harder  than  in  the  easy
cases. On what  assumption  should  the WTP numbers be  decisive?

The  assumption  must be  that  economic  efficiency  is  the  goal  of
government,  at  least  in  the  context  of regulation-that  to  know  what
to  do,  government  should  aggregate 
the  benefits  and  costs  of
regulation,  and  act  if and  only if  the  benefits  exceed  the  costs.  When
using  the  WTP  numbers,  government  is  acting  as  a  maximization
machine,  aggregating  all  benefits  and  costs  as  measured  by  the  WTP
criterion.  But  this  is  a  highly  contestable  understanding  of  what
government  should  be  doing.  In  fact  it  represents  a  shift  from  the
relatively  uncontroversial  Pareto  criterion,  exemplified  above,  to  a
version  of the  far  more  controversial  Kaldor-Hicks  criterion,' s  which
assesses  policy  by  asking  this question:  Are  the  gainers  winning  more
than  the  losers  are  losing?  The  Kaldor-Hicks  criterion  is  sometimes
described  as  potential  Pareto superiority,'79  because  it asks  whether  in
principle,  the  winners  could  compensate  the  losers,  and  a  surplus

178. 

It  is  only  a  version  of  that  criterion,  because  it  is  measuring  welfare  in  monetary
equivalents.  A  direct  assessment  of  welfare,  if it  were  possible,  might  justify  the  regulation  in
question  on  Kaldor-Hicks  grounds.

179.  See,  e.g.,  RICHARD  A. POSNER,  ECONOMIC  ANALYSIS  OF  LAW  13  (6th  ed. 2003)  ("The
Kaldor-Hicks  concept  is  also  and suggestively  called  potential  Pareto  superiority:  The  winners
could  compensate  the losers,  whether or not they  actually do.").

could  be  left over. The difficulty  of course  is  that  Pareto  superiority  is
merely  potential.  Some  people  really  are  losing  and  others  are
gaining.

In  these  harder  cases,  the  gainers  are  gaining  less  (in  monetary
terms)  than  the  losers  are  losing-and  hence  the  regulation  is  said  to
that  I  have  given,  the
be  unjustified.  Under  the  assumptions 
regulation  is  indeed  inefficient:  its  social  cost  is  higher  than  its  social
benefit.  But  is the  regulation  undesirable?  This  is not at  all  clear. The
first  problem  is  that  WTP  is  measuring  gains  and  losses  in  monetary
terms,  rather  than  in  welfare  terms.8'  It  is  possible  that  those  who
gain,  in the harder  cases,  gain more  welfare  than  the losers  lose;  WTP
is  not  dispositive  on 
is
distributional.  Suppose  that  in terms  of overall welfare,  the  regulation
is  not  desirable;  it  makes  aggregate  welfare  lower rather  than  higher.
But  suppose  too  that  those  who  benefit  are  less  advantaged  than
those  who  lose.  If, for  example,  those  who  are  willing  to  pay  $80  are
those  who  pay  the  remainder  are
disproportionately  poor,  and 
disproportionately  wealthy,  the  regulation might  plausibly  be justified
despite  the welfare  loss.

that  question.  The  second  problem 

It  is  natural  to  respond  here  that,  if  redistribution  is  the  goal,
then  it should be  produced not through  regulation  but through  the tax
system,  which  is  a  more  efficient  way  of  transferring  resources  to
people  who  need  help.18
1  I  agree.  But  suppose  that  redistribution  is
not  possible  through  the  tax  system.  If  so,  then  regulation  in  the
harder  cases  cannot  be  ruled  off-limits  despite  its  inefficiency.  The
fact  that  a  regulation  is  helpful  to  the  most  disadvantaged  is  not
decisive  in its  favor. If it is trivially  helpful,  and  if it inflicts  huge  costs
on  everyone  else,  little  can be  said for  it. But  everything  depends  on
the  magnitude  of the  relevant  effects.  A program  that  produced  large
gains  for  the  least  well-off  would  seem  to  be  justified  even  if  it
imposed,  in  terms  of  WTP,  slightly  higher  costs  than  benefits  on
balance.

distributional  issues,  might  eventually  persuade  them  to  do  so.1"3  A
possible  reason  for treating  the harder  cases  the same as the easy  ones
is  the  existence  of  an  optimal  income  tax.  If the  tax system  produced
the  right  level  of  redistribution,  there  would  be  good  reason  for
agencies  to  rely on  individualized  VSL  and not  to  concern themselves
with whether the  beneficiaries  of regulation  were  paying for any or  all
of  the  costs.  The  hard  cases  would  be  treated  as  the  easy  ones.  For
people  who  believe  that  the  hard  cases  must  be  treated  differently,  it
is  because further redistribution  is desirable.

Another  reason  for  treating  the  harder  cases  as  the  easy  ones
would  be  optimism:  perhaps  everything  will  balance  out  in  the  end.
Perhaps  no  group  will  be  systematically  helped  or  hurt,  and  the  tax
system  will  produce  appropriate  redistribution.  In  the  real-world
cases,  regulators  might  also  think  that  a  direct  inquiry  into  welfare,
bypassing  WTP,  would  be  extremely  difficult  or  perhaps  even
impossible 
to  operationalize.  If  distributional  considerations  are
relevant, interest-group  warfare  may  be  the consequence,  rather  than
distribution  to those  who  particularly  need  and  deserve  help.1"  More
modestly, it  might be  concluded  that  agencies  should generally  pursue
efficiency,  using  WTP  as  the  foundation  for  decisions,  but  should
allow  distributional  findings  to  cut  the  other  way  in  cases  in  which
there  is compelling  reason  to do so. In fact this  approach  is  a plausible

way  of  reading  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget's  current
guidelines on  regulatory  impact  analysis."'

In  the  easy  cases,  the  resulting  redistribution  is  almost  certainly
perverse,  because  forced  exchanges,  under  the  stated  assumptions,
are  highly likely to harm the  people who  are  being coerced.  But in  the
harder cases,  it cannot be  said  that the beneficiaries  of regulation  will
be  harmed  if  government  uses  a  number  that  exceeds  their  actual
VSLs.  Everything  depends  on 
the  distributional  effects  of  the
regulation.  If the beneficiaries  are well-off, a high VSL  might produce
perverse  redistribution  if those  who lose  are toward  the bottom  of the
economic  ladder.  It  is  possible  to  envision  this  result,  for  example,
with  a  pollution  program  that  protects  those  who  visit  expensive
recreational  areas.  In  contrast,  if the  beneficiaries  are poor,  and if the
costs  are  borne  by  the  wealthy  or  by  the  general  population,  a  high
VSL  might  be  in  the  interest  of  those  who  need  help.  Air  pollution
programs,  providing  special  protection  for people  in  cities,  appear  to
be  an  example. 186  It  is  therefore  reasonable  to  reject  the  confident
view  of  economically  inclined  analysts  who  believe  that  accurate
VSLs,  based  on  actual  WTP  (and  hence  individuated),  should  always
be  the  basis  of  regulatory  policy.  But  it  is  similarly  reasonable  to
reject  the confident  view of skeptics  who  believe  that a  uniform VSL,
refusing  to  make  distinctions  among  persons,  is  best  on  distributive
grounds.

What  are  the  implications  for  individuation  of VSL?  It  remains
true  that  according  to  the  theory  that  underlies  agency  valuations,  a
higher  degree  of  individuation  would  be  desirable.  It  also  remains
true  that  with  respect  to  risks, individuation  is  appropriate  insofar  as
valuations  differ  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  risk  at  stake.  The
principal  qualification 
that  gives
disadvantaged  people  regulatory  protection  in  excess  of  their  WTP,
might  turn  out  to  have  fortunate  distributional  consequences  in  the
harder cases.  Regulators  should be  careful  about this point. It will not

always  hold,  and  if the  goal  is  to provide  more  assistance  to those  in
need,  a  uniform  VSL  is  hardly  the  best  way  to  achieve  that  goal.
Consider the case of poor  areas  of the country:  a  national VSL of $6.1
million  would  almost  certainly  be  harmful,  simply  because 
the
resulting levels of regulation  would  have adverse  effects  on wages  and
employment  levels.  My  only point  is  that in  some  cases, individuation
across persons  will produce worse  outcomes  on distributional  grounds
and possibly on grounds  of welfare  as well.

IV.  GLOBAL RISK  REGULATION  AND CROSS-NATIONAL
VALUATIONS

The  analysis  thus  far  has  significant  implications  for  global  risk
regulation  and cross-cultural  variations  in WTP  and VSL. In  this Part,
I  turn  to  those  implications.  My  conclusion  is  that  poor  countries
should  use  a  lower  VSL  than  wealthy  countries,  and  that  people  in
poor countries  are  not helped  if the United  States, or an  international
body,  insists  on  a  high one.  But  the  analysis  must  be  different  if  the
question  is the  behavior  of donors or  donor  nations. Nations  who  are
most in need  deserve  help,  even  if their WTP  is  low. For purposes  of
regulation,  however,  insistence  on  a  high  VSL  will  not  provide  that
help.  I  begin  with  the  distinction  between  donor  practices  and
government  regulation  and  then  turn  to  the  practical  question  of
cross-national valuations.

A.  Are Indian Lives Worth Less  Than American Lives?

I  have  suggested  that people  in  poor nations  show a  lower  WTP
and  hence  VSL  than  people  in  wealthy  nations. ' 8  Because  poor
people  have less  money than rich  people, this finding  should not be  at
all  surprising.  Building  on evidence  of  this  kind, some  assessments  of
the  effects  of  global  warming  find  far  higher  monetized  costs  from
deaths  of people  in rich  countries  than  from  deaths  of people in poor
countries."8  These  assessments  have  been  highly  controversial;

Professor  John  Broome, for example,  notes  that under  one  approach,
an  American  life  is worth  ten or twenty  Indian  lives,  a judgment  that
he  deems  "absurd., 189  As  a  result,  some  analysts,  including  the
Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change,  have  opted  for  a
worldwide  VSL  of $1 million, a  choice  that  seems  quite  arbitrary  and
potentially  harmful to people in rich  and poor nations  alike.

The 

issue  raises 

important  dilemmas.  How  should  global
institutions  assess  the  monetary  value  of human  lives?  What  are  the
monetized  costs  of  ten  thousand  worldwide  deaths  from  global
warming,  deaths  that  include  eight  thousand  people  from  poor
countries  and  two  thousand  from  wealthy  ones?  The  discussion  thus
far  suggests  that  there  is  no  sensible  abstract  answer  to  these
questions;  it  is  important  to  know  what,  in  particular,  the  answer  is
for. If  a  general  question  is  asked,  outside  of any  particular  context,
about  the  monetary  value  of  a  stated  number  of deaths  in  2020,  it  is
best left unanswered  (except  perhaps  with laughter).  The  appropriate
assessments  of VSL,  and  variations  across  countries,  depend  on  their
intended  use.  If  disparate  numbers  are  meant  to  identify  the  actual
monetary values  of human  lives,  and  to suggest  that people  in Canada
are  "worth"  much more  than people  in Argentina  or that poor people
are  "worth"  less  than  rich  ones,  the  numbers  are  ludicrous  as  well  as
offensive.

It is possible  to go further. If the  disparate  numbers  are meant  to
suggest  the  appropriate  amount  that  donor  institutions  should  spend
to  reduce  mortality  risks,  they make  little  sense. The  fact that  a  poor
person  in  a  poor  nation would  be  willing  to pay  $1  to eliminate  a risk
of  1/10,000,  whereas  a  wealthy  person  in  a  wealthy  nation  would  be
willing  to pay  $100,  cannot plausibly  be  used  to  defend  the  view  that

189.  See  Broome,  supra note  182,  at  957  (noting  that  this  conclusion  is  a  product  of  "a
money-metric  utility  function  to  represent  a  person's  preferences,"  an  approach  that  Professor
Broome  rejects).  In the  easy  cases, I  suggest  that a  money-metric  utility  function  is  not  absurd,
and  it  is  not  quite  absurd  in  the  hard  cases  either.  See  INTERGOVERNMENTAL  PANEL  ON
CLIMATE  CHANGE,  supra note  188,  at 483:

The  VSL  is  generally  lower  in  poor  countries  than  in  rich  countries,  but  it  is
considered  unacceptable  by many  analysts to  impose  different values  for  a policy that
has  to be  international  in scope  and  decided  by  the  international  community.  In these
circumstances,  analysts  use  average  VSL and apply  it to all  countries.  Of course,  such
a value  is not  what individuals  would  pay for  the reduction  in  risk, but it is  an  "equity
adjusted"  value,  in which  greater weight is  given to  the  WTP of  lower income  groups.
On  the basis of EU  and US  VSLs  and a  weighting system  that has  some broad  appeal
in  terms  of  government  policies  towards  income  distribution,  Eyre  et  al.  (1998)
estimate  the  average  world  VSL  at  around  1  million  Euros  (approximately  US$1
million  at 1999 exchange  rates).

an  international  agency  should  devote  its  resources  to  the  latter
rather  than  the  former.  To  illustrate  this  point,  imagine  choosing
between  two programs:

(A)  Program  A  would  eliminate  (at  a  stated  cost  of  $500)  a
1/10,000  risk  faced  by  fifty poor people  in  Costa  Rica,  each
willing to pay $2  to eliminate that risk.

(B)  Program B  would eliminate  (also  at  a stated  cost  of $500)  a
1/10,000  risk  faced  by  fifty  wealthy  people  in  Germany,
each  willing to pay  $350 to eliminate  that same risk.
In  principle,  there  is  no  reason  to  think  that  a  donor  should
prefer  to save the  Germans,  even though their  WTP  is far  higher than
that of the Costa  Ricans. In fact,  Program A  has much higher priority,
because  it  would  help  people  who  were  facing  extreme  deprivation.
What is true at the individual level  is true across  nations as well.

But  now  consider  a  different  issue.  The  government  in  a  poor
nation  is  deciding  on  appropriate  policy  to  reduce  workplace  risks;
what  VSL  should  it  use?  At  least  under the  assumptions  that  I have
given thus far,  such a government  would do well  to begin by using the
admittedly  low WTP of its own citizens.  If citizens in  that nation show
a  WTP  of  $2  to  eliminate  risks  of  1/10,000,  then  their  government
does  them  no  favors  by  requiring  them  to  pay  $50  or  $10  for  that
protection.  This  is  the  sense  in  which  VSL  properly  varies  across
nations,  and  in  which  citizens  of  poor  nations  have  lower  VSLs  than
citizens  of wealthy  ones.

for 

international 

The  point  has  strong  implications 

labor
standards. It is tempting to suggest  that workers  in poor countries,  for
example  China and India, should  receive the  same protection  as  those
in  the  United  States;  why  should  a  worker  in  Beijing  be  subject  to
significantly  higher death risks  than a worker in Los  Angeles?  So long
as the  distribution of global income  has the form that it does, a system
that  gives  Chinese  workers  the  same protection  as  American  workers
is  not  in the  interest  of  Chinese  workers-assuming,  as I  am,  that the
cost  of  that  protection  is  borne  by  workers  themselves.  Requiring
Chinese  workers  to have  the  same  protection  as  Americans  amounts
to a forced  exchange  on  terms that Chinese  workers  reject.

In  these  circumstances  it is  unsurprising  that  workers  in  wealthy
nations,  not  in  poor  ones,  often  clamor  the  loudest  for  greater
protection  of workers  in  poor  nations;  workers  in  wealthier  nations
would  be  the principal  beneficiaries  of such  regulation,  which  would
protect  them  against  competition  from  those  in  poorer  nations.  The

idea  that workers  in poor  nations should  have  the  "same"  protection
as  workers  in  wealthy  nations  is  an  error,  rooted  in  a  "moral

to  help.  In  the  hard  cases, 

If  the  Chinese  government  uses  a  VSL  of  $6  million,  on  the
theory  that its citizens  should not be valued  less  than those  of wealthy
nations,  social  harm  will  almost  inevitably  result.  In  the  easy  cases,
the  forced  exchanges  will  be  ludicrously  harmful  to  the  people  whom
the
they  are  supposed 
beneficiaries  pay  only a fraction  of the  cost  (which is  mostly  borne  by
others  in  the  same  nation),  the  nation will  be  spending  far too  much
of  its  money  on  risk  reduction  (or  more  precisely,  on  reducing  the
risks  that happen  to  get  onto  the regulatory  agenda).  The inefficiency
of  an  extremely  high  VSL  will  be  felt  acutely  and  in  many  forms,
including  decreased  employment.  But  if  the  costs  of  risk  reduction
will  be  paid  by  third  parties-for  example,  wealthy  nations-then
people  in  the  poor  country  will  be  helped  even  if  risk  reduction  is
based  on  an excessive  VSL.

in  which 

Of course  the citizens  of poor  nations  would  almost  certainly  be
helped  more  if they  were  given  cash  (supposing  that  it would  not  be
squandered)  rather  than in-kind  benefits.  But  if cash  redistribution  is
not  possible,  regulatory  benefits,  provided  for  free  or  for  a fraction  of
their  cost,  remain  a  blessing.  If, for  example,  a  global  institution uses
a  worldwide  VSL  of  $1  million,  and  if  that  amount  exceeds  the
domestic  VSL  of  people  in  poor  nations,  it  is  possible  that  poor
people  will  gain  a  great  deal  if  the  resources  for  risk  reduction  are
provided  by wealthy  nations.  In  the  harder  cases,  the  simple  point  is
that  many  of  the  intended  beneficiaries  of  regulation  are  in  fact  net
gainers.

asking  some  question  about  the  aggregate  costs  of  global  climate
change  by  2050,  unless  it  has  some  particular  point.  A  far  more
sensible  question  is  whether  it  would  make  sense  for  any  particular
nation  to  accept  a  particular  way  of  responding  to  the  problem  of
climate  change,  such  as  the  Kyoto  Protocol. t  At  the  national  level,
an  assessment  of  the  costs  and  benefits  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol  is  not
much  different  from  an  assessment  of  the  costs  and  benefits  of  any
other  regulation.

For  the  United  States,  the  likely  costs  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol
greatly  exceed  its  likely  benefits.  The  anticipated  costs  are  $325
billion,192  an  amount  that  might  be  worthwhile  if  the  anticipated
benefits  for  the  United  States  were  in  the  ballpark  of  that  number.
But  the  overall  benefits  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol  are  small  because  the
mandatory  emissions  reduction  would  make  only  a  slight  dent  in
global  warming.9  In  the  United  States,  the  benefits  could  not
possibly  justify  the  costs."9  The  picture  for  the  world  as  a  whole  is
more  mixed,  with  Europe  anticipated  to  be  a  net  gainer.19 '  But  even
for the  world, the Kyoto  Protocol  appears  to impose  costs in  excess of
benefits-and  this  is  so  even  if  improbable  catastrophic  risks  are
taken  into  account.  The  only  qualification  here  is  that  the  science  of
global  warming  is  disputed;  if  this  is  a  realm  of  uncertainty  rather
than  risk, and  if worst-case  scenarios  are emphasized,  then  the  Kyoto
Protocol  might  provide  a  sensible  impetus  toward  technological
innovation  and  far more  dramatic reductions.

For  wealthy  nations,  of  course, the  argument  for  contributing  to
the  reduction  of  global  warming  is  strengthened  by  the  fact  that  the
harms  of  global  warming  will  be  felt  disproportionately  in  poor
nations-and  also  by  the  fact  that  wealthy  nations  have  done  by  far
the  most  to  produce  the  situation  that  makes  global  warming  a
serious  problem.  Hence  it is  reasonable  to say  that  the  United  States
should join  international  agreements  to combat  global  warming  even
if it loses  more  than  it gains.  The  problem  with the  Kyoto Protocol  is

that  it combines  extremely  high  global  costs with relatively  low global
benefits,  even  if  the  problem  of  global  warming  is  taken  quite
seriously.  A sensible  approach  would control  emissions  in  developing
countries,  so  as  to  increase  the  overall  benefits,  and  also  would  use
emissions  trading  and  other  strategies  to  reduce  the  overall  costs.
These  routes  could  certainly  produce  sensible  agreements  to  address
climate  change.196  To  the  extent  that emissions  control in  developing
countries  would  impose  a  significant  burden,  wealthy  nations  should
help  to foot the  bill.

But  I  am  not  attempting  here 

to  resolve  any  particular
controversy.  My  major  suggestions  are  that  within  nations,  diverse
VSLs  are  perfectly  sensible,  and  that  answers  to  questions  about
valuation  must  be  closely  attuned  to  the  purposes  for  which  those
questions  are  being  asked.

CONCLUSION

The  theory  that  animates  current  valuations  of  mortality  risks
argues  in  favor  of  far  more  individuation.  Does  the  risk  involve
cancer?  What  kind  of cancer?  Does it involve  air  pollution  or driving
on  the  highways?  If welfare  and  autonomy  are the  guides,  it is  obtuse
to  adopt  an  approach  that  values  all  statistically  equivalent  mortality
risks  in  the  same  way.  In  addition, individuals  display  a  great  deal  of
heterogeneity  in  their  VSLs-not  simply  because  of  different  tastes
and  values,  but also  because  of different  levels  of income  and  wealth.
WTP  depends  on  ability  to  pay.  Nothing  that  I  have  said  here  is
meant  to  suggest  approval  of  existing  distributions  of  resources.
Certainly  poor  people  are  not  "worth  less"  than  wealthy  ones,  and  it
is  often  appropriate  for  government  to  provide  resources  directly  to
poor  people  or  subsidize  the  provision  of  regulatory  benefits.  But
forced  exchanges  are  not  a  good  way  to  assist  poor  people,  and  a
uniform  VSL  is  often  a  perverse  response  to  inequality.  In  theory,
risk-reduction  policies  should  be  more  fully  individuated,  giving  all
people  regulatory  protection  that  corresponds  to  their  WTP  for  the
particular risk in question.

Of course  this is  not practicable.  Government  lacks  the  necessary
information  about  individual  risk  preferences;  categorical  judgments
are  inevitable.  In  any  case  many  of  the  benefits  provided  by

regulation  are  collective  in  character.  Regulators  cannot  feasibly
provide  protection  to  one  person  without  simultaneously  providing
protection  to  many.  But  it  is  nonetheless  important  to  see  what  the
current  theory  counsels  in  principle,  and  to  understand  that  the
limitations  are  practical  ones,  some  of  which  may  be  overcome  as
knowledge  progresses.  Even  with  the  practical limitations,  a  uniform
VSL is  increasingly  difficult to justify.

It  is  clear  that  some  risks  produce  a  higher  VSL  than  others,
resulting in  significantly different analyses  in many cases,  above  all  by
producing  a  higher  VSL  for  cancer  risks.  A  program  that  protects
elderly  people  should  produce  a  lower  VSL  than  one  that  protects
younger people,  and there  is no  ethical  objection  to  variations  on  the
basis  of  age.1 7 If  a  program  affects  mostly  wealthy  people,  a  VSL
based on  the population-wide  median  will be  too low.  It would  follow
that the FAA  should have  a relatively  high VSL, because people  who
fly  are  wealthier  than the  population  median-and  when  the  EPA is
engaging  in  cost-benefit  analysis for  programs  protecting  poor  people
from  risks  associated  with  hazardous  waste  sites,  it  should  have  a
relatively  low VSL.

The  principal  qualification 

is  that  when  the  beneficiaries  of
regulation  do  not pay  all  of  its  cost,  a  high  VSL  may  actually  be  in
their interests. The  easy  cases, in which the beneficiaries  are forced  to
pay  for  regulatory  benefits,  are  not  the  same  as  those  in  which
beneficiaries  pay  only  a  fraction  of  the  cost.  Nonetheless,  current
practice  treats  such  cases  as  identical,  perhaps  because  of  the  great
difficulty in untangling  the  incidence  of regulatory  benefits  and costs.
My goal has  not been  to resolve  that difficulty,  but to suggest  that the
theory behind  current practice justifies  far more individuation  of VSL
than  regulators  currently  provide.  However  regulators  deal  with
distributional  problems  and  the  hardest  cases,  the  use  of  a  uniform
VSL is unacceptably  obtuse.

. about 30-40  percent  lower than  the market  average  and between  one-third and one-half  the
size  of the  VSLs  for  prime-aged  workers.");  Sunstein, supra note  8,  at 210  ("If thirty-year-olds
are  willing  to  pay  more  (or  less)  to  eliminate  a  statistical  risk  than  sixty-year-olds,  then  the
difference  should  be  reflected 
[P]olicymakers  should  use different  values  for  old  people  and young  people if and  only if WTP
studies  show  such  a  disparity.").  I  am  putting  to  one  side  the difficult  questions  raised  by  the
need to produce  a VSL for  children.
