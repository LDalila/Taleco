An experimental study of punitive damage awards in personal injury cases was conducted, using jury-eligib respondents. There was substantial consensus on judgments of the outrageousness of a defendant's actions and of the appropriate severity of punishment. Judgments of dollar awards made by individuals and synthetic juri were much more erratic. These results are familiar characteristics of judgments made on unbounded magnitude Some judgmental tasks are far easier than others for juries to perform, and reform possibilities should exploit
A system of justice must make distinctions: it should treat alike cases that are relevantly alike, and it should treat differently cases that are relevantly different. A system that metes out erratic and unpredictable punishments for similar transgressions fails to satisfy the first of these criteria. A system that provides crude punishments poorly linked to the distinctive features of particular cases fails to satisfy the second. Many critics have charged that the system of punitive damages is prone to such failures (e.g., Jeffries, 1986 Huber, 1989). We use the terms 'erratic' and 'unpredictable' interchangeably in this article, both in a rather unusual sense: we imagine a legal expert trying to anticipate the award that will be made in a particular case, either by considering similar cases in the past, or by examining the responses of a mock jury. The confidence that the expert may reasonably attach to her opinion about the outcome of the case depends on how much the decisions of different juries considering the same case are likely to differ. If they do not treat the similarly situated similarly, awards that are in this sense erratic or unpredictable are unjust they are also inefficient from the economic point of view, because they impose an unnecessary

The variables listed under 'case features' in an action that determine the intensity of o figure represents outrage as basic, and puniti by additional factors. This representation is rage are a proper subset of the case features affect punitive intent independently of o suffered by the victim and the relationship the judgment. The description of an action can evoke outrage without any information about the harm that it caused. However, the harm that an action caused is a factor in punitive intent. This retributive aspect of punishment is incorporated in many aspects of the law, such as the large discrepancy between the sentences for murder and for attempted murder. The relationship between victim and juror was manipulated in an experiment by Hastie, Schkade and Payne (1997) awards were larger when the plaintiff was located in the jurors' community than when the plaintiff was from a remote location. We speculate that the retributive urge is stronger when the victim belongs to one's group than when the victim is a stranger. Although punitive intent is affected by some factors that do not affect outrage, our general hypothesis is that most of the determinants of the two states are shared - and we therefore expect them to be highly correlated. In some situations the expression of an attitude is not spontaneous, but is restricted to a particular scale of responses. Stringent constraints apply, for example, when respondents in opinion surveys are asked to indicate the extent of their agreement or disagreement with a particular statement. In the situation with which we are concerned here, the responses of juries dealing with punitive awards are restricted to a scale of dollars. The

features of the dollar scale, different punitive awards.
1.2. The study
We designed a study to test several implications of the outrage model. Respondents were given a set of vignettes of personal injury cases in which a plaintiff (always an individual) sued a firm for compensatory and punitive damages. The respondents were told to assume in all cases that compensatory damages had been awarded in the amount of $200,000, and that punitive damages were to be considered. Different groups provided different judgments of these scenarios. Respondents in the outrage condition were asked to rate the outrageousness of the defendant's behavior. Respondents in the punishment condition rated how severely they wished to punish the defendant. Finally, respondents in the dollar award condition were asked to assess the amount of punitive damages (if any) that should be awarded. We examined the following hypotheses:
(1) The outrage evoked by scenarios of tortious behavior is governed by broadly
shared social norms. The ranking of different scenarios by their outrageousness is
expected to be generally similar for different demographic groups (See Section 3.1.3). (2) Punitive intent is determined by the outrageousness of the defendant's behavior
and by other case factors, prominently including the harm suffered by the plaintiff. The prediction that harm affects punitive intent but not outrage was tested by
presenting alternative versions of some scenarios, in which the severity of the harm
suffered by the plaintiff was varied (See Section 3.1.4). (3) Damage awards are determined by punitive intent and by specific mapping factors, prominently including the size of the defendant firm. This prediction was
tested by presenting each scenario in two versions, in which the size of the defendant
was varied (See Section 3.1.5). (4) Large individual differences in the use of the dollar scale reduce the precision
with which population norms for punitive awards can be estimated from the
judgments of small samples of respondents, such as juries. This hypothesis was
tested in two ways. First, we compared the amount of measurement error in ratings of
punitive intent on a category scale and in dollar awards. Second, we predicted that
transformations of dollar awards that remove individual differences in scale usage
(e.g, transforming each individual's responses to ranks) would result in a sharp reduction in unsystematic variability. The rationale for this prediction is that such
transformations eliminate the skewness and reduce the arbitrary variability associated
with the dollar scale but retain the ordinal correspondence of punishments to punitive
intentions (See Sections 3.2 and 3.3.1). (5) Because there is less error variance in ratings of punitive intent than in dollar
awards, these ratings are a more accurate predictor of community sentiment
about appropriate dollar awards than dollar awards themselves. The dollar award

that a jury makes in a particular case can sentiment about the appropriate award, w judgments in the population. It is possibl intent could provide a more accurate estim the precision of estimates based on judg ratings (See Section 3.3.2).
2.1. Sample and procedure
The sample consisted of 899 jury-eligible respondents who were recruited from the Travis County, Texas voter registration list by a professional survey firm and paid $35 for their participation. The resulting sample had good representation from various demographic and socio-economic groups. For example, respondents were 44% male 64% Caucasian, 16% African- American, 15% Hispanic median income = $30K-$50K median education = Some College median age = 30-39. Thirty-two respondents were dropped from the sample because they gave incomplete responses or failed to understand the task. The survey was conducted at a downtown hotel. Participants were run in large groups at pre-arranged times over a four day period. Most respondents completed their task in 30 to 45 minutes. Each respondent received three pages of general instructions and four numbered envelopes. The first three envelopes contained the materials for Parts 1 , 2 and 3 of the study, as described below. The fourth envelope contained demographic questions and debriefing information. The instructions (which are excerpted in Appendix I) included (1) an overview of the survey procedure, (2) an explanation of the task of jurors in civil (as opposed to criminal) trials, (3) definitions of and distinctions between compensatory and punitive damages, including the fact that compensatory damages had already been awarded in the cases they would consider, (4) a summary of standard legal conditions for punitive damages (maliciousness or reckless disregard for the welfare of others), and (5) a reminder about the standard of evidence required in this situation (preponderance of the evidence).
2.2. Design and stimuli
Ten scenarios describing personal injury cases were constructed (summarized in Table 1 full versions in Appendix II). The first six were used in Parts 1 and 2 of the procedure and the other four in Part 3. Each respondent rated some version of all ten scenarios. Envelope #1 contained material about one of the first six scenarios. Envelope #2 contained the other five of these six scenarios. Envelope #3 contained the four scenarios used in Part 3 of the experiment. In Parts 1 and 2, between-subjects manipulations were response mode (Outrage, Punishment or $ Damages) and firm size (annual profits of $10-$20 million (Medium) or

Scenario order was counterbalanced so that each scenario appeared in each ordinal position with equal frequency. Table 2 shows the wording of the evaluation questions in the three response modes.

We discuss the results in three parts. Section 3.1 is concerned with the validity of the outrage model shown in Figure 1. Section 3.2 deals with the predictability of dollar damage awards, and with the role of individual differences. Section 3.3 considers the question of unpredictability at the level of juries. We examine the hypothesis that variability in the individuals' use of the dollar scale is sufficient to be a major cause of unpredictability in jury awards.
3.1. The outrage model
The analyses in this section examine some of the social norms that govern evaluations of the actions of firms and the intended severity of punishment for harmful negligence. They focus on the average judgments of the general public (as represented in our sample), and of sub-populations within it.
3.1.1 . Preliminary analysis: The effect of context. Unlike real jurors, who are exposed to a single case for a long time, the participants in our study responded to a total of 10 personal injury cases in quick succession, and had an opportunity to compare these scenarios to each other. To examine the effect of this unusual procedure, every participant first encountered one of the first six scenarios in Table 1, which was presented in a separate envelope and was evaluated in isolation from the others (Part 1). The experimental design provides a comparison of the distribution of judgments to each scenario when it is judged in isolation or in the context of other scenarios. The context was provided in envelope 2, where subjects were instructed to read through all five scenarios therein before responding to any one. In addition, of course, each subject had already responded to the scenario they encountered in envelope 1, which also contributed to the context. The relevant data are summarized in Table 3, which shows the mean outrage and punishment judgments and median dollar awards for each scenario in the isolation and in the context conditions.
To test whether the availability of a context altered intuitions, we computed rankcorrelations (N = 12) over the scenarios of Table 3, between the judgments in the isolation condition and in the context condition. The correlations are high: .88, and .90, respectively, for the means of outrage and punishment ratings, .89 for the medians of dollar awards.
We also examined whether the availability of a context of comparison affected the distribution of judgments. Except for a small but significant increase in the severity of punishment in the context condition (i = 3.19,/? .01), the means of judgments made in

isolation and in context are also similar. The most consistent effect of a context of similar cases is to increase the range of the judgments of different scenarios. The variances of mean judgments of outrage and punishment over the 12 scenarios are larger in the context condition. In a test for a difference between correlated variances, the effect of context is significant for the punishment condition (F(l,10) = 6.87, p .05), and marginally significant for outrage (F = 4.07, p .10). The results for a similar comparison of the medians of dollar awards are similar (F = 4.64,/? .10). The availability of a context apparently makes a serious case appear more serious than it would on its own, and makes a milder case appear milder. The small effect of a comparison context in improving discriminations among cases could be useful in the design of possible reforms of the jury's task. However, the fact that the effect of context is small allows us to generalize the conclusions of the present experiment with some confidence to situations in which no context is provided (the standard case for real juries) or to situations in which other scenarios might be used.
3.1.2. Average judgments of scenarios. Table 4 presents measures of central tendency for the three types of response (outrage, punishment and awards) for each of the scenarios presented in the experiment.

In summary, we have evidence of a remarkable degree of consensus on the relative outrage evoked by scenarios of personal injury and on the relative severity of the punishment that is considered appropriate in this class of cases. This conclusion may not fully generalize to all domains of the law. We might expect to find much larger differences in the level of judged severity between communities and social categories in other areas, perhaps including attitudes to sexual harassment and civil rights violations, although there could still be agreement across categories on the relative severity of different instances within a domain.
3.1.4. From outrage to punishment: The harm effect. In the outrage model of Figure 1, morally objectionable actions evoke a graded response of outrage or indignation. An action can be judged more or less outrageous without reference to its consequences. Consequences, however, are important to punishment in law, and we suspected that they would also be important to lay intuitions about the proper punishment for reprehensible actions. This prediction was tested in Part 3 of the questionnaire, where different respondents encountered versions of the same scenario that differed in the harm that the plaintiff had suffered.
The results are summarized in the three panels of Figure 2. In each panel, the mean response to each high-harm scenario is plotted against the mean response to the low-harm version of the same scenario. Because outrage is assumed to be independent of consequences, our model predicts that the points should fall near the identity line. This prediction is confirmed. An analysis of variance shows no main effect of harm on outrage ratings. A different pattern is found for the punishment measure, which is displayed in the middle panel of Figure 2. Here the points all fall above the identity line, indicating that punishment ratings reflect the severity of the harm as well as the outrageousness of the action that caused it. The effect of harm is small, but statistically reliable ( F = 7.4 , p .01). Because the outrage model involves a cascade of judgments, the effect of harm on

narios would be the only source of variance in judgments - in this ideal situation there is only signal, no noise. In a non-ideal world, however, we expect to observe variance from two other sources: (1) individual differences in the average response to scenarios, and (2) "noise," which combines idiosyncratic responses of individuals to particular scenarios with pure measurement error. The proportion of total variance that is accounted for by scenarios provides a useful index of the extent to which judgments approximate the ideal of complete consensus. Table 6 presents the values of this index for the three responses used in the present study, and for some transformations of these responses. To produce the values shown in Table 6, separate analyses of variance were conducted for each group of respondents who were exposed to the same combination of 10 of the 28 different scenarios. The values shown are a weighted average of the results obtained in these homogeneous groups. Ratings of outrage and punishment show much higher consensus than dollar awards. Indeed, only 6% of the variance of dollar awards is associated with scenarios. Similar results were reported by Kahneman and Ritov (1994), who compared willingness to pay for various causes (a magnitude sale) to category scale measures of related attitudes.
Dollar awards exhibit all the characteristics that are expected of magnitude scaling without a modulus, where each respondent in effect adopts a personal modulus. Individual differences in this modulus combined with the proportionality between individual means and standard deviations are expected to produce a high correlation between the mean and the standard deviations of respondents' judgments: if two individuals agree in their underlying impressions but their moduli differ by a factor, both the means and the standard deviations of their expressed judgments will differ by the same factor. For each group of respondents who saw the same set of 10 scenarios we computed the correlation between the mean and the standard deviation of the 10 responses made by each individual. As expected, this correlation was very high for dollar awards (an average of correlation of .90), but small for outrage ratings and (an average of .16) and punishment ratings (an average of .09).
Second, we observe that the distributions of awards are highly skewed to the right, for each of the 28 scenarios. We trace the skewness to two sources: the characteristic skewness of all magnitude judgments (Stevens, 1975), and the skewness in the distribution of personal moduli. We computed skewness statistics for non-zero awards for each scenario

There is no reason to believe that our main findings would be altered by the process of group deliberation. The conclusion of a now considerable literature using a wide variety of tasks is that deliberating groups hold no generalized advantage over individuals in the performance of judgment tasks (Kerr, MacCoun and Kramer, 1996). More specifically, Kerr, MacCoun and Kramer (1996) concluded from their review of judgmental biases in legal contexts that jury deliberations were actually slightly more likely to amplify the biases of individuals than to attenuate them. In the jury damage assessment context, Diamond and Casper's (1992) mock jury awards were significantly higher than the mean individual award (by 26%), a finding mirrored qualitatively in other studies (Davis, 1996, experiment 1 Kaplan and Miller, 1987, for punitive but not compensatory damages). If this effect applies to our study as well, the right-skewed distribution of damage awards in our data would cause our synthetic jury judgments to underestimate both the mean and the variance of the awards that that deliberating juries would have made. However, in a study with student mock-jurors Davis et al (1997) found that the median somewhat overestimated actual group judgments. While the relationship between individual judgments and that of the groups they compose is still an evolving area of research, this evidence suggests that the results we observe in our synthetic juries provide a reasonable and conservative approximation to the results that would be observed with real juries. We created synthetic juries by randomly selecting groups of 12 respondents, with replacement, in each condition and for each scenario, and used the median of the 12 responses to represent the jury judgment (the size of the pool from which juries were drawn varied from 144 to 151 in Part 1-2 scenarios and from 64 to 77 in Part 3 scenarios). One thousand simulated juries were created in this fashion for each scenario and condition.

Th and the observed median dollar award for each scenario were summed across the 100 juries. Finally, we computed for each scenario the ratio of the RMSE for dollar awards to the RMSE for converted punishment ratings. The last column of Table 7 presents these ratios, which we use as a summary statistic of the relative accuracy of the two estimation procedures. As is apparent from the large ratios (the median ratio is 2.18), the estimates derived from punishment ratings are far more accurate than estimates from dollar awards. For example, for the case of Joan with a medium firm size and high harm, the ratio is 2.27 (Table 7), the median individual award is $1,000,000 (Table 4), and the estimates of dollar juries have an average error from this value of $913,481 compared to $402,414 for estimates based on punishment juries. A difference in this direction was found for 25 of the 28 scenarios. These results support the rather counter-intuitive conclusion that the goal of estimating community sentiment about dollar awards can be achieved more efficiently by asking juries to rate their intent to punish than by asking them to set dollar awards provided of course that the requisite conversion function is available.
The research we have reported was designed with three objectives in mind: (i) to learn about the psychology of punitive damages (ii) to understand why punitive damages are sometimes arbitrary and unpredictable (iii) to consider possible reforms in the task assigned to the jury, which might reduce this uncertainty. We discuss the three objectives in turn.
4.1. The psychology of damage awards
We have presented a model in which judgments about punitive awards are interpreted as a succession of mappings. The core of the model is an emotion of outrage, which we have

A more difficult question concerns the circumstances of the present experiment propose, is that actual juries and the partic mapping punitive intent onto an unbounde them. Under these circumstances we expect susceptible to any anchors that may be pr deliberations. A final note of caution is in order here. The fact that punitive damages share the known deficiencies of magnitude scaling is likely to be a significant cause of unpredictable punitive awards - but it is not the only one. Other relevant factors include regional differences, plaintiffs demand, the quality of the lawyers on both sides, and doubtless others.
4.3. Implications for legal reform
In spite of the acknowledged limitations of our experiment, we believe that our findings have substantial implications for reforms of the role of juries in setting punitive awards. Of course the decision of whether and how the current system should be reformed must be guided by a normative analysis of the social and legal function of punitive damages. In the subsequent discussion we distinguish among three canonical positions, which differ in the diagnosis of the principal weakness of the current system, and imply different recommendations for how it might be improved. The issues raised in the following sections are discussed in greater detail in Sunstein, Kahneman and Schkade (1998). In that paper, we also discuss other reform proposals, such as damage caps, compensatory damage multipliers, and an increased supervisory role for judges.
4.3.1. High variability of dollar awards. The first and least radical of the three positions we shall discuss assumes that the only problem with the punitive awards made by juries is that they are erratic and unpredictable, because of the large individual differences between jurors in the mapping of punitive intent into dollars. In this view the "community sentiment" about the appropriate dollar punishment in a case is the normative standard. The task of the jury is simply to reflect this sentiment, which we have operationalized here as the median of the judgments that would be made if the entire eligible popúfation participated in setting dollar awards. The problem of unpredictability arises from an identifiable source: a sample of twelve is too small to provide an accurate estimate of community sentiment, because of the large individual differences in the mapping of punitive intent. The goal of reform is merely to obtain a more accurate understanding of that sentiment.
How might this problem be solved? The analysis that we described in Section 3.3.2 showed that asking juries to assess severity of punishment, and converting this assessment to dollars by a conversion function leads to much greater accuracy (by a factor of more than 2 in these data) than asking juries to set dollar awards. The procedure of this

4.3.2. Inadequate calibration of dollar awards. A more radical critique would argue that the legal system should deny the normative status of community sentiment about dollar awards, but accept community sentiment about punitive intent. If the translation of punitive intent onto the dollar scale is arbitrary and poorly informed, the goal of the jury system should not be to predict community sentiment about dollars - even if this prediction could be made accurate.
On this view, the conversion functions that take punitive intent to dollars (see Figure 4) reflect intuitions about appropriate dollar awards that are neither informed nor particularly reasonable. Even if it is granted that the jury is sovereign is deciding how much an

We have shown that the difficulty of mapp potentially important source of unpredictab dollar response contrasts with another imp ment in the population with respect to judgm consensus operates across differences of g substantial consensus on outrage and puniti awards are much less so. This finding leads naturally to some specific reform proposals. In particular, it suggests that any effort to improve predictability in the award of punitive damages will be most successful if it assists with the task of mapping outrage and punitive intent onto a dollar scale. A conversion formula might well be adopted to provide this assistance. The content of the conversion formula depends on the normative status that is accorded to community sentiments. As we have seen, different recommendations for reform emerge from three different diagnoses of the problem: (i) dollar awards are susceptible to excessive sampling error (ii) the mapping of punitive intent to dollars is poorly informed (iii) the judgments of jurors are likely to be affected by outrage and by retributive urges that are not in line with appropriately designed legal principles. Our findings have implications well beyond the area of punitive damages, because the legal system is pervasively in the business of requiring people to map normative judgments onto dollar amounts. Our analysis suggests that the mapping of attitudes onto unbounded scales creates problems that are both predictable and severe. We suspect, for instance, that similar difficulties exist in the setting of awards for pain and suffering, libel, and civil rights violations, and in attempts to use measures of willingness to pay to estimate the value of public goods.6 There is a need to develop mechanisms for eliciting social preferences and values that do not suffer from the problems and defects identified here. We do not expect to find an uncontroversial way of eliciting, or constructing, social preferences and values, but some approaches to this important task are demonstrably worse than others, because they make people perform tasks for which they are illequipped. The problems we have identified and the solutions we have sketched here are likely to be relevant to many questions currently facing law and policy.

Frank Williams suffered serious internal injuries when the braking system on his motorcycle failed to work at a traffic light. He felt that that the brakes were defective, and sued National Motors, the company that manufactures and sells his motorcycle. The jury (of which you are a member) ordered National Motors to pay him $200,000 in compensation. National Motors is a large company (with profits of $100-200 million per year) that makes motorcycles, scooters, and other motorized single person vehicles. The evidence showed that the braking system used by National Motors has a basic design defect. National Motors was aware that "there might be a problem with our brakes," because in pre-market tests, the defect appeared on several occasions. But the pre-market tests were not extensive, despite the fact that auto industry regulations require elaborate testing. Internal company documents show National Motors' belief that "it would be quite expensive for us to do much more now, we can't be certain we have a serious problem here, and anyway we can fix the problem afterwards if it really does turn out to be serious."
While he was visiting the circus, Thomas Smith was shot in the arm by a security guard who mistakenly thought that Smith had threatened another customer with bodily harm. The security guard was drunk at the time. Smith sued Public Entertainment, the company that operates the circus. The jury (of which you are a member) ordered Public Entertainment to pay him $200,000 in compensation. Public Entertainment is a large company (with profits of $100-200 million per year) which operates circuses and public fairs. Fred Williams, the security guard who was involved in the incident, is an alcoholic with a history of incidents of drunkenness on the job. During one of these incidents Williams took out his gun and started waving it around wildly, but he did not shoot anyone. Public Entertainment had repeatedly warned Williams

Carl Sanders used Nalene, an over-the-counter baldness treatment available at drugstores. While a small amount of hair did grow back, he also developed severe side-effects, including open sores on the scalp and permanent brown spots over his forehead. He sued the manufacturer, A&G Cosmetics. The jury (of which you are a member) ordered A&G Cosmetics to pay him $200,000 in compensation. A&G Cosmetics is a large company (with profits of $100-200 million per year) that sells many different cosmetic products, including wigs, "weaves" and chemical solutions designed to combat baldness. Nalene has proven effective in promoting hair growth in 30% of people in clinical trials. However, Nalene caused unpleasant side effects in some cases, although none were as severe as those Carl Sanders experienced. When marketing Nalene, A&G Cosmetics did not fully disclose these findings. It only said "minor side effects have been observed in a very small number of people tested." While this amount of disclosure was within legal limits, other companies that make hair products voluntarily disclosed more about their products.
PUNITIVE DAMAGES 8 1
Susan Douglas suffered significant injuries to her legs and neck when an airbag in her car opened unexpectedly while she was driving the vehicle. She believes that the airbag was defective and sued the manufacturer, Coastal Industries. The jury (of which you are a member) ordered Coastal Industries to pay her $200,000 in compensation. Coastal Industries is a large company (with profits of $100-200 million per year) that specializes in parts and accessories that can be added to existing vehicles, such as adding the latest safety equipment to older cars. While its airbag conforms to the requirements stated in government regulations, it does not include certain additional "fail-safe" systems that are used in other airbags to ensure against accidental opening. Internal documents show that most but not all of the Coastal Industries designers believed that their system "is certainly safe enough, even if it does not include all possible safeguards" and that their marketing department said that "there will be no market for our airbag if we raise its price by adding more safety bells and whistles."

Jack Newton, a five year old child, was playing with matches when his cotton flannel pajamas caught fire. He was severely burned over a significant portion of his body and required several weeks in the hospital and months of physical therapy. His parents sued the manufacturer of the pajamas, Novel Clothing. The jury (of which you are a member) ordered Novel Clothing to pay the Newtons $200,000 in compensation. Novel Clothing is a large company (profits of $100-200 million per year) that specializes in making clothes for children. Before marketing the pajamas, Novel conducted the tests normally used in the industry for problems like flammability, and observed no incidents like the Newtons experienced. Companies in the industry as well as federal regulators have known for a while that it is possible to add extra fire-retardant chemicals to their fabrics (in addition to those specified in current regulations), but these extra measures are not required. The process is very expensive, and no other manufacturers currently use it. Internal documents show that the management of Novel Clothing had decided that "when it comes to costly safety innovations we will follow our competitors. We don't want to be less safe than anyone else but we don't have to lead the way either."
Low harm version: Jack Newton, a five year old child, was playing with matches when his cotton flannel pajamas caught fire. His hands and arms were badly burned, and required regular professional medical treatment for several weeks.

OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES
Martin West, a right-handed disabled veteran who lived in a two story house, was seriously injured in a fall when the chain broke on his electric lift-chair (a device that allows someone to be carried up stairs in a chair that moves up and down an angled track). He fell from near the top of the stairs and tumbled awkwardly all the way to the bottom landing, damaging his spinal cord in the process. As a result he now has only partial control of his right arm, a condition which doctors believe is permanent. He sued the manufacturer of the lift-chair, MedTech Products. The jury (of which you are a member) ordered MedTech to pay him $200,000 in compensation. MedTech Products is a large company (profits of $100-200 million per year) that manufactures many types of medical equipment, including wheelchairs, car-lifts, and other devices used by the disabled. The lift-chair is a new product for MedTech, and instead of producing a new design, company engineers decided to adapt the design of the hydraulic lifts for cars already on the market. Unfortunately, there are several unique problems in designing a safe and effective lift-chair that are beyond the experience of the company's engineers. Product managers said that hiring new engineers with the proper expertise was "too expensive, and would take too long" and ordered current engineers to

1 . Except for cases at the extremes of the scale, where all respondents agree. a z-score (i.e., substract the sample mean and divide by the sample standard deviation) for each observation, cubing it, and then computing the average of these cubed z-scores. A positive value means the distribution is skewed to the right, a negative statistic means it is skewed to the left, and zero means it is symmetric. 3. Davis and his colleagues have developed a model called the Social Judgment Scheme (SJS) that may hold promise for improving on the median, but there is as yet no clear evidence for this claim. For example, in Davis (1996) the SJS was slightly better than the median at predicting the responses of individual juries but slightly worse at predicing the overall distribution of awards. 4. On the extent to which actual punitive damage awards are unpredictable, compare Eisenberg (1997) with Polinsky (1997). 5. The observation that a context of comparable cases improves the signal/noise ratio of judgments suggests that ranking could be more useful than rating see section 3.1.1. to pay for public goods (Kahneman and Ritov, 1994).
