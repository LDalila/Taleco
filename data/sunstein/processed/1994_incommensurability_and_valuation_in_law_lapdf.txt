In this article I explore two claims and discuss their implications for law. The first claim is that human values are plural and diverse. By this I mean that we value things, events, and relationships in ways that are not reducible to some larger and more encompassing value. The second claim is that human goods are not commensurable. By this I mean that such goods are not assessed along a single metric. For reasons to be explored, the two claims, though related, are importantly different. These claims are emphatically not meant to deny the existence of grounds for evaluating private and public choices, both among kinds of valuation and among incommensurable goods. But efforts to insist on a single kind of valuation and to make goods commensurable, while designed to aid in human reasoning, actually make such reasoning inferior to what it is when it is working well.
For the moment these claims must remain obscure I will devote considerable space to the effort to make them more clear. If they are plausible, views of this sort are likely to have important implications for law. To be sure, endorsement of the two claims need not lead to any particular view about legal problems. To say that law ought to value something in a certain way, we need to make a substantive claim about some issue of the good or the right, and a mere reference to the diversity of values does not supply that claim. Nonetheless, I hope to show that debates over ways of valuing things, and over issues of commensurability, help to reveal what is at stake in many areas of the law. A unifying claim involves the expressive function of law - the law's role in reflecting and communicating particular ways of valuing human goods. Many legal debates actually involve the appropriateness of different kinds of valuation in different areas of law.
For example, a liberal society containing diverse social spheresfamilies, markets, politics, religious organizations - makes space for
different kinds of valuation. With an understanding of these diverse kinds, we will be able to see why voluntary exchanges should usually be protected, and also why they should sometimes be blocked. Some otherwise puzzling anomalies in the theory of environmental protection will take on new aspects. An understanding of diverse kinds of valuation will help shed light on certain claims about the nature of sex discrimination. I suggest that a Kantian norm, having to do with appropriate ways of valuing human beings, accounts for widespread views about abortion, the distribution of labor within marriage, sexual harassment, prostitution, pornography, surrogacy, and much else besides. With an understanding of this sort, it will be possible as well to understand some features of practical reason in law, especially in the old area of analogical thinking, but also in new areas involving the theory and practice of the regulatory state.
In pressing claims about incommensurability and diverse kinds of valuation, I have both a general target and a positive goal. The target consists of monistic theories of value, particularly as these appear in the study of law.' Monistic theories are pervasive they have a strong philosophical pedigree and, in various guises, they come up in many discussions of particular legal issues. To be sure, it may seem that few people really subscribe to such theories. Surely most people do not deny that human values are plural. But there is a distinguished tradition of thought, found in such diverse thinkers as Plato and Bentham,2 that insists that values should be seen as unitary and that human goods should be seen as commensurable. In their most austere forms, these ideas are rarely endorsed explicitly in law but more modest versions play a large role in the legal context - not simply in economic analysis,3 but also in some aspects of rights-based thinking insofar as it takes a unitary value as the basis for evaluating law.4 In any case, problems of commensurability have yet to receive sustained attention in law and it is important to see exactly how goods are diverse, and in what ways goods are incommensurable, even if some version of these claims might turn out, upon reflection, to be widely shared.
I particularly want to show some distinctive ways in which economic analysis of law, and most forms of utilitarianism as well, miss important commitments of a well-functioning legal system. I hope also to establish that a surprisingly wide range of legal disputes can be illuminated by an understanding of incommensurability and diverse kinds of valuation. The value of this enterprise consists not in dictating particular conclusions, which depend on the details, but in enabling us to see an important basis for widespread concerns and convictions. I emphasize that to see values as incommensurable, and to say that people are really disputing appropriate kinds (not levels) of valuation, is not by itself to resolve legal disputes. It is necessary to say something about the right kind - to offer a substantive theory - and to investigate the particulars in great detail, in order to make progress in hard cases in law. But an understanding of problems of incommensurability will make it easier to see what is at stake.
This article is organized into six Parts. The first three Parts explore some foundational issues. Part I describes diverse kinds of valuation and responds to the claim that we value different things in the same way. Part II offers a working definition of incommensurability. Part III discusses an important challenge to the claims in Parts I and II. It also offers some notes on the stakes, attempting to show why these issues matter.
Part IV makes general remarks about law, with particular emphasis on law's expressive function. The fifth and most detailed Part surveys areas in which an understanding of kinds of valuation and of incommensurability may affect our understanding of law. In this Part, I discuss a wide range of issues, including social differentiation, the Establishment Clause, political equality, cost-benefit analysis, contract remedies, environmental regulation, and feminism. The sixth Part ventures some preliminary remarks on the important issue of choice - choice among different kinds of valuation and choice among incommensurable goods. In the sixth Part, I also offer a few notes on the importance of the sense of tragedy in law. 782
Human beings value goods, things, relationships, and states of affairs in diverse ways.6 Begin with the distinction between instrumen-
The inadequate description will impair predictive of human behavior. It will also impair normative judgments about ethics, law, and politics. In making this latter point, I mean to reject relativist or purely conventionalist accounts of kinds of valuation'4 and to suggest that some kinds are more appropriate than others. Judgments about what is appropriate depend of course on theories of the good or the right from the bare fact that kinds of valuation are diverse, we have no basis for evaluating any legal or social practice. But it is important to have diverse kinds of valuation - indeed we could not make sense of our lives without them - and no matter what current conventions may be, some kinds are poorly suited to some contexts because they produce inferior lives. I begin to defend these controversial claims in more detail below.15 B. Conflicts Among Kinds of Valuation, with Special Reference to
Uses of Money
Conflicts among diverse kinds of valuation permeate private and public choice. Suppose that Smith has arranged to have lunch with a friend today, but that he has become very busy and perhaps would like to cancel. Suppose Smith thinks in this way: if he cancels, his friend will be disappointed, because he would like Smith's company, and also a bit insulted, because it is cavalier and disrespectful to cancel lunch at the last minute. Maybe Smith should make it up to him, or provide compensation, by offering a nontrivial cash payment. This would be a hopelessly inadequate response. A cash payment would be inconsistent with the way that someone values a friend. Even if the friend would prefer $1, or $10, or $100, or $1000 to lunch with Smith even though at some point the payment would in some sense be worth far more than the lunch and be readily accepted as an alternative the offer of cash would be perceived as an insult rather than as compensation. In this context, the difference in kinds of valuation means
that a financial exchange would be inappropriate. The kind of valuation of a friend blocks the use of otherwise acceptable grounds for
As we will see, the law is pervaded by principles of this kind - principles that forbid resort to reasons for action that are accepta- ble in other contexts.
The case is not exotic. Similar issues permeate the exceptionally complex cluster of social norms regulating the appropriate use of money as an incentive for action. For example, if an employer tells you that, as an employee performing a certain job, you must spend a month away from your home and family, you might well agree. But if someone tells you that he will pay you a monthly salary in order to persuade you to spend a month away from home and family, you will probably feel insulted and degraded, and you may well turn him down.17 This second offer reflects an inappropriate valuation of you and your family it suggests that your relationship with your family is simply up for sale. The employer's offer treats you as an object of contempt and perhaps ridicule. In the first case, the same cannot be said. Even though in the first case the relationship might be thought to have been "traded for" cash, the absence from family is a by-product of employment, rather than something brought about as an end in itself, desired for its own sake by one's boss. To see the two cases as to overlook an important distinction in the meanings of the two offers.
Or suppose that we feel awe toward something. If we do, we will not believe that it should be valued in the same way as its cash equivalent. A simple or flat judgment that a mountain is "really worth" $10 million is inconsistent with the way that we (or most of us) value the mountain. This is because the mountain is valued through a different kind of valuation from the $10 million the former produces awe and wonder, whereas the latter is for human use - though admittedly $10 million may produce a (different) sort of awe and wonder as well. These points hold even if many people might be indifferent between $10 million and the mountain in the sense that they do not
know which they would choose if both were offered even if $10 million is in some sense the right amount to invest in protection of the mountain from degradation and even if, as seems clear, infinite valuation of the mountain would be an irrational allocation of scarce social resources. The point does not suggest that pristine areas cannot be degraded. But it does have a range of important and sometimes overlooked consequences for how people involved in the legal system might think about environmental protection.'8 It also suggests that indifference curves have quite limited purposes and that they may be misleading on some important matters. It may even suggest that we should question the whole notion of indifference curves. Some people may not be "indifferent" between two goods even though they do not think that one is better than another.19
Attention to diverse kinds of valuation casts general light on the phenomenon of exchanges that are blocked by social norms. If someone offers to pay an adult neighbor to mow his lawn, the neighbor will often regard the request as an insult, because it reflects an inappropriate valuation of the neighbor. The request embodies an improper conception of what the relationship is, or of the attitude with which neighbors render services for each other. The impropriety remains even if the offeree ordinarily would regard the offered wage as a fair price for an hour of mowing services. In an extreme case, if someone asks an attractive person (or a spouse) for sexual relations in return for cash, the same would be said even more vehemently. Because of the existence of diverse kinds of valuation, we may not be able to genera- lize acontextual preferences from particular decisions. The point bears on law as well. For example, decisions not to insure certain goodsfreedom from pain and suffering, the well-being of one's children need not suggest a global judgment about whether injuries to those goods deserve compensation.20 There is often a connection between blocked exchanges and ideas about equal citizenship. The exchange may be barred by social norms or law because of a perception that, while there may be disparities in social wealth, the spheres in which people are very unequal ought not
example) sexuality or reproductive capacities on markets because economic valuation of these "things" is inconsistent with and may even undermine their appropriate kind (not level) of valuation.24 The objection is not that markets value sexuality "too much" or "too little" it is that markets value these activities in the wrong way. Judge Posner's well-known writings on the "baby market"25 do not quite address this particular objection. A judgment about the appropriate way of valuing babies must itself be defended on some basis, and such a judgment does not automatically lead to a particular view about legal rules for adoption or the sale of young children. But the question of appropriate kinds of valuation plays a major role in these debates.26
Thus far I have dealt with cases that involve objections to the kind of valuation expressed through cash payments. But we can think of many cases not involving the issue of monetary equivalence. Imagine, for example, that John treats a beautiful diamond in the same way that most people treat friends, or that Jane values a plant in the same way that most people value their children, or that Sandy values her car like most people value art or literature. All of us know people with occasional tendencies of this sort. Indeed, all of us are people with occasional tendencies of this sort. But sometimes an improper kind of valuation seems odd, or disrespectful, or even pathological - and all these in part because it makes it impossible to sustain certain sorts of desirable social relationships. Disputes over law and social norms, which are related and sometimes mutually enforcing behavioral influences, often reflect disagreements over proper kinds of valuation, with adjectives of this sort moving to the fore.
Consider, for example, the animal rights movement. Some people think that animals should be treated with dignity and respect, and not as if they exist solely for human consumption and use.27 This view need not entail the further claim that animal life is infinitely valuable.
untary exchanges.38 Much of the theory of environmental protection involves similar issues. It is not entirely accurate to say that environmentalists value pristine areas "more" than do economists. It is also important to say that environmentalists value pristine areas in a different way. Whereas economists tend to think of the environment as something for human use and exploitation,39 environmentalists tend to claim that we should view the environment with awe and wonder or value it for its own sake rather than as an instrumental good.40 The debates over pollution taxes and tradable emissions permits are partly debates over kinds of valuation.41 Of course it is unclear how these different kinds of valuation will or should affect environmental policy, a point to which I will
Second, the existence of diverse kinds of valuation does not by itself have any clear implications for law, policy, or even social attitudes. There is a difference between how people should value and how law should value. I do not claim that, because people now value relationships, events, objects, or each other in certain ways, it follows that law should adopt those diverse kinds of valuation. We need not be conventionalists. If a particular kind of valuation were really superior with respect to what is appropriately valued in public or private life, the law might well adopt that kind of valuation notwithstanding its inconsistency with prevailing social norms. A good deal of constitutional law can be taken as an effort to constrain prevailing kinds of valuation this is true both for principles of religious liberty and for antidiscrimination norms.43 Or law might embody a certain kind of valuation precisely because it is law we might think that cost-benefit analysis is appropriate for law even if we think that it is inappropriate for spouses or parents. If we are to draw conclusions about appropriate law, policy, and norms, it is because our best account of the good or the right supports a particular constellation of kinds of valuation and because we are able to show that a particular constellation makes
sense for law.44 I return to this complex issue in Part IV. Third, those who believe that goods are valued in different ways need not reject the possibility of rational choice or even some form of trade-off among them.45 On the contrary, believers in diverse kinds of valuation would do well to insist that choices occur and that they might well be judged rational or not. People choose among differently valued goods all the time, and these choices are not immune from evaluation on rational grounds. My affection for my dog and my desire for more cash reflect different kinds of valuation, but it would be quite irrational for me to allow my dog to be sold for fifty dollars. (If I were desperately poor, and if my family were ill and suffering, it could also be irrational for me to refuse to trade my dog for one million dollars, notwithstanding the presence of distinct kinds of valuation.) Someone might well sell for a price the products of her capacity to play Mozart fact that she values her capacity as something other than an incomeproducing asset. In some circumstances it would surely be irrational for a musician to refuse to perform for a fee. These claims about rationality need to be explained in some detail, but they should be sufficient to show that there may indeed be a point to deliberating about cases that involve goods that are valued in different ways.46
D. Social Science, Economics, and Diverse Kinds of Valuation
Is it useful to note that kinds of valuation are diverse and plural? Perhaps it is not. Perhaps we can make good predictions about social life simply by assuming that there is a single kind of valuation.47 On this view, a claim about diverse kinds of valuation may usefully describe people's internal lives it may have deeper psychological truth it may better account for how lives and choices are actually experienced. But it is fully dispensable for social scientists and lawyers, who can work with an assumption of "as if unitariness" - that is, who can assume that people act as if they value all things in the same way, and who can make accurate predictions with that assumption. So long as we can model choices - so long as ordinal rankings are possible social scientists need not worry about what I have said here.
norms against sale.53 Some anomalies in expected utility theory might result from diverse kinds of valuation.54 There is much more to say about these complex matters. Nothing said in this paragraph refutes the possibility of complete ordinal rankings. But we can make some progress in thinking about human behavior by examining the role of diverse valuations.
In this light, we can also make sense out of a familiar debate within the legal culture. In some subjects - contracts, torts, property people often propose that something important - like a risk to life or health - is in some deep sense equivalent to a certain amount of cash. At this point, some participant in the conversation (perhaps a student) rejects the proposal, whereupon the original speaker suggests that the resistance must depend on a claim of infinite valuation, at which point it is clear that the original proposal was correct. But perhaps the resistance rests on a claim about appropriate kinds, not levels, of valuation.55 If so, the participant who is making this claim has a lot to explain. She has to explain how to make choices among goods that are valued in different ways. But at least we will be able to understand what she is saying. We might also begin to see why it might be jarring to conceive of the various harms imposed by law as simple "costs." This formulation begs important questions and ignores qualitative distinctions. It does so by assuming a unitary kind of valuation. In that way, this formulation loads the dice - that is, it prejudices analysis by pointing it in certain controversial directions. As we will see, the point bears on the question of commensurability.56
A. A Provisional Definition
The subject of incommensurability raises many complexities, and I want to bracket at least some of the philosophical debate here, concentrating instead on what is particularly relevant to law.57 Begin with a
rough working definition, designed especially for the legal context: Incommensurability occurs when the relevant goods cannot be aligned along a single metric without doing violence to our considered judg- ments about how these goods are best characterized. Let me briefly describe the four major elements of this definition. First, by "our considered judgments," I mean our reflective assessments of how certain relationships and events should be understood, evaluated, and experienced. Such reflection involves identifying the nature and depth of various goods in our lives.
Second, the notion of a "single metric" should be understood quite literally.58 By this I mean a standard of valuation that (1) operates at a workable level of specificity (2) involves no qualitative distinctions and (3) allows comparison of different goods along the same dimension. One example of a real-world metric - indeed the most impor- tant for present purposes - is money. Ten dollars and $100 can be confidently measured by such a standard, so that ten dollars is simply a small quantity of the same thing of which $100 is a substantial amount. If two goods are fungible, they are also commensurable. Other metrics include feet, yards, pounds, and of course meters. The difference between lengths of ten yards and 100 yards, or between 1000 pounds and 400 pounds, involves no qualitative distinctions.
An important and contested utilitarian claim is that "utility" furnishes a single metric along which goods can be evaluated. Some utilitarians believe that a single metric is indeed available for ordering valuations. The great utilitarian John Stuart Mill, of course, was unwilling to commit himself fully to this view.59 I use the term metric
largely because of the special importance of the metric of dollars to law. As we will see,60 the use of a single metric is often unhelpful for law, and this point has a wide range of consequences for particular legal disputes. Under this general definition of metric, many possible criteria, but not as metrics. Kinds of valuation - love, respect, wonder, worship - embody no metric at all.61
Third, with the phrase "doing violence," I mean to suggest that the use of a single metric is inconsistent with the way certain goods are actually experienced, or tend to be experienced when people's lives are going well. The phrase is intended to show that a single metric, nominally descriptive of experience, would actually transform it, in a way that would make a great deal of difference. It would make a great deal of difference because it would elide certain qualitative differences that are important in both life and law. We might label many choices involving commensurable goods investment decisions. The decision how to invest so as to maximize expected return does indeed involve commensurable goods. Some people write as if all or most decisions have this form - as if all or most decisions are investment decisions. Some people write as if life is full of investment decisions, so that a decision made in one context will show a global, acontextual judgment about valuation.62 It is these points that I am rejecting here. If we saw all human decisions as investment decisions, we would make human ex-
ence, not "just" words.65 An argument on its behalf would call for a large-scale revision of current experience.
B. Valuation and Commensurability
What is the relationship between kinds of valuation and commensurability? It may be tempting to think that there is incommensurability if and only if diverse kinds of valuation are at work. There is an association between these two ideas.66 But they are not the same. Two points are relevant here. First and most important, cases of incommensurability can occur even within the same kind of valuation. A parent may value one child in the same way that she values another child, but the two may be incommensurably valued in the sense that they are not valued along the same metric. The valuation of one cannot be understood as simply some fraction of the valuation of another. There is nothing like fungibility. There are important qualitative distinctions. Consider in this regard the mother's dilemma in Sophie's which of her two children should be handed over to the Nazi officer? The dilemma is tragic partly because the two lives are not fungible. The mother is forced to assume personal responsibility for the loss of a life for which there is no substitute. This is a common though usually less excruciating phenomenon in the presence of multiple intrinsic goods, when we might have a single kind of valuation, or a few such kinds, without a metric for decisions. Indeed we might think that commensurability in the sense used here can occur only in the case of instrumental goods having many possible uses.
Second, some people might think that goods are commensurable even if they are valued in different ways. Consider the suggestion that a single metric is available with which to align our different kinds of valuation. For example, Mozart may be valued in a different way from Bob Dylan, but there may be a metric by which to value different composers and, along that metric, Mozart may be superior to Dylan. (I believe that any such metric would be false to our experience of music, and hence I do not think that this sort of approach will work
but I am trying here to show how the two claims might be separated.) In any case some people think that there are diverse values - pleasure from a warm sun, gratitude from unexpected kindness, and so forth while also believing that these can all be reduced to a general concept like utility, happiness, or pleasure. Utilitarians need not deny the diversity of human goods, or that pleasures and pains come in different
The claim of incommensurability is that no unitary metric accounts for how we actually think and that the effort to introduce one misdescribes experience. There is a further claim (of course requiring an independent defense) that the misdescription can yield both inaccurate predictions and bad recommendations for ethics and politics.69 It would do so even if human beings also should decide, free from metrics but equipped with reasons, in favor of some relationships and events instead of others, and even in favor of Mozart over Dylan if some such judgment becomes useful.70 Recall that incommensurability, as I have defined it, does not entail incomparability. It may be, for example, that there are describable and workable criteria for finding a composer to be good, and that these criteria, while hardly algorithmic, make it possible to say that some composers are better than others.
Indeed, it seems clear that this is the case. We can make similar arguments about hard cases in law, a point taken up in more detail below.71
C. Excluding Reasons for Action
Some of the most intriguing instances of incommensurability arise when the relevant kind of valuation not only prevents use of a single metric, but also excludes certain reasons for action altogether.72 We need to introduce here the important notion of exclusionary reasons. Sometimes social custom or law invokes a second-order reason that excludes certain first-order reasons for action, even if those reasons are perfectly legitimate in some settings. In such cases, the basic goal of the custom or laws is to prohibit people from making choices on the basis of certain identifiable considerations. Those considerations are ruled off limits they are not merely found insufficiently weighty.
Someone may, for example, value loyalty to a lover or spouse in a way that absolutely precludes the acceptance of favors, or cash, as a reason for infidelity. The kind of valuation of the person and relationship rules out a set of reasons that would be perfectly legitimate bases for action in other contexts. The particular kind of valuation is inconsistent with allowing the admission of certain otherwise conventional reasons for behaving in a certain way. The same idea permeates the legal system. Thus, for example, a jury in a tort case is not ordinarily permitted to take into account a defendant's wealth in interpreting a statute, a judge is usually not supposed to consider what she thinks a good statute would say.74 Companies may not invoke the need to inground to engage in price fixing.75 In the law of free speech, offense at the content of ideas is not a legitimate reason to regulate speech, even if the offense is very widespread and intense.76 Administrative law consists in large part of the identification of a range of statutorily irrel-
Consider a general example. One might think that, in constitutional law, intrusions on certain rights are acceptable only if government can generate an interest both of a certain type and of a certain strength.80 In an interesting discussion of the First Amendment, for example, John Rawls argues that the mere existence of a clear and present danger of some sort will not justify government suppression of speech.8' On his account, government must show a clear and present danger to the democratic order itself.82 As I read him, Rawls does not mean to argue that this is simply a greater degree of danger than any other instead he means to argue that, to regulate political speech, government needs an interest of a particular sort. Whether or not the
provements along a unitary dimension.86 If we thought, for example, that all acts were attempts to increase social utility - defined, say, as aggregate human happiness then it would be utility that would be of intrinsic value, and all else would be instrumental to it. Analysis might therefore be greatly simplified. The same is true of some understandings of maximized wealth. Often issues of incommensurability arise because of the presence of a range of intrinsic goods that are not seen as means to some other end, particularly in law.
An example may help. Of course a society cannot spend an infinite amount of resources to improve workplace safety and hence must make complex trade-offs. But many people find it jarring to hear that, in light of actual occupational choices, a worker values his life at (say) eight million dollars, or that the protection of a life is "worth" eight million dollars.87 These claims are jarring not because we believe infinite social resources should be devoted to occupational safety. The claims are jarring because of the widespread perception that a life is not instrumental to some aggregate social goal, but worthy in itself a belief in tension with applying the language of prices to human life. This is a plausible concern even if one ultimately concludes that (say) an eight million dollar expenditure is fully appropriate in cases of lives at risk. Certainly intrinsic goods do not have infinite value for purposes of law and policy. But even though they do not, the fact that we find it jarring to hear that a life is "worth" a specified amount of money is socially desirable, and not a product of simple confusion.
In sum, the recognition of an intrinsic good may entail an evaluative attitude that is incompatible with the use of certain reasons to tal - values at stake in a parent-child relationship generally preclude compromising that relationship for cash, unless, perhaps, the cash can be used for other important intrinsic goods. The same may well be true of equal liberty or of much of what falls within the category of rights. Commensurability will not obtain in a world of multiple intrinsic goods, which is emphatically not to say that we do not choose among intrinsic goods, or that rationality does not help in selecting various courses of action.
D. Incommensurability and Freedom It might be tempting to think that incommensurability works as a barrier to certain forms of freedom - to the use of a single metric, to certain sorts of exchange, to certain reasons for action. This is true we have seen cases in which a recognition of incommensurability stops people from doing things. But it is also plausible to see incommensurability as constitutive of some valuable forms of freedom. These forms are not easily dispensable. The presence of incommensurability helps make possible certain relationships, attachments, and attitudes that would otherwise be unavailable.89
If friendship and cash were commensurable, or if a park and $100,000 were valued in the same way, we could not have certain attitudes toward friendship and toward parks. Indeed, if parks and $100,000 could be aligned along the same metric, parks would not be parks as we now understand them. If speech were valued in the same way as forks, we could not understand political freedom in the way that we now do. Incommensurability operates as an obstacle to certain sorts of behavior but it constitutes others, and makes them an option for us. For this reason, both social norms and life might insist that incommensurability of various sorts is desirable as a means of maintaining attitudes and relationships that are parts of good lives. I will return to this point below.90
E. Comparability, Transitivity, and Other Definitions
The definition I have offered has a relation to Joseph Raz's impor- tant and influential discussion of the problem.91 Raz offers a distinctive understanding of incommensurability. He says that "A and B are incommensurate if it is neither true that one is better than the other nor true that they are of equal value."92 To this definition, Raz adds a claim about the "mark" of incommensurability: "Two valuable options are incommensurable if (1) neither is better than the other, and (2) there is (or could be) another option which is better than one but is not better than the other."93
These statements point to an extremely puzzling state of affairs. How could one option be neither worse than, nor better than, nor
equal to another? Isn't this a failure of rationality? If two options are neither better nor worse than one another, how could some third op- tion be better than one but not better than the other? In beginning to answer these questions, Raz notes that sometimes value is a function of several diverse criteria. This is true, for example, with respect to judgments about the excellence of a novel. Our understanding of the criteria that make up excellence in a novel may impair efforts to pro- duce a complete ranking. It could thus be wrong to say that Dickens is better or worse than Joyce, and also wrong to say that Dickens and Joyce are (even roughly) equal in value. Any of these three possibili- ties could reasonably be thought obtuse. Dickens and Joyce are not roughly equal in value because, on one view of their merit, the choice for either one over the other could be supported by very different and quite substantial reasons.94
Some further examples may help. Smith may have no clear preference between lunch with a friend and a fifty dollar gift the one is neither better nor worse than the other. Nor are the two equal in value. At the same time, Smith would prefer a sixty dollar gift to a fifty dollar gift. But Smith has no clear preference between lunch with a friend and a sixty dollar gift the one is still neither better nor worse than the other. Or there is a political initiative that seems to Jones neither better nor worse than another: a reduction in the staff of the White House by ten percent, and a new restriction on lobbying by government employees. Jones would prefer a fifteen percent reduction in the staff of the White House to a ten percent reduction. But Jones does not think that a fifteen percent reduction in the White House staff is better or worse than a new restriction on lobbying by government employees. When incommensurability occurs, Raz claims,95 there is a failure of transitivity: A is neither better nor worse than B AI is better than A but Al is neither better nor worse than B. If it occurs, the
apparent failure of transitivity is troubling to many understandings about rational choice, but we can imagine many settings in which the failure seems to appear.96
It is right but not really responsive to say that, once the amounts change, assessments of these problems change as well. To be sure, Smith might unambiguously prefer $1000 to lunch with a friend, or the lunch to five dollars. It is true that Jones's uncertainty might dissipate if she is asked to choose between a fifty percent reduction in White House staff and a new restriction on lobbying. But these truths do not undermine the basic claim, which is vindicated if some apparent failures of transitivity can be found. To insist that such apparent failures occur, it is not necessary to say that people will not find large amounts of one good better than smaller amounts of another with which it is not commensurable.97 Below I will take up some of the ambiguities in this argument.98 Raz's formulation is related to the definition I have offered. If there were a metric along which all judgments could be aligned, transitivity would always be found. A problem of intransitivity can arise when the use of a unitary metric does violence to our considered judg- ments. Thus A might be incommensurable with B, because the two cannot be assessed along the same metric but C might be better than A, because it can be assessed along the same metric as A, without and this is the key point - being better than the differently valued B.
But the approach I am offering has some differences from Raz's formulation. Raz does not speak of metrics he addresses a much larger problem than I identify here, and his claim is, I think, much more ambitious (and hence more controversial). One can admit the failure of metrics in the sense in which I use the term while also denying the possibility of failures of transitivity.99 Although Raz insists
that incommensurability does not preclude choice,10? he identifies incommensurability with incomparability the identification is also sug- gested by the use of the word better in the statement quoted above.101 Thus Raz says that incommensurability "marks the inability of reason to guide our action."'02 For Raz, we can make and even predict choices, perhaps by reference to psychological factors, even in the midst of widespread incommensurabilities, and in the absence of reason-guided outcomes.103 Choices may have causes, and hence be predictable, without reasons.104
But there is yet another possibility: goods may be incommensurable in something very much like Raz's sense without being incomparable, in the sense that we cannot choose among them for good reasons.105 There may be incommensurability between goods A and B even though there are good (nonalgorithmic) reasons for choosing one over the other, and in this sense for thinking that one is better. Op- tions can be incommensurable in this way while still being very much subject to reasonable choice (and to evaluation and certainly to ordinal ranking). Indeed, reasonable choices among incommensurable options are the stuff not merely of law, but of everyday life. It remains to provide a description of what accounts for those choices. But we might conclude that, when incommensurability in Raz's sense occurs, reasons are likely to be available by which to choose among options. Incomparability need not be involved. 808
F. Scales and Choices
This way of understanding things is supported by Elizabeth Anderson's illuminating discussion of the problem. In Anderson's view, "[t]wo goods are incommensurable with respect to some scale if one is neither better, worse, nor equal in value to the other in the respects measured by the scale."106 Anderson says that the problem of incommensurability tends to arise when three conditions are met. First, the relevant goods meet the scale's standard in quite different
ways. Second, there are no large-scale differences in the degree to which each good meets the standard in its own way. Third, the way one good meets the standard is not categorically superior to the way the other good meets the Possible examples include artistic excellence, individual well-being, and generosity. Picasso may be neither equal to nor better or worse than Velasquez in terms of artistic excellence. If Picasso had been a little bit better than in fact he was, this could still be the case. A decision to become a lawyer in New York may be incommensurate, in terms of individual well-being, with a decision to become an artist in a small town in Colorado. A wellknown philanthropist is neither more nor less generous than someone who does innumerable small favors for his friends nor is it true that the two are equally generous.
As Anderson suggests, incommensurability always operates with respect to some scale. Whether there is commensurability depends on the particular scale that is in use. Scales are of course not metrics in the sense in which I have used that term. A metric is designed to erase qualitative differences, most notably the problem of how goods meet the metric's standard. We know that good A costs $100 and good B $500 no question of qualitative difference arises. Scales, in contrast, can exist without metrics, and there may be diverse ways to meet a scale's standard. Problems of incommensurability cannot occur when we are using a metric (dollars, yards). But such problems may well arise when we are using a scale (artistic excellence, generosity).
As Anderson also suggests, rational choice can occur among incommensurable options, not because one option has a higher abstract "value" than another, but because of expressive considerations that help us decide what option makes most sense in situations of Those expressive considerations give diverse values their point they focus attention on how it is that different goods are appropriately valued. For example, someone facing an important career choice may perceive a problem of incommensurability, but may nonetheless be able to choose rationally - that is, on the basis of reasons. For example, the agent may be committed to an ideal about what sort of person she should be. She may find that one choice damages her most impor- tant ends. She may see that her own motivations, with respect to one choice, are founded on bad reasons, such as unjustified fear. She may be able to see that one choice makes more narrative sense of her life. 09
Unlike Raz, Anderson claims that choices among incommensurables can be based on an assessment of reasons. There are many complexities in this account, and I cannot explore them here. But I think that something like it is fundamentally correct and that it also has close parallels in hard cases in law."0
We are left at this stage with an obvious question: Does the fact of choice show that options are commensurable after all? I do not think that it does, for choice can occur among incommensurable goods. We should not identify the actuality of choice with a claim of commensurability. It is odd and unnecessary to say that commensurability necessarily "lies behind" or "justifies" all rational or irrational choices.' 1 We choose whether to take an exciting job in a new city, when the move would unsettle our family we decide hard tort cases we choose between work and leisure we decide how much to spend to promote worker safety or energy conservation. These choices are based on reasons and evaluated by reference to them. Commensurability is not required for choice.
A claim of radical incommensurability would deny this possibility.' 2 On this view, choices among incommensurable options are impossible on rational grounds, or relevant goods are so radically incommensurate that there is no process by which human beings can reasonably choose among them. Reasons run out. I think that it is very rare for this form of incommensurability to occur in the intrapersonal case. People often face incommensurability - either in the sense that I have emphasized or in the Raz-Anderson sense - without being at all paralyzed about what to do, and while thinking, rightly, that their judgments are based on reasons. But the interpersonal case is different, and this point is important for law. In some contexts, people who sharply disagree do seem to be close to the unhappy state of radical incommensurability. This is so in the sense that they appear to belong to different cultures, and the difference makes it hard for them to reason together. If two people value something in entirely different ways - a religious object, an act of apparent discrimination, a form of liberty, the free market - they may be unable to talk to one an-
other. 13 Indeed, we may say that one of the marks of a genuine cultural difference is sharp or unbridgeable distinctions in kinds of valuation.
Most of the time, however, radical incommensurability is not present. Both people and societies do make choices among incommensurable goods, and they do so on the basis of reasons. Indeed, this is a principal task for practical reason, especially in law. It follows that we should not identify the existence of good reasons for action with the existence of a unitary metric. Some choices among incommensurable goods are rational, and others are not, because of the connection between any particular choice and the achievement of good lives or good societies (these are of course vague ideas, on which I will say a bit more in Part A decision to work through lunch is incommensurable with the option to have lunch with a good friend in town just for the day, but it may well be irrational, in these circumstances, to work through lunch. Economic growth is incommensurable with the reduction of race discrimination, but it may well be irrational to refuse to outlaw race discrimination even if that step involves some loss in social wealth. A resistance to these claims about rationality would be based on a highly sectarian conception of what rationality is - that is, a conception that begs the question on the commensurability issue by assuming that there cannot be rationality without commensurability.
If grounds exist for evaluating choices among incommensurable goods, it is reasonable to think that a second-order desire or goal to be a good person, to have a fair society, to hear an excellent composer - provides a framework for evaluating seemingly diverse and plural goods. If described at a low or intermediate level of abstraction, however, our higher-order goals are themselves plural and incommensura-
ble, even though there is still choice and even reasonable choice. Nevertheless, it is certainly plausible to say that, if the second-order goal operates at a high level of abstraction, we can generate criteria for private and public choice that do help in the assessment of diverse and plural goods. This is a promising but the relevant criteria cannot be fairly characterized as a metric. I will say more on these points below.
Some people may find claims about incommensurability, and distinctions among kinds of valuation, to be abstruse or of no practical use. Perhaps we are dealing here with a linguistic or rhetorical debate, one that has no consequences for law, ethics, or politics. Or perhaps it is possible to translate relevant descriptions into different terms without losing anything important.
Begin with the question whether claims of incommensurability are right as a description of how people perceive certain situations of choice. Donald Regan, for example, says that when someone refuses to specify the monetary value of friendship, "I think what such a person is most likely to mean is that friendship is more valuable than any amount of money, or in other words, that the value of friendship is incomparably greater." With respect to social disapproval of a parent's "purchasing" children, Regan thinks that "it is closer to the truth to say that we regard the value of parenthood as incomparably greater than the value of money, than to say that we regard these values as incommensurable.""18 Regan also thinks that the fact that people deliberate hard and long about choices among incommensurable values weakens the claim of incommensurability, since "[t]he decision process would necessarily be arbitrary. So what is the point?"119
Regan's challenge to incommensurability, as a description of what
people mean, what they experience, and how they really think, seems to me unsuccessful. Let us take the example of friendship. We can certainly imagine someone who thinks that the value of friendship, or the value of a particular friendship, is just greater than the value of any sum of money. But many people do not think in this way. Some people - perhaps especially desperately poor people - might be willing to sacrifice a friendship in return for a great deal of money. In such cases, friendship does not appear "more" valuable than money. In purely quantitative terms, the friendship appears "less" valuable than the sum of money involved. Yet those who accept the trade might nonetheless find it disturbing - because, I think, the friendship is not more valuable or less valuable, but differently valuable, and we do violence to the way that it is valuable if we trade it for money straight-up. Friendship involves companionship, and it is in the very nature of companionship to be beyond purchase. Recall that some incommensurabilities are freedom-producing, because they allow certain relationships and attachments that would otherwise be impossible. 20 Or take the issue of parenthood. A parent who is asked to trade a child for some sum of money might well react with outrage and shock and regard the request as insulting. This reaction is not that of someone asked to sell something very valuable at a discount - of someone asked to sell an expensive suit for a dollar. The recipient of the offer objects not because the amount offered is unconscionably low, but because the kind of valuation is grotesquely unsuitable. The experience of parenthood is inconsistent with having an evaluative attitude that would permit consideration of dollar compensation for its sacrifice. The experience of parenthood rules that alternative off limits. It is this important point of the subject that Regan's challenge misses.
I do not suggest that Regan describes a conceptually impossible attitude toward things. We could imagine someone who believed simply that friendship and parenthood were especially valuable versions of the same thing of which money is just another instance. But this view would not simply describe existing attitudes. It would call for their renovation, and in an extremely dramatic If people really valued friendship, parenthood, and money in the same way, they would be fundamentally different from what they now are. In some guises, this would be the stuff of science fiction or horror. In some
areas of life or law, the renovation may be justified, all things considered. But it would be a renovation nonetheless.
A tempting response is that the stakes here are purely linguistica matter of rhetoric, not substance. Perhaps people who disagree about kinds of valuation, and about commensurability, are just disagreeing about how to talk. Certainly recognizable emotions and sentiments underlie these disagreements. But perhaps substantive analysis can ultimately proceed in the same way however we decide these matters. Even if legal and policy arguments based on commensurability meet a good deal of verbal resistance at the outset, perhaps rational argument can overcome the resistance.
For example, economic analysis of nonmarket relations often runs into difficulty because of such initially jarring terms as "investment" in one's children, the notion that education is a way of improving "human capital," and the idea of a "marriage market."122 The terms seem to suggest that intrinsic goods are of only instrumental value. But once we think about these issues, we can see that these terms are simply a means of describing real-world phenomena, and of doing so in a way that makes complex, seemingly intractable problems more manageable.
In particular, consider the striking change in reactions to the recommendation on behalf of transferable pollution rights in environmental law.123 The government creates such rights by licensing firms to emit a certain level of pollution and then granting them the right to sell part or all of that license for a fee. Initially many people resisted the idea that one could pollute for a price - as if the idea were itself offensive to the proper kind of valuation of the environment, and as if environmental degradation should be treated as if it were incommensurable with cash.124 But now a general consensus has emerged that along all or almost all relevant dimensions - both economic and environmental - a system of economic incentives is superior to commandand-control regulation.125 There seems to have occurred a process of learning through which people are no longer so disturbed by the redescription of the environmental problem in terms that tend, perhaps, to assume commensurability and unitary kinds of valuation.
This example suggests that the assumption of commensurability
ations of the various goods at stake - higher gross national product, lower employment, cleaner air, and so forth - in stringent environmental proposals. An insistence on these points should lead to better thought about the relevant values, and it will likely lead to better outcomes as well.
Let us return to some familiar economic redescriptions of human endeavors. If someone really thought about dating and romance as participation in "a marriage market," he would be a strange creature indeed (and unlikely, perhaps, to fare especially well in the relevant practices). If someone thought that she was "selling" an idea, she would have an odd conception of intellectual life and perhaps be unable fully to participate in it, because she would be rejecting its own foundational norms. If a parent thought that, through the provision of love and education, he was simply "investing" in his children, he would have an odd and barely recognizable understanding of the pa- rental role. No one should deny what seems obvious - that people often learn at least partly because of the economic benefits of learning. But if someone really thought that learning was solely a matter of "investing in human capital," she would have a thin and even debased conception of the purpose of learning. She would be thinking of her own capacities and hopes as a sort of commodity, like a bit of silver or gold - or perhaps as a simple source of commodities, like a tractor or an oil well. It is difficult even to imagine the self-conception entailed by this view. To think and talk in these terms may have unfortunate consequences for both thought and action.128 At the same time, cerquately realized only if people refuse to contemplate certain choices or attitudes. It is in this sense that incommensurability is constitutive of our values129 and not easily dispensable.
It is sometimes said that trade-offs of the relevant sort are happen- ing "implicitly" all the time.130 People may not trade dollars for lunch
engagements with friends, but they do trade off a range of variables in deciding when and with whom to have lunch, and some of these variables are financial. Indeed, it would not be odd for a busy lawyer to cancel lunch with a friend, with a promise to buy lunch next time. People may not think that they are "investing" in their children, but they do allocate limited resources among, for example, leisure, consumer goods, vacation, and education for their offspring. But much depends on what the ambiguous word "implicitly" means. The fact that the trade-off is not made explicitly is hardly a matter of indifference. When the trade-off is made only "implicitly," it is not well-described as an ordinary trade-off at all. The actor may be showing a commitment to a certain set of judgments about how relationships and prospects should be valued, and if the trade-offs were made explicitly, that commitment would be undermined or even violated. The explicit trade is not equivalent to the implicit one the absence of explicitness maintains certain social norms. In an analogous context, Holmes wrote, "[e]ven a dog distinguishes between being stumbled over and being kicked" 131 the difference between a trip and a kick - identical in effect but conveying very different attitudes - is related to the difference between an implicit and an explicit trade. In these circumstances, it is hopelessly underdescriptive to claim that someone "implicitly" trades off (say) cash and friendship in making lunch decisions, even though this way of seeing things might be quite helpful for predictive purposes.
Economic or utilitarian descriptions of human behavior are unlikely by themselves to alter social norms or law in any significant way.132 But social norms are in a constant process of evaluation and flux, and the description of kinds of valuation is one method by which norms are created and altered. The making of law reflects this process of description and valuation law can have effects on kinds of valuation as Indeed, many of the sharpest disputes in law relate to the appropriate kinds of valuation to bring to bear on disputed problems. Here a pervasive question is what sorts of valuations the law ought to encourage or extinguish.
If kinds of valuation matter to human life, judgments about such kinds will matter a great deal to law as well. And, in many areas of law, the question of commensurability occupies a surprisingly important place.
The diverse kinds of valuation do not map neatly onto legal categories. We cannot say that, because people value different events in different ways, it follows that law should have a particular content. Nor can we draw lessons for law from the bare fact of incommensurability in any of the senses discussed here.134 This is so for several reasons.
First, we need an account of which kinds of valuation are appropriate in order to make recommendations for law.135 We are not and should not be agnostics or skeptics about appropriate kinds of valuation they can be evaluated on the basis of reasons.136 Nor should we be simple conventionalists, thinking that, because people value a certain thing in a certain way, the law ought to do so as well. Of course democracy has its claims but there may be good reason to challenge any particular popularly endorsed judgment on kinds of valuation. Indeed, some aspects of constitutional law represent an effort to discipline democratic discussion by limiting possible kinds of valuation, on the ground that they are too sectarian or inconsistent with principles of civic equality.137 When there are no constitutional barriers, the democratic process is formally unconstrained, but an important part of democratic debate consists of challenges to kinds of valuation that prevail among the democratic majority.
Any judgments about appropriate kinds of valuation are of course a complex matter. This is so not least because, in a heterogeneous society, the state ought to allow a wide range of diverse valuations. The regulation of valuations can be a stifling matter.138 At least as a
presumption, the state ought to allow people to value in the way that they see best. These considerations, however, do not imply that the state should remain agnostic about proper kinds of valuation. Incommensurabilities - even of the form that block certain reasons for action - are not merely freedom-reducing, but constitutive of certain sorts of freedom, for they make possible certain valuable relationships and commitments. Moreover, a state will have a hard time if it seeks to be entirely neutral about valuations. Global neutrality is impossible.139 The state has to make decisions about how to allocate rights and entitlements it has to decide what can be traded on markets and what will be subject to politics, and these decisions inevitably will take some sort of stand on appropriate valuations.
Second, a judgment about the appropriate kind of valuation, even if it can be reached and persuasively defended, need not entail a particular conclusion for law. For example, it might be shown that prostitu- tion entails an improper valuation of human sexuality, but this need not mean that prostitution should be outlawed. To justify outlawing prostitution, we must make an additional set of arguments about both the likely effectiveness of the ban and the principle that supports use of the coercive power of the state. Or we might think that the best human life involves a certain way of valuing the environment, without thereby rejecting, for example, tradable emissions permits as a regula- tory tool. Perhaps tradable permits do not affect valuations of the environment perhaps any such effects are minimal and well justified by the various gains. Or we might believe that animals deserve consideration and therefore ought not to be eaten, but also believe that the law should not require vegetarianism. State-compelled vegetarianism might well be ineffectual and inconsistent with individual liberty, rightly conceived. These examples show that any general claim about the right kind of valuation needs a great deal of supplementation to result in concrete recommendations for law and policy. There are also recurring questions about the feasibility of various legal strategies.
More generally, we can defend one kind of valuation for law and government and other kinds for family, church, and civil society. The law might, for example, insist on calculating the value of human life through conventional economic measures. The calculation might be acceptable if there is an "acoustic separation"'40 between legal meas-
ures and private life. At least if the measures do not affect prevailing kinds of valuation and can operate autonomously in their own sphere, the law may be acceptable even if it does not reflect an appropriate kind of valuation for other contexts.
Third, the legal system has crude remedial tools. Usually it must use monetary remedies. In view of this limitation, the fact that these remedies are not commensurable with some harms is often merely an interesting theoretical point. When someone has lost an arm, or when a river has been polluted, the legal system has to work with money. The tools of the legal system lack sufficient refinement fully to take account of diverse kinds of valuation. What can be said about per- sonal valuations cannot be said about legal institutions. It may follow that public policy ought to operate on the assumption of commensurability even if human beings should not or it may follow that the legal system often must put problems of incommensurability to one side, leaving those problems for ethics rather than for law.
These disclaimers are important. Nonetheless, the fact of incommensurability, and the existence of diverse kinds of valuation, do help illuminate a wide range of disputes about the substance of law, about legal institutions, and about legal reasoning. In the next section, I offer several examples of pertinent legal debates. My goal is emphati- cally not to resolve these debates. To do this I would have to say a great deal more than I will be able to do here. I intend only to suggest that an understanding of questions of commensurability and appropriate kinds of valuation helps explain the nature of these debates.
B. The Expressive Function of Law
A unifying theme for the discussion is the expressive function of law. When evaluating a legal rule, we might ask whether the rule expresses an appropriate valuation of an event, person, group, or practice. The point matters for two reasons. The first and most important is based on a prediction about the facts: an incorrect valuation may influence social norms and push them in the wrong direction. For example, if the law says that the act of murder can or cannot be met with the death penalty, social norms may be influenced. If the law 820
modity, the social kind of valuation may be adversely affected. If the law mandates recycling, subsidizes national service, or requires mandatory pro bono work, it may have healthy effects on social valuations of the relevant activities. It is appropriate to evaluate the law on this ground.142
We can go further. Some people seem to think that it is possible to assess law solely on the basis of consequences - that an open-ended inquiry into consequences is a feasible way of evaluating legal rules. But this is not actually possible. The effects of any legal rule can be described in an infinite number of ways. Any particular characterization or accounting of consequences will rest not on some specification of the brute facts instead it will be mediated by a set of (often tacit) norms determining how to describe or conceive of consequences. Part of the expressive function of law consists in the identification of what consequences count and how they should be described. Because any conception of consequences is interpretive and thus evaluative in character, simple consequentialism is not a feasible project for law.
The point emerges from an important development in the law of standing. In 1970, the Supreme Court decided that people would have standing to challenge government action if they could show an "injury in fact" a legal interest was not The Court's goal was to ensure that standing decisions would rest solely on facts, without an inquiry into values or law. It is, however, quite impossible to decide whether there is "injury in fact" without values or law.144 Anyone who initiates a lawsuit believes that he is injured the question is which consequences or injuries count and how they are to be characterized. Jones likes classical music, and he is unhappy about the Federal Communication Commission's decision to award a license to a rock music station on 104.3 FM. Is his injury the actual unavailability of classical music in the area? His diminished opportunity to hear classical music? The unavailability of classical music on 104.3 FM? Offense at the presence of rock music on the airwaves? To answer such questions, we cannot look only at consequences or facts. We have to make some sort of judgment about which consequences count and how to describe them.
The point can be generalized far beyond the law of standing. Any
terrorist, even if the consequence of the refusal is that many more peo- ple will be killed. Or a pacifist might refuse to take a job in a munitions factory, even if the refusal will have no salutary effects.
Our responses to these cases are not adequately captured in purely consequentialist Now it is possible that, for example, the refusal to kill an innocent person is consequentially justified on balance, for people who refuse to commit bad acts may cultivate attitudes that lead to value-maximizing But this is a complex matter. My point is only that consequentialist accounts do not fully describe our evaluative attitudes toward such acts.
Moreover, the expression of the appropriate evaluative attitude should be understood as a human good, constitutive of desirable characteristics. By making certain choices and not others, people express various conceptions both of themselves and of others. This is an independently important matter. We should agree on this point even if we also believe that consequences count (mediated as they are by expressive norms) and that people ought not to be fanatical.
There is a rough analog at the social and legal level.150 A society might identify the kind of valuation to which it is committed and insist on that kind, even if the consequences of the insistence are obscure or unknown. A society might, for example, insist on an antidiscrimination law for expressive reasons even if it does not know whether the law actually helps members of minority groups. A society might protect endangered species partly because it believes that the protection makes best sense of its self-understanding, by expressing an appropri- ate valuation of what it means for one species to eliminate another. A society might endorse or reject capital punishment because it wants to express a certain understanding of the appropriate course of action after one person has taken the life of another.
The point bears on the cultural role of adjudication and especially of Supreme Court decisions. The empirical effects of those decisions are highly disputed.151 When the Supreme Court says that capital punishment is unconstitutional, that segregation is unlawful, that certain restrictions on hate speech violate the First Amendment, or that students cannot be asked to pray in school, the real-world consequences may be much smaller than we think. But the close attention paid to the Court's pronouncements may well be connected with their expressive or symbolic character.'52 When the Court makes a decision, it is often taken to be speaking on behalf of the nation's basic principles and commitments. This is a matter of importance quite apart from consequences, conventionally understood. It is customary and helpful to point to the Court's educative effect.'53 But perhaps its expressive effect, or its expressive character, better captures what is often at stake.
I do not claim that the expressive effects of law, thus understood, are decisive or that they cannot be countered by a demonstration of more conventional bad consequences. Indeed, I think that this understanding of the expressive function, unaccompanied by educative effects, ought to play little role in deciding on the content of law. There might insist on a sort of acoustic separation between the domain of law and other spheres, hoping and believing that the kind of valuation appropriate to government will not affect the generally prevailing kind. If OSHA engages in cost-benefit analysis, surely people will not begin to think of their spouses as commodities. But I do suggest that the expressive function is a part of political and legal debate. Without understanding the expressive function of law, we will have a hard time in getting an adequate handle on public views with respect to, for example, civil rights, prostitution, the environment, endangered species, capital punishment, and abortion.
In this Part, I discuss a number of areas of law in which kinds of valuation are at stake. In some of these areas, issues of commensurability also move to the fore. Of course there are important differences
among these areas, each of which raises distinctive issues of its own. Some of the issues are connected to problems of individual or social choices amidst scarcity others are not. But I believe that it is impossible to obtain a full understanding of these areas of law without reference to ideas of this general sort. In this sense, these very diverse areas share a common subject. They are united by the presence of impor- tant questions about appropriate kinds of valuation and about commensurability.
A. Social Differentiation
A liberal society allows a high degree of social differentiation.'54 It includes the political sphere, the family, markets, intermediate organiMichael Walzer's influential book155 offers an instructive discussion of these different "spheres." It would be especially valuable to be able to understand the social function or purpose of this sort of differentiation. Why might it be a good thing to carve life up in this way? And what exactly is the role of law in this endeavor?
The liberal commitment to social differentiation can be understood as an effort to make appropriate spaces for different kinds of valuaWithout accepting naive conceptions of the public-private distinction, we can see the family as the characteristic liberal sphere for the expression of love. At its best, politics embodies the forms of respect entailed by processes of reason-giving.'57 In many intermediate organizations, people express affection and admiration. In religious organizations, the prevailing kind of valuation is usually one of worship and reverence. The market is typically the sphere for use. Things bought and sold on markets are typically valued in the way associated with pure commodities, although it is important and also true that many things sold on markets - music, vacations in beautiful places, art, childcare - are valued for reasons other than simple use. Law plays an important and often overlooked role in the construction and maintenance of these various spheres, which are anything but
natural. We know far too little to say that, in the state of nature, there is any such division (though there may well be antecedents158). Markets are of course a function of the law of property, contract, and tort, without which voluntary agreements would not be It is law that decides what can be traded on markets, and how trades can occur. Undoubtedly families of various sorts would arise in the state of nature, but the particular families we have are emphatically a function of law. The law helps to create an independent familial sphere it also determines who may be entitled to its protections and
To some extent, the state also insulates the public sphere from civil society, through, for example, the rule of one person, one vote161 and limitations on expenditures on campaigns.162 Intermediate organiza- tions, like religious groups and labor unions, also receive various protections, insulations, and disabilities by laws designed to recognize independent social spheres.163 The creation of diverse social spheres, understood as a mechanism for allowing diverse kinds of valuation, is also an important social good, providing a form of liberty that is indispensable in modern society.164
It would be foolish to idealize current practices. Institutional prac- tice often deviates from institutional aspiration. Politics is often a realm for use it has important marketlike features. It is hardly a simple process of exchanging reasons. The family is not only a place for the expression of love. Women and children have often been used without their consent, sometimes like commodities. People who believe in different kinds of valuation do not deny the gap between current practice and current aspiration. Much social criticism consists of an insistence on that gap, and of a claim for reform in the interest of producing conformity to the aspiration.
Moreover, it is possible to conceive of prevailing institutions in quite different ways. Some familiar social criticism consists of a claim that an existing sphere of social differentiation embodies an inadequate kind of valuation. Thus, for example, the family has often been a place for hierarchy and deference, and it is sometimes suggested that processes of mutual respect and reason-giving should displace this unjust kind of valuation.165 The political process has often been conceived as appropriately a realm of reason-giving the characteristic American attack on hierarchy and privilege is an attempt to replace a system of authority with a system of reasons.166 Some people think that the attack has not gone far enough and that if reason-giving is to prevail, legal changes are needed to ensure against (for example) the corrosive effects on democratic deliberation of disparities in Others argue that bonds of affection and even love ought to replace or supplement the kinds of reason-giving that are characteristic of modOften, of course, market thinking is said to be at least a descriptively and perhaps a normatively superior alternative to current kinds of valuation. Thus it is sometimes suggested that family life, sexual choice, and markets ought all to be conceived as systems of exchange and use.169 Some especially ambitious forms of social criticism involve an effort to claim that one kind of valuation - use, respect, love, worship ought to be the universal one.170 Most modestly, it is sometimes suggested that things would be better if the family were made more marketlike, or if the market were made more familylike.'71
These debates show that many claims for social reform are really arguments for revision of the kinds of valuation prevailing in different social institutions. In some forms, these claims point to the constitutive role of law, urging that existing arrangements are hardly natural, that they could not exist without certain legal choices, and that revi-
sions in law would make sense from the standpoint of justice or some other value. Of course a traditional liberal view is that widely diverse kinds of valuation are an important social good.'72
B. Religion, Civic Equality, and Political Liberalism
Our system is one of liberal As such, it is committed to a principle of political equality and to a certain view about the relationship between political life and religious conviction. We can make some progress on these abstractions by observing that a liberal republic attempts to exclude certain kinds of valuation from public life. Those kinds of valuation may be too sectarian, or they may be inconsistent with the premise of political equality. A liberal republic thus bans particular "inputs" into politics either because they express a kind of valuation that is suited only to private life, or because they deny political equality, a commitment that entails certain evaluative attitudes toward fellow citizens. What I want to emphasize is that we can get a distinctive purchase on certain constitutional issues in this light.
Under the Constitution, the Establishment Clause'74 is the key example of the ban on certain kinds of valuation. The Constitution rules out valuations that assume certain conceptions of what is sacred, at least those that invoke religious commitments. For example, a law making Easter a national holiday may not rest on the ground that it reflects the sanctity of Jesus Christ. 75 The Establishment Clause generally rules sectarian justifications for statutes out of bounds, 76 even if other, neutral factors could support the same laws.'77 Political liberalism is constituted in part through the idea that certain kinds of valuation are too contentious to be a legitimate part of public life, even if they are a fully legitimate part of private citizenship.'78
A liberal republic also excludes certain kinds of valuation of human beings as inconsistent with constitutionally prescribed norms of political equality. I have referred to the prohibition on "titles of
ing media in the interest of promoting democratic In at least two ways, issues of appropriate kinds of valuation and of commensurability underlie these debates. The first issue is whether to treat speech as an ordinary commodity, valued in the same way as other commodities. The second issue is whether free speech values are unitary or instead plural and diverse.
Substantial government deregulation of the airwaves has spurred much of the recent debate concerning the first issue.188 Some people think that, in terms of actual programming, deregulation has promoted a sort of accelerating race to the bottom, rather than furthering the democratic goals of attention to public issues and diversity of view.'89 The result has been a split between the democratic conception of free speech and the belief in satisfying consumption choices. If we satisfy consumer desires, we may fail to promote democratic goals of intelligent and informed political participation.'90
In these circumstances, many of the recent challenges to deregulated markets in expression reject the notion that speech should be valued in the same way or for the same purposes as ordinary consumer products. This claim suggests that a system of free markets is not necessarily compatible with a well-functioning system of free expression. These are two very different things. If a free speech market promotes democratic goals, it is not because it is a conceptual truth, but because the forces of supply and demand work out that way.191 It may well turn out that market forces disserve democratic ideals by deterring substantive coverage of public issues and sufficient diversity of view. If so, democratic correctives may promote the purposes of the free speech guarantee.
Those who think of speech as a commodity, to be valued in the same way as other things that people desire, are often unable to understand the complaints of people who urge a democratic conception. This is because they have a distinctive conception of what speech is
one that makes it hard to come to terms with the different conception of the democrats. Thus the former chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission, Mark Fowler, said that "television is just another appliance. It's a toaster with pictures."192 This is a conspicuous statement of the market conception of free speech, and it is jarring because it reveals an unusually stark view of how to value the products of the broadcast media.
The most basic objection to this claim is that it shows an improper kind (not necessarily level) of valuation of some forms of speech. If we value speech either as an intrinsic good or because it is instrumental to a well-functioning deliberative process, we will value it in a quite different way from toasters. The assessment of legal policy will change accordingly. Of course it remains possible that we would conclude that, because of the dangers of content-based regulation of the speech market, deregulation is the right legal strategy, all things considered. But this complex institutional argument - about the role of the First Amendment in a second-best world - strikingly differs from that offered by Chairman Fowler.
With respect to the second issue, it seems clear that free speech values are plural and diverse rather than Much inventive and instructive work has attempted to identify a single value animating the protection of free speech, like democracy, self-realization, autonomy, or consumer satisfaction.194 But it would be most surprising if free speech were connected with any single This is true for most constitutional rights, which serve a range of purposes. The pro- tection of property rights, for example, helps to promote economic prosperity by creating appropriate incentives for productive activity. But it also safeguards individual security an important noneconomic value - and, by limiting government discretion over personal holdings, it serves democratic goals as well.196 The problem with unitary or monistic theories of constitutional value is that they are insufficiently differentiated.
It would be especially obtuse to suggest that the free speech principle serves only political values. A system of free communication
yields a wide variety of diverse social Significant autonomy interests, quite independent of democracy, help justify the protection of free speech.198 There is also an important connection between free speech and individual self-development. The opportunity to create art or literature, like the opportunity to read the products of other minds, is part of the development of human capacities. A vigorous free speech principle also helps secure scientific progress. Finally, free communication is indispensable to economic development.199 A wellfunctioning system of free expression should be alert to the wide range of values at stake, and to the qualitative distinctions among those values.
An understanding of diverse values will not lead to a simple set of judgments about the meaning of the First Amendment. But it should help inform the constitutional inquiry. Many debates in the First Amendment area are about different kinds of valuation of speech and about the relationship of those kinds to constitutional inquiry.200
The point applies to most constitutional rights. As simply one other example, consider the debate over whether the Supreme Court should protect "fundamental rights" under the Due Process Clause. In an influential if extreme formulation, Judge Bork asks how the Court can protect the right to sexual privacy if it does not protect the right to pollute. On Bork's view, both rights amount to "gratifications," and there is no essential difference between them.201 A less extreme version of this view is the concern whether the Court can consistently protect sexual privacy without protecting property inter- ests who is to say that the former is more important than the latter?202
We might be able to handle this question better if we insist on qualitative rather than merely quantitative differences among rights. It is not necessarily true that someone will value sexual privacy more than continued employment for longer hours at better wages, but it is possible to have a distinct concern about government regulation of the former, and it may be because of the way that sexual privacy is valued
that constitutional protection is appropriate.203 Once claims for constitutional protection are not aligned along a single scale and assessed in purely quantitative terms, it becomes easier to make progress in thinking about fundamental rights.
This general understanding may cast light on some familiar and somewhat mysterious notions in legal and social theory.204 Consider, for example, Dworkin's account of rights as "trumps,"205 or Rawls's claim that, under the appropriate theory of justice, the principle calling for equal basic liberty is lexically prior to better economic
Much might be said about these complex ideas. It is possible to think that, when we treat rights as trumps, we mean simply that rights are very highly valued and that they may not be violated without extremely strong justifications.207 Because of the high premium we place on free speech, or because of our distrust of ad hoc judgments, we ban case-by-case trade-offs. On this view, there is no issue of incommensurability. Or we might think that when A is lexically prior to B, it is simply because we place an especially high premium on A. It would indeed seem fanatical to suggest that any right, to qualify as such, must be respected regardless of the consequences.
But perhaps it is inadequate to formulate these issues in purely quantitative terms. If we treat rights as "trumps," we may be taken to
be saying not that they are infinitely or even extraordinarily valuable when viewed solely in terms of aggregate levels, but that they are valued in a distinctive way - a way quite different from, and qualitatively higher than, the way we value the competing interests. Because of the distinctive way that they are valued, it is necessary that the competing interests be (a) of a certain qualitative sort and (b) extraordinary in amount or level, in order to count as reasons for
Similarly, in speaking of the lexical priority of equal liberty, we may mean that a just society values this interest in a way that precludes its violation for social and economic advantages. The lexical priority of liberty thus represents an effort to restate Kantian ideals about the priority of equal dignity and respect.209 We can imagine cases in which this judgment could be fanatical.210 But it seems clear that, in some cases, a belief in lexical priority may well reflect claims about incommensurability. We might treat equal liberty as a reflection of the foundational commitment to equal dignity and respect, and believe that we do violence to the way we value that commitment if we allow it to be compromised for the sake of greater social and economic advantages. On this view, the lexical priority of equal liberty is structurally akin to the refusal to allow a child to be traded for cash, or a promise to be breached as a result of mildly changed circumstances. It reflects a judgment that the prevalent kind of valuation forbids compromising the good for certain reasons, even though those reasons are legitimate bases for action in other contexts.
D. Environmental Protection
Most positive theories of government regulation assess environmental issues211 by reference to people's "preferences" for environmental quality viewed abstractly, through a unitary scale, along the same metric that of utility or of willingness to pay.212 But there are some apparent anomalies in individual behavior here. In particular, ordinary people appear to resist the use of a unitary scale and the
claim of commensurability. Perhaps the discussion thus far can help make sense of some of the most puzzling phenomena relating to the public's environmental judgments. Through this route we may be able to understand some features of the apparent demand for environmental regulation, even if we ultimately conclude that the demand often involves irrationality. Consider a few examples.
(a) Some people feel extremely insulted when asked how much they would accept (WTA) for a specified level of environmental deterioration, treating the question as outrageous or a form of bribery, rather as if they had been asked to sell a child or a part of their body. Studies using WTA questions consistently receive a large number of protest answers, such as "I refuse to sell" or "I want an extremely large or infinite amount of compensation for agreeing to this" such studies frequently experience protest rates of fifty percent or more.213
(b) Some people say that environmental goods have infinite value or that the effort to achieve a clean environment should not be "traded off" against other important values. In opinion polls, people sometimes say that we should achieve a clean environment "regardless of cost." In 1992, eighty percent of respondents agreed with this statement, up from sixty-nine percent the year before.214
(c) Some apparently popular statutes reflect a sort of environmental absolutism. The Endangered Species Act215 forbids balancing except in the rarest of circumstances.216 To the same effect, the Delaney Clause217 forbids any entry of carcinogenic substances onto the market, banning trade-offs of any sort.218
(d) There are extraordinary disparities in federal expenditures for each life saved.219 Some environmental programs prevent risks at enormous cost the government is willing to spend relatively little to stop other risks. All current efforts to produce uniformity in expendi-
tures - understood, for example, as equivalent amounts of dollar expenditures for each statistical life saved - have failed.
Such phenomena may in the end reflect irrationality, confusion, poor framing of relevant questions, interest-group power, or sheer chance. But it would be useful to explore other possible explanations. When people are thinking in these various ways, exactly what are they doing?
We might hypothesize that social valuation of environmental goods comes partly from an insistence that diverse social goods should not be assessed according to the same metric, and that those goods ought to be valued in different ways. With this hypothesis, some apparent anomalies dissolve or become more readily explicable. Some people, for example, insistently rebel against the idea that we should see all of the following, environmentally related consequences as "costs": unemployment, higher prices, greater poverty, dirtier air, more cancer, respiratory problems, the loss of species. If we understand all these things as "costs," to be assessed via the same metric, we will disable ourselves from making important distinctions. It might be hypothesized that when people refuse to trade off environmental quality and other goods, they are making a claim about the diversity of goods and incommensurability. They are claiming that one set of goods is superior to another not in the sense that it is infinitely valuable, but in the sense that it stands higher in a hierarchy of public val-
an acontextual one or a global judgment about valuation or optimization, but instead highly dependent on and geared only to the particular setting in which the choice is made. When a worker accepts a risky job for cash, it may mischaracterize his choice to say that he "really" thinks that the risk is equivalent to that amount of cash - if the word "really" is intended to capture an abstract, acontextual judgment. In- stead he has simply taken this job in preference to others among a specific range of opportunities, and this decision, in its context, means nothing more general.227
Through this route, we might help come to terms with phenomena (a) through (d) above.228 For example, the risk charts might reflect qualitative distinctions among different sorts of hazards. People might be interested not only in cost for each life saved, but also in whether the risk was assumed knowingly and voluntarily, whether the exposing entity knows the facts, whether the underlying activity produces valuable goods, whether the hazard is common, whether the exposure is essential, whether the risk is encountered occupationally or elsewhere, and whether the people subjected to risk were able to participate in relevant decisions.229 They might also be interested in the nature of the risk, thinking, for example, that certain deaths are worse than others. Through this route, we might well discover that people's valu- ations of different risks will vary a good deal with context. Hence the varying valuations will reflect not only irrationality or interest-group pressure, but also diverse judgments about diverse risks.
I do not claim that this approach fully justifies the current disparities. In view of their obvious irrationality, that conclusion would be extravagant.230 But it may well be rational to allow widely varying
orders calling for the application of CBA to all regulatory decisions.235 These orders were withdrawn by President Clinton and replaced by a new executive order, which also places a high premium on cost-benefit
There is of course much to be said in favor of CBA. Federal regulation is notoriously and pervasively chaotic and irrational.237 Who could object to the idea that we should systematize costs and benefits and compare them? The question seems especially powerful when combined with the plausible claim that some opponents of CBA are confused about their real objection. In fact, it is sometimes said,238 the opponents' real complaint is that some of the relevant variables have been insufficiently valued. Would it not be a sufficient response to say to the critics of this form of analysis that perhaps we should place a higher premium on, for example, human health, or the environment, and then proceed with CBA?
It would be difficult to challenge the view that law and policy should be assessed on the basis of an inquiry into the advantages and disadvantages of different courses of action, and CBA often appears to be a way of systematizing that sort of approach. But at least for some purposes, I do not think this response would be sufficient. Nor is it entirely adequate to say, as critics of CBA typically do, that this sort of approach fails to address distributional issues or is biased against
The real problem with any form of conventional CBA is that it is obtuse. CBA is obtuse because it tries to measure diverse social goods along the same metric.240 Suppose, for example, that we are told that the "cost" of a certain occupational safety regulation is $1 million, and that the "benefit" is $1.2 million. To make a sensible evaluation, we need to know a great deal more. To what do these numbers refer? Do they include greater unemployment, higher inflation, and the scaledback production of important goods? Do they mean more poverty? At least in principle, it would be much better to have a highly disag-
gregated system for assessing the qualitatively different effects of regulatory impositions. People should be allowed to see those diverse effects for themselves and to make judgments based on an understanding of the qualitative differences. If all of the relevant goods are aligned along a single metric, they become less visible, or perhaps invisible. Through considerations of this sort, we might be able to make some progress toward assessment of the Reagan and Clinton administrations' executive orders on regulation. Instead of conventional costbenefit analysis, what is necessary is a full accounting of the various social consequences of regulation. Those consequences should be described in a way that allows a detailed view of what the costs and benefits specifically are. Once greater specificity is added, we will not be thinking in terms of simple costs and benefits at all. President Clinton's order241 makes some modest steps in this direction, but the steps are erratic and unconnected with any clear theory of how to assess regulation.242
The best response to this claim is pragmatic and institutional. It would be that at least for law and public policy, it makes sense to act as if diverse goods were commensurable, because this way of proceed- ing makes decisions tractable where they would otherwise be ad hoc, and because ad hoc decisions lead to a systematic misallocation of resources and a perverse system of priorities. CBA may offer a less than full description of what is really at stake, but perhaps it counteracts the forms of inconsistency and ultimate irrationality that result in the public sector if we proceed without quantitative help.
This is a plausible defense of CBA in the real world. Whether it is right depends on pragmatic judgments that cannot be resolved in the
abstract. My point is that if goods are diverse and valued in different ways, there will be considerable crudeness in this approach to regulation. Much will be lost even if much is also gained. We should therefore have a presumption in favor of a much more disaggregated accounting of the effects of regulation, one that exposes to public view the full set of effects.
F. Specific Performance, Damages, Private Law Remedies: Another
View of the Cathedral
The legal system usually insists on an award of damages for the infliction of harm a damages award appears to reflect a judgment in favor of commensurability. But sometimes damages are insufficient. We can approach a large subject - the relationship between compensation and commensurability243 - by examining a pervasive issue in the law of contract: whether to award a damages remedy or instead to require specific performance.244 From an exploration of this issue, we may be able to offer a few tentative generalizations.
It is typically said that specific performance will be awarded when damages are "inadequate." But what could this possibly mean? Suppose that Jones has contracted to buy a painting, and that the seller defaults on the agreement. It is far from clear why a court should order the seller to hand over the painting, rather than to pay damages to Jones. If the damages seem inadequate, we might think that they have been set too low, and that the right solution is simply to require the seller to pay more. Surely there is some level at which the court will set the proper amount. Why, then, is specific performance ever available?
A conventional answer is that damages remedies are inadequate when the good at issue is unique.245 But the notion of uniqueness is itself a puzzle. At least for economists, the term points at most to "questions of degree."246 All goods have substitutes of some sort this is part of the usual understanding of choice amidst scarcity. In explaining the notion of uniqueness, some people have stressed that a damages remedy might well be inaccurate for certain goods. Subjective value is peculiarly hard to ascertain in some cases, and the goods may involve high search costs that judges cannot easily determine.
The subjective value of Jones's painting is nearly impossible to know and may well substantially exceed the market value, if a market exists. The particular costs incurred by Jones in finding that particular painting are hard to establish. In these circumstances, the existence of a specific performance remedy can be seen as a natural response to information costs faced by the legal system in ascertaining the appropriate damages remedy.
We might conclude that, when it is especially expensive to determine damages, courts will order specific performance. In a brief but notable description of the doctrine, Judge Posner says that the doctrine represents an exception to the usual damages decree for cases in which "damages are difficult to compute because of a lack of good market substitutes for the performance of the contract breaker."247 This is a notable description because it suggests that behind the specific performance remedy lies the simple problem of cost of computation.
There is undoubtedly a good deal of truth to this but another factor may be at work. The specific performance remedy can be understood to stem from a resistance to commensurability. Specific performance must be awarded because the good in question is not commensurable with cash. This is not to say that it is more valuable than cash. Indeed, it is less valuable, often, than a great deal of cash. The claim is instead that the good is valued in a way that is inconsistent with cash valuation. What the plaintiff wants, and what she is entitled to get, is a good that she values in the way that she values the object for which she has contracted. A good that she values "equally," in market terms, is not a perfect substitute.248 Hence one would expect the specific performance remedy to reflect a stand in favor of diverse kinds of valuation.
There is no simple way to test this hypothesis against its economic competitor. The two would suggest parallel results. But both the rhetoric and the outcomes of some of the cases suggest that specific performance is awarded at least in part because cash does not reflect the way in which the promisee values the good in question.249
This point suggests the need to supplement Guido Calabresi and Douglas Melamed's well-known discussion of the choice between liability and property rules.250 In their terminology, a right is protected by a liability rule if it can be taken upon a payment of compensation. A right is protected by a property rule if it can be taken only through voluntary exchange, and if market compensation is therefore an inadequate justification for the taking. Calabresi and Melamed's important discussion rightly emphasizes the relevance of transactions costs, including information costs, to the choice between the two methods of legal But this account provides only part of the picture. As the discussion above suggests, property rules are also appropriate when the relevant right or good is valued in a different way from money. In such cases, courts hesitate to use liability rules, not only because courts doubt their ability to calculate a proper cost for the forgone good, but also because a dollar amount will reflect the wrong kind of valuation of the good at issue. The litigant is entitled to the good and its existing kind of valuation, rather than to a substitute valued in a different way, even if in some aggregative sense "equally."252
The point bears on damage remedies generally, most obviously for emotional distress or pain and suffering.253 As Margaret Jane Radin
has argued, we might think of financial compensation not as commensurable with many injuries at issue in tort law, and thus not as a means of truly restoring the status quo ante, but less ambitiously as an effort to establish and recognize that a wrong has been done and to deter wrongdoing while ensuring that some redress has been paid. Even if a legal system can do no better, that redress does not fully rectify the wrong, because monetary sums are not commensurable with the relevant injury.254
The same ideas underlie an important debate in environmental law, having to do with the appropriate measure of damages for injury to natural resources. The "restoration cost" for, say, a portion of the Alaska seashore may diverge from its "use value," understood as aggregated private willingness to purchase the area in question. Through an important regulation, the Department of the Interior indicated its preference for use value if it was lower than restoration cost.255 The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit invalidated the regulation on the theory that Congress had expressed a preference for restoration.256 The decision of the court reflects an understanding that those who injure natural resources should be required to restore the status quo ante, not because it is more valuable, but because the public is entitled to have a good that it values in the way that it values natural resources, rather than the so-called cash
G. Feminism in Law An understanding of issues of commensurability, and of diverse kinds of valuation, should help explain a number of claims by and debates among feminists, both inside law and elsewhere. Some of these claims and debates have been inadequately understood in the legal culture, in part because of the importance of kinds of valuation258 and because of the infrequency with which such kinds are understood to be part of legal theory and practice.
To offer a brief summary: In a statement that has now been frequently quoted (by, among others, MacKinnon herself259), Richard Rorty takes Catharine MacKinnon to have claimed that "being a woman is not yet a way of being a human being."260 What does this mean? It may well mean that women are often not valued in the way that a human being is entitled to be valued. More concretely, we might understand some feminist thought to be insisting that, as human beings, women are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect,26' and that frequently they are not so treated. Instead women are treated with affection or love, or, much worse, as objects for the use and control of others.
Consider in this regard a frequent response - offered famously by former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, but also by an astonishing number of other people - to claims of sex discrimination or even sexual assault: "I love women."262 It is interesting to think about the nature of this response and the reason that it is inadequate. It is tempting, but not sufficient, to say that such responses are insincere or false. Instead the response connotes a high level of valuation or a sort of intense and real appreciation. But the response is obtuse when the
should be taken to argue that an improper kind of valuation has pervaded norms and law relating to women, and that changes are required that would embody a different kind.
H. Blocked Exchanges
An understanding of diverse kinds of valuation helps explain why liberal regimes generally respect voluntary agreements. If people value things in different ways, the state should allow them to sort things out as they choose. If values were commensurable, perhaps we could seek to block certain voluntary exchanges simply because we had better information about relevant costs and benefits than the parties themselves. But, in the face of diverse kinds of valuation, it is best to permit people to value as they like.267
But even a system that generally respects freedom of contract may block exchanges on several grounds. Typically such grounds involve some form of market failure: a party may lack relevant information, a collective action problem may exist, third parties may be affected, a party may be myopic. But an additional and distinct reason is that some exchanges involve and encourage improper kinds of valuation.
I think that more common arguments stressing distributive considerations or unequal bargaining power often depend, upon reflection, on an unarticulated claim about inappropriate valuation. The claim is that to allow purchase and sale of a good will mean that the good will be wrongly valued in a qualitative sense.268 Consider, for example, the right to vote. Vote trading is objectionable in part because it would allow inappropriate concentration of political power in the hands of a few. The prohibition therefore overcomes a collective action prob- lem.269 But perhaps the ban on vote trading also stems from a concern about kinds of valuation. If votes were freely tradable, we would have a different conception of what voting is for about the values that it embodies - and this changed conception would have corrosive effects on politics.
Some reactions to Judge Posner's argument on behalf of a form of "baby selling" stem from a similar concern.270 Judge Posner contends that a market for babies would serve most of the relevant policies bet- ter than does the current system. In some ways his argument is per- suasive. Certainly the desire of infertile couples for children would be better satisfied through a market system. But part of the objection to free markets in babies is not quite engaged by Judge Posner. Instead the objection is that a system of purchase and sale would value children in the wrong way. This system would treat human beings as commodities, a view that is itself wrong, and a practice with possible harmful consequences for social valuation in general. This is at most a summary of a complex argument, based partly on uncertain empirical judgments, and it is hardly by itself decisive. But we cannot get an adequate grasp on the problem without seeing this concern.
Or consider a possible application of the widely held view that market incentives are preferable to command-and-control regulation. Might it not be preferable, for example, to allocate tradable racial discrimination rights, so that discriminators, or people who refuse to act affirmatively, can purchase rights from people who do not discriminate or who engage in affirmative action?271 Suppose it could be shown that an approach of this sort would be more efficient than the approach in the current civil rights laws, and also that it would produce equal or better outcomes in terms of aggregate hiring of minority group members. Even if this were so, it might be thought unacceptable to permit employers to discriminate for a fee, because the way that we do or should value nondiscrimination is inconsistent with granting that permission. This argument might be educative: if discriminators could buy the right to discriminate, perhaps discrimina- tion would not be stigmatized in the way we want. Or it might be expressive: perhaps society would like to condemn discrimination quite apart from consequential arguments.272
In coming to terms with the issue of blocked exchanges, some further points are important. As noted, the recognition of diverse kinds of valuation might well be made part of a conception of law that places a high premium on individual liberty and choice. At least as a general rule, the state should not say that one kind of valuation will be required. Within broad outlines, people ought to be permitted to value
as they wish, though we should recognize that any kind of valuation will inevitably be affected by social norms and by law.
Moreover, there is an important difference between urging changes in social norms and urging changes in law. There may be a justified norm against asking a neighbor to mow one's lawn without a law to that effect. Similarly, one might speak on behalf of a powerful norm against certain attitudes toward animals without also recommending laws that, for example, forbid people to eat meat. It is possible to urge people to value animals in a certain way without thinking that the law should require that kind of valuation.
We might understand the distinction between norms and laws in two different ways. First, the distinction might be largely pragmatic. A law imposed on people who do not share the relevant norm may breed frustration and resentment. It may be counterproductive or futile. Second, the difference might be rooted in a principle of liberty, one that calls for a strong presumption in favor of governmental respect for diverse kinds of valuation. A legal mandate may be simply too sectarian or intrusive for a heterogeneous society. Both pragma- tism and principle seem to argue in favor of a sharp distinction between norms and law.
There is a final point. Markets are filled with agreements to transfer goods that are not valued simply for use. People purchase music, even if they regard the performances as deserving awe and wonder. They buy human care for their children.273 They trade the right to see beautiful areas. They purchase pets for whom they feel affection or even love, and whom they hardly regard as solely for human exploita- tion and use. The objection to the use of markets in certain areas must depend on the view that markets will have adverse effects on existing kinds of valuation, and it is not a simple matter to show when and why this will be the case. For all these reasons, opposition to commensurability, and insistence on diverse kinds of valuation, do not by themselves amount to opposition to market exchange, which is pervaded by choice among goods that participants value in diverse ways.
851
A belief in diverse kinds of valuation has consequences for current debates about the actual and appropriate nature of legal reasoning. If it can be shown that a well-functioning system of law is alert to these
A. Which Kinds of Valuation? To come to terms with the question of appropriate kinds of valuation, we should begin by asking whether diversity in kinds is desirable at all. Perhaps we should adopt a unitary kind of valuation, or seek to obtain some sort of commensurability. In many ways this project unites such diverse thinkers as Plato, Bentham, and, in law, Richard Posner.279 It seems clear that this approach would have many advantages. It would simplify and order decisions by placing the various goods along a single metric. According to one familiar conception of rationality, this step would increase rationality. Would it not be a large improvement if commensurability could be obtained?
Let us put law to one side for the moment and think about claims for unitariness and commensurability in human life generally. It seems obvious that an answer to this question should turn on what leads to a better conception of the human good. There is no transcendental or external standpoint from which to offer this answer. Our evaluation will inevitably be a reflection of what we think. But this should hardly be thought disabling.280 We might make some progress by considering what the world would be like if kinds of valuation really were unitary or if commensurability really did obtain. In such a world, for example, a loss of friendship or the death of a parent would achievement in something that one prizes - like art or musicwould be valued in the same way as an increase in net worth, or the birth of a new child, or falling in love, or the relief of human suffering, or the victory of a favorite sports team. Offers of cash exchange would really be evaluated solely on the basis of their amount. The distinction between instrumental and intrinsic goods would collapse, in the sense that many intrinsic goods would become both fungible and instrumental.
A great deal would be lost in such a world.282 A life with genuine commensurability would be flat and dehumanized. It would eliminate
delight, bewilderment, and surprise. It would be inconsistent with an appropriately diversified approach to a good human life. It would eliminate desirable relationships and attitudes. In fact it would be barely recognizable.283
On the other hand, nothing in this brief account is fatal to the view that law and public policy sometimes ought to rest on unitary kinds of valuation or on assumptions of commensurability. It is possible to think that under ideal conditions, the best system of valuation is diverse and plural, but that in light of the weaknesses of human institutions and the constant prospect of bias and arbitrariness, public choices should assume a single kind or a unitary metric as the best way of promoting all of the relevant goods.284 This question cannot be answered a priori or in the abstract. But those who favor legal approaches based on unitary kinds of valuation and commensurability should understand that their approach is best defended as a means of overcoming certain institutional obstacles, and not as reflecting a fully adequate understanding of the relevant problems. I have suggested as well that even if, say, government officials align the diverse effects of regulation along a single metric, they should also provide a disaggregated picture, so that citizens can be aware of qualitative differences and of the various goods at stake.
All this leaves much uncertainty. But it does suggest that, institutional issues aside, we should approve of a large degree of diversity in kinds of valuation. From this it does not follow that any particular kind of valuation is appropriate for any particular sphere. To evaluate kinds of valuation, we also have to think very concretely about what kinds in what places are parts of a good life or a good political system. To come to terms with this question, it would be necessary to say a great deal. For present purposes, a few observations may suffice to give a sense of the sorts of things that might emerge.
Some families exist in which people are valued solely for their use, and this is a pervasive source of deprivation and injustice.285 A family
in which reason-giving is the sole or pervasive kind of valuation would have different problems but it seems clear that it would have problems as well. The bonds that unite people in a family are not adequately captured by the exchange of reasons. But this is not to say that injustice within families cannot be exposed through that exchange. A measure of respect is a condition for a well-functioning relationship between spouses.286
So, too, a political system dominated not by reasons but instead by self-interested bargaining may well produce inferior law, and precisely because the absence of reason-giving will fail to uncover difficulties with some of the various proposals.287 Such a political system will also violate principles of political equality to the extent that it allows the translation of economic disparities into law. A political system that depended on bonds of affection or love would probably prove un- workable, certainly in a large, heterogeneous society.
These various observations are no more than assertions. They are meant simply to point toward the sorts of concrete inquiries that are required for an evaluation of what kinds of valuation are appropriate in what contexts. 856
B. Choices Among Incommensurable Goods
How are choices made among incommensurable goods? How can those choices be assessed? The first point is that there is no algorithm or formula by which to answer this question. If we are looking for a certain sort of answer - the sort characteristic of some believers in commensurability - we will be unable to find it. Relatively little can be said in the abstract. Instead we need to offer detailed descriptions of how such choices are made, and how to tell whether such choices turn out well. Here there are many possible criteria for public and private action, and a mere reference to the existence of incommensurabilities will be unhelpful standing by itself.
The search for criteria may well emphasize the need to secure a form of narrative continuity within a life or within a society. When someone chooses one option over another, it may be because the chosen option makes for coherence over the course of time, whereas the disregarded option, even if attractive, would ensure that things make little or no sense. There is also a connection between different selfunderstandings and the choice between incommensurable options A
and B. The selected option may conform to the agent's preferred selfunderstanding. To achieve that self-understanding, we need to be clear about what we value most deeply and to make choices that properly express the deepest valuations.288 Thus, for example, it may be irrational to value a certain amount of cash over spending time with one's family, because this would lead to a self-understanding that is either inconsistent with what has gone before or otherwise indefensible for those asking what a good life contains. Individual and social ideals play a large role in this assessment.289 These are inadequate and abstract remarks, but they may help explain how choices are made among incommensurables, and how choices tend to go right or wrong.
Some of the same things can be said of law and the public sphere. Suppose that a society is deciding whether to sacrifice a number of jobs in return for protecting an endangered species. No unitary metric can be helpful here. But perhaps the people entrusted with the power of decision will ask, as part of the inquiry, about the society's prevailing ideals, about ways minimally to damage relevant goods, and about what decision best fits with the community's self-understanding as this has been established over time. This is not merely a descriptive inquiry. It involves asking what choice puts that self-understanding in its best or most attractive light. On this view, choice among incommensurables is an act of interpretation, one that involves a dimension of fidelity to the past, but that is also constructive.290
In law and politics, a diverse set of standards - liberty, equality, prosperity, excellence, all of these umbrella terms - will be brought to bear on hard cases. A particular goal is to find solutions that will minimally damage the relevant goods. Perhaps an approach that promotes a recognizable form of liberty will only modestly compromise a recognizable conception of equality. Here too there is no escape from close examination of particular cases.
Consider, for example, the issue of surrogacy. It would be plausi- ble to conclude that the legal system ought not to criminalize surrogacy but also ought not to require surrogate mothers to hand over their children to the purchasing parents, at least during a brief period
after birth.291 Criminalization would entail difficult enforcement problems and might also discourage arrangements that do much good and little harm. We can understand why surrogacy arrangements might be thought to be connected with sex inequality, but the contribution to discrimination is probably too attenuated to justify criminalization. On the other hand, it may be damaging to the birth mother to force her to hand over a child against her will, especially because before the fact it may be quite difficult for her to know exactly what this action entails. The failure of the legal system to order specific performance is unlikely to have serious adverse consequences on prospective participants in such arrangements. This is of course an inadequate treatment of a complex problem. All I mean to do is to suggest some of the lines along which the inquiry might occur. (Compare an approach that would insist on commensurability. Such an approach would be laughably inadequate it would prevent us from seeing what is really at stake.)
Much of the relevant work here is done in two ways: through analogies and through understanding consequences, mediated as these are through expressive norms. When incommensurable goods are at stake, it is typically asked: What was the resolution of a previous case with similar features? Through this process, people seek to produce vertical and horizontal consistency among their various judgments. This system of testing is designed not to line goods up along a single metric, but to produce the sort of consistency and rigor that characterizes the successful operation of practical reason. The inquiry into consequences avoids monism while still examining the real-world effects of different courses of action. How, for example, will a particular re- sult compromise or promote the relevant goods? This is a characteristic part of practical reasoning in law.
In the context of emissions trading in environmental law, for example, it seems hard to support the empirical claim that the shift from command-and-control government to financial incentives will have serious adverse effects on people's thinking about pollution. Many claims about the educative function of law are actually claims about real-world consequences, understood through expressive norms on which there is no dispute. It is possible to think well about those consequences, and sometimes we can see that the feared effects will not materialize. In this way it is possible to explore whether there will be damage to some of the goods that are allegedly threatened by certain
initiatives. Of course it is true that, on some issues, we will lack relevant data.

C. A Note on Tragedy
There is a final point. A recognition of incommensurability is necessary to keep alive the sense of tragedy, and in certain ways this is an individual and collective good, perhaps especially in law.292 Recogni- tion that all outcomes "impose costs" is not quite the same thing as a sense of tragedy. Though I can hardly discuss this complex matter here, the very notion of tragedy seems to embody a commitment to an understanding of the uniqueness of certain goods, or the irreversibility and irreplaceability of certain losses.293 If tragedy were understood to mean instead high costs, or the existence of losses that accompany benefits (Kaldor-Hicks rather than Pareto improvements, for example), the sense of tragedy would be dramatically changed. Here too we would not have a simple redescription of the problem.
A sense of tragedy is an individual good because it accompanies certain relationships and attitudes that are an important part of a good life. It is a collective good for this reason and also because it focuses attention on the fact that, even when the law is doing the right thing, all things considered, much may be lost as well. This is valuable in, for example, current thinking about the environment and occupational safety. In the presence of tragedy, there is a large incentive to create social arrangements so that people do not face that prospect.
This is so with respect to pervasive conflicts among valuable things - employment versus environment, diminishing poverty versus national security, attention to family versus attention to work. Such conflicts themselves may be an artifact of legal and social arrangements. On monistic theories of value, it is easy to believe that nothing is really lost - or at least nothing that is unique, intrinsically valuable, or irretrievable. This understanding diminishes the incentive to find a solution that will not create tragic choices. When tragedy is understood to be present, there is a constant and conspicuous social interest in seeking solutions that simultaneously promote all of the relevant goods. At its best, the Anglo-American legal system is alert to the fact that diverse goods are at stake in many disputes. Judges know that not all of these goods can simultaneously be preserved. This awareness is itself desirable because of the pressure that it tends to exert on
judges and legislators as well. A redescription of tragedy in terms that assume a monistic theory of value would not create the same sort of pressure.
Human beings value goods, events, and relationships in diverse and plural ways. Sometimes we face serious problems of commensurability. This problem does not entail paralysis, indeterminacy, or arbitrariness. Decisions are made all the time among incommensurable goods, at the personal, social, and legal levels, and these decisions may well be rational or irrational. It might even be possible to convert our kinds of valuation for use on a unitary metric, or to make goods, events, and relationships commensurable. But if what I have said here is correct, this would be a sort of tragedy, not least because it would make the very fact of tragedy puzzling or even incomprehensible.
The fact of diverse kinds of valuation, and the existence of incommensurable goods, have not yet played a major role in legal theory. But these issues underlie a surprisingly wide range of legal disputes. No unitary "top-down" theory can account for the complexities of most controversies in law. Perhaps most dramatically, the liberal insistence on social differentiation - markets, families, religious groups, politics, and more - is best justified as an attempt to make a space for distinct kinds of valuation and to give each of them its appropriate place in human life. The Establishment and Equal Protection Clauses are centrally concerned with regulating kinds of valuation. In environmental law, the major issue of contestation is frequently the appropriate kind of valuation of environmental amenities if beaches, species, and mountains were valued solely for their use, we would not be able to understand them in the way that we now do.
The same issue arises in the law of contract, especially in the award of specific performance remedies. It also plays a role in thinking about the point of damage remedies in tort. In both settings, it is wrong to ignore the highly contextual nature of choice and to act as if a particular decision - not to take out insurance for a certain danger, to accept a job at a certain risk premium - reflects some global judgment simply adaptable for policy use. No global judgment need underlie particular choices. Many blocked exchanges, moreover, attest to social resistance to commensurability. I have also suggested that attention to these issues shows that cost-benefit analysis is obtuse, because it aligns qualitatively distinct goods along a single metric. Instead of cost-benefit analysis - which might of course be helpful in our at most secondbest world - what is desirable is a disaggregated picture of the effects
