      <p>I.</p>
      <p>Of the numerous writings surrounding the debate over the
American Constitution, The FederalistNo. 101 is probably the most
important. In that essay, Madison set out the somewhat surprising thesis
that a large republic would be better able than a small one to
promote traditional republican goals. According to Madison, a small
republic would likely be ridden by factional warfare. In a large
republic, by contrast, public-spirited representatives would emerge.
Such representatives, Madison claimed, would have the wisdom and
the virtue to escape parochial pressures and to promote deliberation
in government. A large republic would contain so many factions
that they would effectively offset each other. The result would be an
increased likelihood that the system will be protected against the
effects of factionalism and that republican deliberation will actually
occur. Interest-group trade offs - the grant of wealth or
opportunity to A rather than to B simply because of A's political power
would therefore be reduced or eliminated.</p>
      <p>These aspects of The FederalistNo. 10 are highly congenial to many
modern readers.2 But other aspects are more controversial.</p>

      <p>1. THE FEDERALIST No. 10 (J. Madison).</p>
      <p>2. But not for all; a belief in local self-determination is a prominent theme in
modem political and constitutional thought. See, e.g., B. BARBER, STRONG DEMOCRACY 117

        <title>Madison suggests that:</title>
        <p>The diversity in the faculties of men from which the rights of
property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a
uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first
object of Government. From the protection of different and
unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different
degrees and kinds of property immediately results ....3
And Madison doses the essay by emphasizing the advantages of the
proposed constitution in countering "a rage for paper money, for
an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any
other improper or wicked project." 4</p>
        <p>In this respect, there are powerful antiegalitarian and
antidemocratic dimensions in The Federalist No. 10. The insulation of
representatives from popular will appears to be intended not only to
promote deliberation, but also to protect against popular desires for
the redistribution of wealth and entitlements. Indeed, the two
themes were merged in much of the thinking of the Framers.
Factionalism was sometimes thought to consist precisely in changes in
the existing distribution of property., In this sense,
constitutionalism was designed partly as a self-conscious check on democracy - a
notion that came up frequently in the constitutional convention.</p>
        <p>It is instructive to compare Madison's claims in The FederalistNo.

the Democratic nomination for the presidency in'1936. Roosevelt

Ideas of this sort contributed to Roosevelt's eventual
endorsement of a "second Bill of Rights," available to all "regardless of
station, race, or creed," and including:</p>

        <p>The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of
old age, sickness, accident and unemployment; [and]</p>
        <p>The right to a good education. 7</p>
        <p>The New Deal understanding of the functions of
constitutionalism, embodied in Roosevelt's program for constitutional reform,
thus departed dramatically from the original conception. In the
New Deal reformulation, constitutionalism was no longer to be
regarded as a check on popular demands for the redistribution of
wealth and entitlements. On the contrary, constitutionalism was
intended to promote at least a certain degree of redistribution.
Roosevelt was of course no socialist; he believed strongly in both
private property and private industry. His goal was to soften the
harsh edges of the economic system, not to overturn it. But a
principal purpose of the New Deal was to protect the poor and the
disadvantaged from the risks of the marketplace. In the New Deal
period, such efforts at protection did not appear to be a product of
"faction," or to represent raw interest-group transfers, but were
instead a plausible outcome of a deliberative process among citizens
and representatives. The point holds even though some of the
innovations of the New Deal period turned out to be difficult to
defend on economic or noneconomic grounds.</p>
        <p>Thus the insulation of administrative officials from political
pressure - a prominent New Deal theme - was designed to allow for a
measure of government intrusion on the privileges of powerful
private groups. In this respect, Roosevelt's version of
constitutionalism endorsed the Madisonian belief in the insulation of political
actors from parochial pressures, but to bring about, rather than to
prevent, collective action to redistribute resources.</p>
        <p>The refashioning of the constitutional structure during the period
of the New Deal sheds considerable light both on the original
framework and on current constitutional predicaments. Indeed, the New
Deal period furnishes some basis, though partial and indirect, for
understandings of the original system that can be roughly associated
with the work of Charles Beard - a conclusion that should not be
[VOL. 56:114
surprising in light of the fact that Beard was a part of the
progressive movement, which provided much of the underpinning of the
New Deal. In this essay, I explore some of the central economic
commitments of the original constitutional design, not by offering
biographical data about the Framers, but by pointing to a number of
features of that design and by providing a comparison of the
original document with the New Deal reforms.</p>
        <p>During the celebration of the bicentennial, it is important to
appreciate not only the achievements of the Constitution's original
drafters, but also those of others who have affected the meaning and
structure of the Constitution. One need look no further than the
founding generation itself for counsel of this sort. It was Thomas
Jefferson who asserted that members of the preceding age were
"very like the present, but without the experience of the present,",
and who criticized those who "look at constitutions with
sanctimonious reverence, and deem them like the ark of the covenant, too
sacred to be touched." 9 Jefferson advised: "Let us ... [not] weakly
believe that one generation is not as capable as another of taking
care of itself,and of ordering its own affairs.... [T]he dead have no
rights."10 Of those who followed this advice, those associated with
the New Deal reformulation - above all Franklin Roosevelt -
occupy a singularly important place.</p>
        <p>Three basic commitments underlay the original constitutional
design. The first was to some form of "limited government,"
understood in a vaguely libertarian fashion; the second was to a system of
checks and balances; the third was to federalism. The three
commitments were closely allied. The institutional principles of the system
were designed to serve the substantive belief in rights of private
property and contract.</p>
        <p>The substantive commitment, reflected in The Federalist No. 10,
was to a degree of immunity from government incursions into the
private realm - whether those incursions were supported by a
minority or a majority. Thus the original Constitution singled out
protection of private contract as one of its rare safeguards of
substantive rights; and the Eminent Domain Clause, protecting
private property, was a prominent feature of the Bill of Rights. It
would be a mistake to suggest that the Framers intended to abolish
all of what we would currently describe as redistribution of
prop8. Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Samuel Kercheval (July 12, 1816), reprintedin

erty, but there can be little doubt that their conception of private
rights led to deep suspicion about forms of government action that
are now taken as unobjectionable. Modern zoning regulation, social
security, minimum-wage and maximum-hour provisions,
occupational safety and health controls, environmental measures, labor
and civil rights laws - all of these would likely have been quite
mysterious to the founding generation.</p>
        <p>At the national level, a variety of efforts were made to insulate
public representatives from constituent pressures, in the interest of
bringing about a kind of deliberative democracy. Modem pluralist
or economic theories, understanding the political process as a kind
of market among self-interested actors, were thus rejected by the
Framers at both the positive and normative levels. Well aware of
the risks posed by self-interested private groups, the founding
generation sought not to ensure an equilibrium among those groups,
but instead to insulate representatives from factions in order to
promote the performance of deliberative tasks. Thus the President was
to be selected by the electoral college, a deliberative body. The
Senate was to be elected indirectly; only members of the House of
Representatives were to be elected directly.</p>
        <p>In the premium placed by the Framers on deliberative democracy,
it is possible to see the impact of classical republican thought on the
constitutional framing - a significant theme of modern historians
writing on the founding period. The Framers did not disparage
civic virtue, or believe that self-interest was the inevitable motivating
force of human behavior. As Hamilton wrote in The FederalistNo. 55,
"[a]s there is a degree of depravity in mankind, which requires a
certain degree of circumspection and distrust: So there are other
qualities in human nature, which justify a certain portion of esteem
and confidence."' 1 Thus the Framers emphasized, time and again,
their hope and expectation that virtuous leaders would emerge in a
national republic.</p>
        <p>In recent years, there have been many efforts to understand the
Framers as thoroughgoing modernist skeptics - indeed as
forerunners of Chicago-school economists - treating economic
self-interest as the basis of political conduct and understanding the task of
representatives as the largely mechanical one of translating the
political power of various constituents into political outcomes. Such
efforts are badly off the mark; they read into the period of the
framing something that simply was not there.1 2</p>
        <p>But the Framers did not believe that a system of deliberative
representation was sufficient in itself. The system of checks and
balances was designed to serve a variety of supplemental functions,
providing safeguards in the event of a breakdown in representative
processes. That system would, for example, furnish a measure of

[VOL. 56:114
protection against factionalism; some groups might be able to usurp
the power of one branch, but they would be unlikely to obtain
power over all three. At the same time, checks and balances would
diminish the risk that rulers might have and act upon interests
adverse to those of the ruled - to minimize what we might now call
"agency costs." In the words of The Federalist No. 51, "[a]mbition
must be made to counteract ambition," and incursions by
government restricted.13 Moreover, as Montesquieu suggested, a system
of separated powers should naturally produce "a state of repose or
inaction."' 4 The result would be to promote stability, to disable the
public sphere at least in some respects,' 5 and to protect-the private
spheres of property and contract. In this last sense in particular, the
institution of checks and balances comfortably coexisted with the
substantive understanding underlying the original system.</p>
        <p>The federal system provided an additional set of safeguards.
Thus The FederalistNo. 51 understands federalism as a kind of
vertical separation of powers, protecting private rights:</p>
        <p>In the compound republic of America, the power surrendered by
the people, is first divided between two distinct governments, and
then the portion allotted to each subdivided among distinct and
separate departments. Hence a double security arises to the
rights of the people. The different governments will controul
each other; at the same time that each will be controuled by
itself."' 6
In this respect, federalism operated in the service of limited
government. Under an approach that sees freedom in immunity from
governmental restraints, this additional safeguard is highly desirable.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the federal structure provided a set of
opportunities for local self-determination. This was an entirely distinct
strand in federalist theory. The idea here is that local
self-government furnished a vehicle for active citizen participation in a largely
commercial republic. The traditional republican goal of local
selfdetermination17 was thus promoted through a two-tier set of
governing bodies. Madisonian representation at the national level,
supplemented by a system of checks and balances, was accompanied by
state and local avenues for self-government. The state and national

splitting the legislative and executive functions; and an energetic executive was of course

governments were also intended to "controul each other,"' 8
providing a kind of vertical check and balance that would also work to
promote liberty.</p>
        <p>Judicial review of course fit comfortably with this system.
Insulated actors would check majoritarian excesses, often redistributive
or the result of factionalism, and furnish a final set of constraints on
the operation of democracy. It was for this reason that the
Federalists readily rejected concerns raised by the Anti-Federalists, who
were fearful that judicial review would create a "countermajoritarian
difficulty" of the kind that has been so prominent in recent
constitutional theory.</p>
        <p>What emerges from this brief sketch is a system in which
constitutionalism operated as a self-conscious series of checks on the
operation of democracy - a system designed to prevent factionalism and
self-interested representation, but also to protect the existing
distribution of wealth. It is hardly necessary to examine the economic
incentives of the Framers, or to attribute to them sinister motives, to
agree that one purpose of the original system was to guard a large
set of individual rights, including the prerogatives of private
property and contract. The structure of the original Constitution itself
furnishes powerful evidence for that view.</p>
        <p>Each of the original constitutional commitments traced above is
recognizable as part of the modern constitutional structure. But
each of them has undergone considerable reformulation since the
framing. A principal source of the reformulation is the New Deal,
which altered the original system in a number of ways.' 9 First, the
preexisting understanding of legal entitlements, with its heavy
emphasis on the protection of wealth and property from democratic
control, was rejected. For the New Deal reformers, the common law
system of private rights was a regulatory system, serving the
interests of some at the expense of others; it had no prepolitical status.
The Supreme Court's conclusion, in Lochner v. New York, 20 that
regulatory measures should be understood as a sort of "taking" from A
for the benefit of B depended on a view that the common law was
natural and prepolitical.2 1 The very notion of a taking depends on
an antecedent theory of entitlement, and the baselines drawn from
the common law and the existing distribution of wealth and
entitlements underlay pre-New Deal understandings. In West CoastHotel v.
Parrish,22 by contrast, the Court stated that the failure to establish
minimum wages could be understood as providing a kind of
"sub18. THE FEDERALIST No. 51, supra note 13, at 351.</p>
        <p>19. The New Deal was not, however, a sudden break from tradition. It should be
seen as the culmination of a longer period of administrative and institutional
development. See S. SKOWRONEK, BUILDING A NEW AMERICAN STATE 288-89 (1982).

sidy for unconscionable employers." 23 This opinion reflected a
dramatic shift in the baselines from which legal decisions were made, a
shift that upset original understandings about the primacy of
property rights.</p>
        <p>The understanding that the common law was constructed rather
than natural led to a dramatically different conception of legal
entitlements. In the New Deal period, the previous catalogue appeared
both over- and underinclusive. Some items that were treated as
legally protected rights became subjects for legal intervention. In
particular, rights of private property were no longer immunized
from state control. To a large degree this understanding derived
from a perception that rights of property were not prepolitical but a
product of positive law, above all the law of trespass. 24 Because
such rights were socially constructed rather than natural, they were
permissible objects of legal control.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the New Deal reformation led to a belief that
interests that were previously seen as legal gratuities, or more often
a product ofprivate charity, should be protected by the legal system.
Hence, for example, Roosevelt's "second Bill of Rights." More
concretely, the New Deal period resulted in the creation of legal rights
in the form of regulatory protection against poverty,
unemployment, accident, disease, oppression by employers, and a wide range
of related harms. In this system, factionalism was seen not as the
redistribution of property rights, but as the insulation of existing
practice from collective control. This theme - a dramatic
departure from original constitutional principles - played a prominent
role throughout Roosevelt's presidency. Some of the New Deal
initiatives, particularly in the area of economic regulation, were built
on shaky foundations. But the understanding that factionalism
could manifest itself in government inaction rather than action and
the concern that failure to protect the disadvantaged could itself be
a product of interest-group power were fundamental.</p>
        <p>Understandings of this sort had drastic institutional implications.
In particular, they led quite naturally to skepticism about the
original system of checks and balances and about tripartite government.
That system was closely associated with the common law and with
the system of laissez-faire, because as we have seen, it "naturally
form[ed] a state of repose or inaction. ' 25 The most radical
suggestions of the time called for a total abolition of checks and balances in
favor of a concentration of power in one entity. Those suggestions
23. Id. at 399.</p>
        <p>24. This was of course a prominent theme in the legal realist movement. See Hale,

(1923).</p>
        <p>25. See supra note 14 and accompanying text.
were repudiated, but some of the impetus behind them was
reflected in the enthusiasm for an increase in presidential power and
for administrative regulation. The result was that the system of
tripartite government was substantially altered. Power that was
formerly exercised by Congress and by common law courts was
concentrated in the presidency.28 Administrative agencies
combined traditionally separated functions. In both cases, the goal was
to ensure an institutional structure accommodating the belief that
national intervention into the economic structure should be
facilitated rather than blocked.</p>
        <p>At the same time, original understandings of federalism were
significantly altered. The states, it was thought, were too large to
provide genuine self-determination. The notion that the states and the
federal government should control each other by ensuring a kind of
stasis - the idea of vertical separation of powers - seemed
perverse. Finally, states had proved themselves ineffectual in dealing
with social and economic problems. The depression of the 1930s is
of course the critical development here. In the New Deal
reformation, it was the presidency, not the states, that was the locus of
selfgovernment. In a single stroke, this understanding allied
Hamiltonian beliefs in a strong executive with Jeffersonian
aspirations for genuine self-determination by the citizenry.</p>
        <p>The New Deal thus produced a radically different constitutional
structure, one that sheds considerable light on the purposes and
effects of the original framework and on the origins of current
constitutional predicaments. During the New Deal period, the original
understanding of rights was substantially altered, the system of
tripartite government was abandoned, and federalism took a
significantly different form. Most modern constitutional controversies
arise out of nostalgia for the original framework, on one or more of
these fronts, or from concern that the insights of the New Deal
period have been taken insufficiently far.</p>
        <p>IV</p>
        <p>This is hardly the place to evaluate the claims made by those
skeptical about the New Deal reformulation. We may suggest, however,
that the New Deal rejection of the federal system was far too
cavalier. The President does not provide an avenue for
self-determination by the citizenry, and national solutions have often ignored the
need, emphasized by the Framers, for diversity and flexibility in a
large republic. There is a continuing need to achieve traditional
republican goals of local self-determination, though avenues are not
simple to find. Moreover, the New Deal enthusiasm for technocratic
government, embodied in the belief in regulatory administration,
has proved myopic. Failure in regulatory implementation has been
relatively common. In the last twenty-five years, there have thus
been efforts on the part of the three constitutionally specified
26. See T. Lowi, THE PERSONAL PRESIDENT 57-58 (1985).
[VOL. 56:114
branches to oversee regulatory performance, and those efforts have
often operated in the service of the substantive agenda of the New
Deal.</p>
        <p>With respect to the new conception of rights, in some ways the
New Deal reformulation did not go far enough. Much of modem
law depends on common law or status quo baselines. Most
strikingly, common law categories continue to exert a powerful hold on
modem administrative law. Consider the definition of liberty and
property interests, where the Court distinguishes between benefits
created by the government and those said to be simply "given." In
the areas of standing27 and reviewability28 the Court continues to
treat the beneficiaries of regulatory statutes less generously than
regulated class members, in part because the latter, unlike the
former, are always able to point to a common law interest. Consider as
well the areas of discrimination on the basis of race and sex.
Discriminatory effects are constitutionally unobjectionable, affirmative
action is seen as constitutionally troublesome, and both of these
conclusions depend on the idea that the existing distribution of
benefits and burdens as between whites and blacks and men and women
should be seen as simply "there."</p>
        <p>However the future may treat the legacy of the original
constitutional framework and the New Deal reformulation, an
understanding of the 1930s illustrates the variety of possible relationships
between constitutionalism and democracy. Historians have recited
a large number of reasons for skepticism toward Charles A. Beard's
thesis about the relationship between the economic self-interest of
the Framers and the Constitution. Beard and his followers were far
too crude in this regard, and they undervalued the breadth and the
power of central features of the Framers' vision. But the
progressive historians were correct in pointing to the central importance of
controversial understandings of private property to the original
constitutional regime, and the ways in which those understandings have
been repudiated in modem political and constitutional thought. In
a time in which the nation celebrates the enormous achievements of
the drafters of the original document, it is important to remember
the accomplishments of others who have played a role in developing
the modem constitutional structure. This category includes not
merely the most important Justices of the Supreme Court, but a
small group of others who have attained the status of constitutional
