      <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
      <p>Constitutional law tends, to define itself through reaction to great
cases. The defining case for the last several decades was Brown v. Board
of Education'-an example of social reorganization, in the interest of a
racial minority, brought about through the judiciary. Roe v. Wade2 has
to some extent played this role for the past decade, and its status as a
defining case may grow larger in the next generation. But for more
than a half-century, the most important of all defining cases has been
Lochner v. New York. 3 The spectre of Lochner has loomed over most
important constitutional decisions, whether they uphold or invalidate
governmental practices.4 In the different answers to the question, what
was wrong with the decision in Lochner?, can be found the various
posi* Professor of Law, University of Chicago. This is a revised version of the Samuel
tions on most of the major constitutional issues of the modem era.5</p>
      <p>The received wisdom is that Lochner was wrong because it involved
'judicial activism": an illegitimate intrusion by the courts into a realm
properly reserved to the political branches of government. This view
has spawned an enormous literature6 and takes various forms. 7 The
basic understanding has been endorsed by the Court in many cases
taking the lesson of the Lochner period to be the need for judicial deference
to legislative enactments. 8</p>
      <p>The principal purpose of this essay, descriptive in character, is to
understand Lochner from a different point of view. For the Lochner
Court, neutrality, understood in a particular way, was a constitutional
requirement. The key concepts here are threefold: government
inaction, the existing distribution of wealth and entitlements, and the
baseline set by the common law. Governmental intervention was
constitutionally troublesome, whereas inaction was not; and both neutrality
and inaction were defined as respect for the behavior of private actors
pursuant to the common law, in light of the existing distribution of
wealth and entitlements. Whether there was a departure from the
requirement of neutrality, in short, depended on whether the
government had altered the common law distribution of entitlements. Market
ordering under the common law was understood to be a part of nature
rather than a legal construct, and it formed the baseline from which to
measure the constitutionally critical lines that distinguished action from
inaction and neutrality from impermissible partisanship. This
understanding of the Lochner period is faithful to what the Court said when it
both engaged in and abandoned Lochner-like reasoning, and it points to
an important element in the Lochner Court's approach, one that has
little to do with an aggressive judicial role in general. 9</p>
      <p>
        5. The view that Lochner was wrong is not, however, unanimously held. See R.
Epstein, Takings: Private Property and the Law of Eminent Domain 5 (

        7. Sometimes the view is based on the text of the Constitution and the "intent" of
its framers, see, e.g., Monaghan, Our Perfect Constitution, 56 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 353
(1981); sometimes it is based on conceptions of democracy, see, e.g., Bork, Neutral
Principles and Some First Amendment Problems, 47 Ind.L.J. 1 (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">1971</xref>
        ); sometimes it grows
out of"process-perfecting" theories, see, e.g.,J. Ely, supra note 6, at 73, 228-29 n.91;
sometimes it depends on distinctions between matters of policy, to be resolved by the
legislature, and matters of principle, to be resolved by the courts, see R. Dworkin,
Taking Rights Seriously (1979).

      <p>9. Whether this understanding of Lochner should be accepted in place of one that
stresses an active judicial role is an inescapably normative question, taken up infra notes
144-67 and accompanying text. The principal effort here is to set forth an alternative
approach that fits the history at least as well and that has dramatically different
implications. See infra notes 168-205 and accompanying text. Moreover, this understanding</p>
      <p>Understood in this way, however, Lochner has many descendants in
current law. Numerous decisions depend in whole or in part on
common law baselines or understandings of inaction and neutrality that
owe their origin to Lochner-like understandings. And if Lochneris
understood in these terms, its heirs are not Roe v. Wade10 and Miranda v.</p>

      <title>Arizona," but instead such decisions as Washington v. Davis,12 Buckley v.</title>
      <p>Valeo,13 Regents of California v. Bakke, 14 and various cases immunizing
those who are thought not to be "state actors" from constitutional
constraints. These and other decisions can be understood from a unitary
perspective through the lens of the Lochner period. Such a perspective
may or may not justify dramatic departures from current law. It may be
that modem doctrine, insofar as it shares Lochner's premises, is entirely
unobjectionable.</p>
      <p>The second purpose of the essay is normative. To some degree,
Lochner-like themes are so deeply ingrained in the constitutional order,
indeed in the very concept of constitutionalism, 15 that it would be
hopeless to attempt to abandon them even if it were desirable to do so.
But in some settings, the modem progeny of Lochner, like Lochner itself,
depend on false premises and lead to unfortunate results. Most
important, the baselines selected by the Court and the use of the key
concepts -"neutrality" and "inaction"- are often a mistake, for the same
reasons that originally led to the rejection of Lochner and the common
law system of regulation generally. The eventual task is to design a set
of constitutional doctrines that does not derive from common law rules
but that instead builds on still-emerging principles that might be
roughly associated with the New Deal. The final section of this Article
ventures some thoughts on how to accomplish that task.</p>
      <p>Almost eighty years since the case was decided, the lesson of the
Lochner period has yet to be settled. The purpose of this Article is to
suggest that the case should be taken to symbolize not merely an
aggressive judicial role, but an approach that imposes a constitutional
requirement of neutrality, and understands the term to refer to
preservation of the existing distribution of wealth and entitlements
under the baseline of the common law. Thus understood, Lochner has
hardly been overruled.

      <sec id="sec-2-1">
        <title>I. THE RsE AND FALL (?) OF LOCHNER</title>
        <p>It will be useful to begin with excerpts from two important
decisions associated with the Lochner period. The first excerpt is from</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>Adkins v. Childrens Hospital,16 a 1923 decision invalidating minimum</title>
      <p>wage legislation for women and children. The Court said:
To the extent that the sum fixed [by the minimum wage
statute] exceeds the fair value of the services rendered, it amounts
to a compulsory exaction from the employer for the support of
a partially indigent person, for whose condition there rests
upon him no peculiar responsibility, and therefore, in effect,
arbitrarily shifts to his shoulders a burden which, if it belongs
to anybody, belongs to society as a whole.' 7</p>
      <p>The next excerpt is from the case generally thought to spell the
downfall ofLochner. In the 1937 decision of West Coast Hotelv. Parrish,Is
the Court upheld a minimum wage law for women. The Court said:
The exploitation of a class of workers who are in an unequal
position with respect to bargaining power and are thus
relatively defenceless against the denial of a living wage.., casts a
direct burden for their support upon the community. What
these workers lose in wages the taxpayers are called upon to
pay .... The community is not bound to provide what is in
effect a subsidy for unconscionable employers.' 9</p>
      <p>The notion of subsidy is of course incoherent without a baseline
from which to make a measurement. Both of these excerpts refer to
subsidies, but by the time of West Coast Hotel, the concept has been
turned on its head. In Adkins, the Court saw minimum wage legislation
as requiring a subsidy to the public from an innocent employer. Such
legislation was thus a kind of "taking" from A to B. According to the
Court, if B is needy, it is not A, but the public at large, who should pay.
In West Coast Hotel, it is the failure of a state to have minimum wage
legislation that amounts to a subsidy--this time, from the public to the
employer.2 0 The common law system, for the West Coast Hotel Court,
turns out to subsidize "unconscionable employers." In the fifteen-year
period between Adkins and West Coast Hotel, the baseline has been
shifted. What accounts for the shift? In answering that question, it will
be useful to turn to Lochner itself.</p>

        20. To say this is not, of course, to suggest that minimum wage legislation was
constitutionally required. Notably, both Adkins and West Coast Hotel involved statutes
discriminating on the basis of gender; such statutes tended, in both purpose and effect, to
diminish the employment prospects of women. See Landes, The Effect of State
Maximum-Hours Laws on the Employment of Women in 1920, 88 J. Pol. Econ. 476 (1980);
Nelson, Women's Poverty and Women's Citizenship: Some Political Consequences of
Economic Marginality, 10 Signs 209, 228-29 (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">1984</xref>
        ).
      </p>
      <p>Lochner involved a regulation enacted by the state of New York
prohibiting employers from permitting or requiring bakers to work for
more than sixty hours in a week. The Court's analysis came in several
steps. The Court said that the right of contract-in particular, the right
to buy and sell labor-is part of the liberty protected by the due process
clause. But the Court recognized that the "police power" was available
to justify intrusions on liberty of contract; thus, for example, the
government could protect health or morals by restricting contractual
agreements. Here, however, the Court concluded that maximum hour
legislation was not permissible as a "labor law," because bakers were of
full legal capacity and "in no sense wards of the State." 21 Only wards
could be protected through labor legislation.</p>
      <p>The Court also concluded that the statute could not be defended
as a health law. The problem was that the state could not demonstrate
a close connection between maximum hour regulation and the
protection of health. There was no sufficient showing that a maximum hour
law was necessary to protect health; and if the evidence brought forth
here were thought sufficient, the state's power would be unlimited.
The Court concluded that the statute was "in reality, passed from...
motives" 22 other than protection of health-motives that were
illegitimate but that the Court did not specify.</p>
      <p>For the contemporary observer, two features of the Court's
approach are especially distinctive. The first is the sharp limitation of the
category of permissible government ends. Efforts to redistribute
resources and paternalistic measures were both constitutionally out of
bounds. They did not fall within the "police power"; the employer had
committed no common law wrong, and regulatory power was largely
limited to the redress of harms recognized at common law. This
limitation of the category of permissible ends had important implications,
excluding a wide range of measures enacted by majorities. The scope
of the "police power," as understood in the Lochner era, has never been
entirely clear.23 But there can be no doubt that most forms of
redistribution and paternalism were ruled out.</p>
      <p>The second step in the Court's approach consists of careful
scrutiny of the relationship between the permissible end invoked by the
state to support the statute and the means chosen by the state to
promote that end. The Court was unsatisfied by the claim that limitations
on working hours contributed to the health of bakers, notwithstanding
the plausible nature of the claim-hence Justice Harlan's powerful
dissent.24 It would thus be possible to accept, as did Justice Harlan, the
limitation of police power and at the same time to uphold the
legisla21. 198 U.S. at 57.

tion attacked in Lochner. On the other hand, one could reject both
features of the Court's approach, as did Justice Holmes in his famous
dissent.</p>
      <p>There is, moreover, a close relationship between the two elements
of the Court's approach; the one reinforces the other. The careful
scrutiny of means-ends connections operates to "flush out" 25
impermissible ends. If there is no class of impermissible ends, means-ends
scrutiny is incoherent.2 6 And by impermissible ends, the Court
appeared to be referring to what we may call "raw" interest-group
transfers.2 7 Because the only available public justifications were insufficient,
the minimum wage statute was invalidated as an interest-group deal,
reflecting nothing other than political power. Above all, the Court's
concern was that maximum hour legislation was partisan rather than
neutral-selfish rather than public-regarding. 28 It was neutrality that
the due process clause commanded, 2 9 and neutrality was served only by
the general or "public" purposes comprehended by the police power.
If the statute could be justified as a labor or health law, it would be
sufficiently public to qualify as neutral. Since no such justification was

123 (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">1972</xref>
        ).
      </p>
      <p>
        27. To say this is not to say that redistribution was always impermissible. Taxation
and other measures might redistribute wealth without running afoul of the due process
clause; and the poor laws were generally immune from constitutional attack. Grey, The
Malthusian Constitution, 41 U. Miami L. Rev. 21 (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">1986</xref>
        ). But redistribution on an ad
hoc basis, of the sort represented by maximum hour and minimum wage laws, was
unconstitutional if unsupported by a justification deemed "general" or "public." Cf.
Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. 381 (1798) (Chase, J.) (discussing natural law principles
prohibiting transfers from A to B).
      </p>
      <p>The preference for redistribution through taxation rather than regulation might
have been the product of the broader interest in promoting generality in lawmaking. If
redistribution is ad hoc, it could be perverse and in any event less visible. The
requirement of generality in redistribution promotes visibility and at the same time ensures that
any redistribution is to those genuinely or most in need. Compare the debate over
affirmative action, discussed infra text accompanying notes 113-17. The ad hoc character
of affirmative action schemes is sometimes thought to be an argument against them and
in favor of more general methods of alleviating the distribution of benefits and burdens
among blacks and whites. On the other hand, the requirement of generality might allow
well-organized private groups to mobilize in defense of the status quo. In this sense the
requirement fits comfortably with the broader hostility to redistribution.</p>
      <p>
        28. Stated in this way, the requirement remains the law. Statutory classifications
must be defensible as public-regarding under a wide range of constitutional provisions.
See Sunstein, Naked Preferences and the Constitution, 84 Colum. L. Rev. 1689 (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">1984</xref>
        );
for various defenses, see infra note 166. In the Lochner era, however, the category of
justifications that would count as "public" was small, excluding paternalistic and
redistributive matters. Cf. Hawaii Hous. Auth. v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229 (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">1984</xref>
        ) (rendering
meaningless the public use requirement under the eminent domain clause).

      <p>29. Cf. Wechsler, Toward Neutral Principles of Constitutional Law, 73 Harv. L.
Rev. 1 (1959) (discussing similar requirement of neutrality imposed on judges),

available, it was invalidated as impermissibly partisan-what might now
be called special-interest legislation. The legislative result was thus
unprincipled; it depended on "whose ox is gored." Under this
framework, the common law categories were taken as a natural rather than
social construct. The status of the common law as a part of nature
undergirded the view that the common law should form the baseline
from which to measure deviations from neutrality, or self-interested
3 0
"deals."</p>
      <p>Justice Holmes' celebrated dissenting opinion is a rejection of
neutrality altogether. It comes close to modem interest-group pluralism,
which treats the political process as an unprincipled struggle among
self-interested groups for scarce social resources.3 1 Under this view,
Lochner's means-ends scrutiny, examining whether there is a "public"
and hence neutral justification for the statute, is difficult to understand.
Holmes' opinion treats the political process as a kind of civil war, in
which the powerful succeed; if courts interfere, they will be bottling up
forces that will express themselves elsewhere in other and more
destructive forms.3 2 Thus for Holmes, the Constitution does not prevent
"the natural outcome of a dominant opinion." '33</p>
      <p>
        Holmes' opinion is probably best known for its apparent humility:
the rejection of Spencer's Social Statics,34 with which Holmes was
sympathetic as a matter of personal predilection; the proposition that the
Constitution does not embody any particular social and economic
theory; and its author's apparent willingness to disregard his personal
views in the process of constitutional interpretation. But the opinion is
30. Two qualifications are in order here. First, not every common law right was, by
virtue of its status as such, immunized from collective control. Marginal and
not-somarginal adjustments were permissible. Nonetheless, the basic framework of the
common law formed the baseline from which to decide cases. Indeed, one can trace to this
period the idea that legislative extinguishment of"core" common law rights was
permissible only if the legislature furnished an adequate alternative remedy. See, e.g., New
York Cent. R.R. v. White, 243 U.S. 188 (1917) (upholding workers' compensation in
part because of quid pro quo); see also Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envtl. Study Group,
438 U.S. 59, 88 &amp; n.32 (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">1978</xref>
        ) (upholding liability-limiting provisions of Price-Anderson
Act against due process challenge but suggesting relevance of quid pro quo).
      </p>
      <p>Second, the protection of common law rights depended not merely on the fact that
the rights at issue were protected by the common law, but also on the (unsurprising) fact
that the common law corresponded to a widely held normative theory about the proper
role of government. The interests protected at common law thus tracked the category of
natural rights. For a modern statement, see Epstein, A Theory of Strict Liability, 2 J.
Legal Stud. 151 (1973); R. Epstein, supra note 5.</p>
      <p>
        31. See, e.g., R. Dahl, A Preface to Democratic Theory (

of Economic Regulation, 2 Bell J. Econ. &amp; Mgmt. Sci. 3 (

best understood as an outgrowth of the very species of constitutional
social Darwinism that it purports to reject. Holmes' market-oriented
conception of politics and his skepticism about normative argument are
the very personal building blocks for his enthusiasm for judicial
deference. 3 5
      </p>
      <p>The decline of the Lochner understanding was slow and wavering.
In some cases the Court upheld statutes by deferring to claims of
plausible means-ends connections. Elsewhere the Court seemed gradually
to conclude that redistributive goals were permissibly public and thus
in some sense neutral, even if there was a departure from the common
law; the common law categories thus broke down.3 6 But it was in West
Coast Hotel that the Court rejected the theoretical foundations of the
Lochner period. The case involved a statute providing minimum wages
for women. Perhaps oddly, at least to modem readers, the emphasis of
the opinion was not on the undemocratic character of the Court's
previous approach or on the value ofjudicial deference to legislative
determinations. 3 7 Instead the Court stressed the need for minimum wage
regulation, referring to "the exploiting of workers at wages so low as to
be insufficient to meet the bare cost of living" and the fact that "the
exploitation of a class of workers who are in an unequal position with
respect to bargaining power casts a direct burden for their support
upon the community."3 8 In perhaps the most striking passage of the
opinion, the Court referred to the subsidy problem and added, "[t]he
community may direct its law-making power to correct the abuse which
springs from [employers'] selfish disregard of the public interest."' 39</p>
      <p>
        In the Lochner era itself, of course, the police power could not be
used to help those unable to protect themselves in the marketplace. 40
The expansion of the police power in West Coast Hotel signalled a critical
theoretical shift, amounting to a rejection of the Lochner Court's
conception of the appropriate baseline. The key lies in the notion that
failure to act would amount to "a subsidy for unconscionable employers."
The idea that what appears, in the Lochner framework, to be
government "inaction," or neutrality, might amount to a subsidy is at first
glance quite puzzling. The Court's claim is that the failure to impose a
minimum wage is not nonintervention at all but simply another form of
action-a decision to rely on traditional market mechanisms, within the
35. See, e.g., Rogat, supra note 32, at 251-55; Rogat &amp; O'Fallon, Mr. Justice

common law framework, as the basis for regulation. 41 West Coast Hotel
rests on an understanding that in any case, government-through
minimum wage laws or the common law system-is making a choice. The
common law could not be regarded as a natural or unchosen baseline.
The traditional treatment of the police power was unable to survive this
understanding. 42 For the Court in West Coast Hotel, the baseline for
analysis was instead a system in which all workers had a living wage.</p>
      <p>Similar developments occurred in other areas of the law. Consider
for example, the law of eminent domain, with which Lochner must be
closely associated: both involved perceived "takings" from A to B, and
an underlying framework built on common law baselines.4 3 Miller v.
Schoene 44 tested the constitutionality of a statute requiring the
destruction of ornamental cedar trees infected with a disease damaging to local
apple orchards. The owners of the cedar trees complained that the
statute amounted to a "taking" of their property for which
compensation was constitutionally required. The Court responded that "the
state was under the necessity of making a choice between the
preservation of one class of property and that of the other wherever both
existed in dangerous proximity. It would have been nonetheless a choice
if, instead of enacting the present statute, the state, by doing nothing,
had permitted serious injury to the apple orchards within its borders to
go unchecked. When forced to such a choice the state does not exceed
its constitutional powers by deciding upon the destruction of one class
of property in order to save another .... -45 This was so
notwithstanding the fact that the injury at issue was not tortious at common law. In
Miller as in West Coast Hotel, adherence to common law baselines no
longer seemed neutral, and departures from those baselines were no
longer impermissibly partisan. The same phenomenon occurred under
the contracts clause, as the Court expanded the range ofjustifications
that would allow the state to assert its "police power" in order to
abrogate private agreements. 4 6 In these circumstances it should be

      <p>Why this change should have occurred is a complex matter. In part, the Depression
was responsible; in a period of widespread poverty and unemployment, it became
harder to see nineteenth century market ordering as in the interest of all. In part, the
partial but increasing use of government power to alleviate suffering made the common
law system seem less and less natural and inviolate. See id. Consider in this regard
Franklin Roosevelt's suggestion: "We must lay hold of the fact that economic laws are
not made by nature. They are made by human beings." 1 Public Papers of Franklin D.

prising that Erie v. Tompkins, 4 7 the principal case recognizing the
constructed rather than prepolitical character of the common law, was
decided only one year after West Coast Hotel.</p>
      <p>We may thus understand Lochner as a case that failed because it
selected, as the baseline for constitutional analysis, a system that was
state-created, hardly neutral, and without prepolitical status. Once the
Court's baseline shifted, its analysis became impossible to sustain. As
every student of the law of torts is aware, one cannot treat as a "taking"
from A to B a decision to transfer resources to which A had no
entitlement in the first place. The whole notion of "taking" depends on a
belief in an antecedent right to the property in question. 48 Once the
common law itself was seen to allocate entitlements and wealth, and the
allocation seemed controversial, a decision to generate a new pattern of
distribution could not be for that reason impermissible.</p>
      <p>The defect of the Lochner era might, then, be understood in three
ways that are closely related but that have some significant differences
as well. In its narrowest form, the problem was the Court's decision to
take market ordering under the substantive standards of the common
law as the baseline from which to decide constitutional cases.4 9 In this
formulation, the difficulty lay in the use of the common law as the
starting point from which to administer the critical line distinguishing action
from inaction and partisanship from neutrality. More broadly, the
Lochner Court regarded consideration of "whose ox is gored"-when
those helped were the disadvantaged-as impermissible partisanship;
consideration of the plight of the disadvantaged was insufficiently
public or general and not neutral at all. This conclusion, reflecting a kind
of legal formality, turned out to depend on the antecedent selection of
a baseline grounded in the common law. More broadly still, the Court
took as natural and inviolate a system that was legally constructed and
took the status quo as the foundation from which to measure
neutrality.50 The use of the status quo as the foundation for measurement is
of course different from similar use of the common law. We shall see
both uses in the discussion to follow.</p>
      <p>These three understandings are closely related to one another.

      <p>49. The terms "common law" and "nineteenth century market ordering" will be
used interchangeably throughout; the reference is to the allocation of rights of use,
ownership, transfer, and possession of property associated with "laissez-faire" systems and
captured in the common law of the late nineteenth century. Of course common law
systems have not always taken this form, and market ordering could take place under
dramatically different allocations of entitlements.</p>

on the baseline used for measurement; thus the second defect
presupposes some variation on the first. The third understanding, stressing
use of the status quo, is in turn simply a generalization of the Lochner
Court's treatment of the common law. For better or worse, these
understandings of the Lochner era treat judicial activism as a secondary
concern. The central problem of the Lochner Court had to do with its
conceptions of neutrality and inaction and its choice of appropriate
baseline.</p>

        <title>II. LOCHNER AND CURRENT CONSTITUTIONAL LAW</title>
        <p>This understanding of Lochner is hardly uncontroversial, but
variants have been offered. 5 1 And ifLochner is understood in these terms, it
has not been entirely overruled. Numerous decisions, in widely
disparate areas of constitutional law, depend on Lochner-like baselines and
similar principles of neutrality and inaction; one or more of the
understandings of Lochner set above are reflected in many areas of current
law. The areas to be covered span a wide range, including affirmative
action, campaign finance regulation, gender discrimination, the state
action doctrine, the distinction between de facto and de jure
discrimination, and judicial review of inaction by federal administrative
agencies. The discussion begins with areas using common law baselines and
later shifts to areas in which the status quo is the foundation for
decision.</p>
        <p>It is important to understand that for present purposes, the goal is
descriptive rather than normative. To say that a decision depends on
Lochner-like premises is not to say that it was wrong. The normative

            A question arises here about the criteria for deciding when a particular
understanding of the Lochner era, or of any other period, ought to be accepted. Of course the
primary requirement is that the understanding be true to the decided cases-certainly in
terms of result, and, it is to be hoped, in terms of the rhetoric as well. But among
conflicting understandings that fit the cases equally well, the choice has an inescapable
normative dimension. R. Dworkin, Law's Empire 90-98 (

posed a ceiling on campaign expenditures by candidates and political
parties. In defense of the regulation, the government argued that it
sought to equalize the relative ability of individuals and groups to
influence the outcomes of elections. Disparities in wealth, the government
claimed, enabled some to drown out the voices of others. Restrictions
on the speech of the wealthy served the interest of "dissemination of
information from 'diverse and antagonistic sources.' -53 By equalizing
participation in the political realm, campaign finance regulation, it was
said, did not undermine but instead promoted first amendment
interests.</p>
          <p>In Buckley, the Court concluded that this justification for regulation
was illegitimate. In the Court's words, "the concept that government
may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to
enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First
Amendment."'5 4 The effort at equalization was not within the
permissible ends of government. As far as the first amendment is concerned,
the state must take disparities in wealth, and the existence of some with
more "voice" than others, as part of nature for which government
bears no responsibility. To do otherwise was, for the Buckley Court, a
kind of first amendment "taking."</p>
          <p>Buckley is a direct heir to Lochner. In both cases, the existing
distribution of wealth is seen as natural, and failure to act is treated as no
decision at all. Neutrality is inaction, reflected in a refusal to intervene
in markets or to alter the existing distribution of wealth. Buckley, like
Lochner, grew out of an understanding that for constitutional purposes,
the existing distribution of wealth must be taken as simply "there," and
that efforts to change that distribution are impermissible. Under both
cases, the category of permissible legislative ends was sharply limited.
To be sure, Buckley was a construction of the first amendment, whereas
Lochner rested on the due process clause; and that distinction may turn
out to be important. 55 But whether or not Buckley was rightly decided,
it has much in common with Lochner.</p>

        <sec id="sec-3-1-2">
          <title>Defining Liberty and Property</title>
          <p>The due process clause accords procedural protection to "liberty"
and "property," terms that the Court has had some difficulty defining
in recent years. 56 The principal problems have arisen in deciding
which, if any, statutory benefits-those said to be "conferred by the
1987]
goverment"-are entitled to procedural protection. 5 7 For a long
period the Court concluded that some benefits were "created" by the
government, whereas other benefits were not. Only the latter-generally
interests protected by the common law-were entitled to procedural
protection. In the wake of an assault on this position, rejecting
Lochnerlike baselines deriving from common law,58 the Court has apparently
concluded that statutory benefits will sometimes be considered
"liberty" or "property"- but only when there is a statutory entitlement,
defined as a limitation on the administrator's discretion to provide the
benefit in question. 59</p>
          <p>Lochner-like premises powerfully influence this debate. For the
most part, liberty and property are defined by reference to the common
law.60 Interests protected at common law-including most
prominently the right to private property, the right to bodily integrity, and
other rights protected in the Lochner era-are axiomatically entitled to
protection. The difficulties arise with other sorts of rights, including
the right to freedom from discrimination, the right to government
employment, and the right to welfare. The statutory entitlement approach
is based on a partial rejection of Lochner-era understandings. But the
Court's failure to put benefits said to be created by the government on
the same footing with benefits said to be "natural" is a clear holdover
from the Lochner period. The distinction itself treats the common law as
unchosen and statutory benefits as a form of "intervention"-the same
choice of baseline that affected the Lochner Court. An alternative
approach would have been to select liberty and property interests by
reference to some criterion of importance independent of the common
law, or at least not determined by common law categories. 6 1
Similar issues have arisen as a matter of substantive due process.
In Flemmingv. Nestor,6 2 the Court concluded that social security benefits
were not constitutionally protected "property. ' 6 3 The same conclusion
has been reached elsewhere, as courts have concluded that government
may eliminate benefits of its own creation-where that notion is defined
by reference to the common law.64 The failure to accord substantive
protection to statutory benefits derives from Lochner era distinctions
between common law interests and other benefits. Similarly, the
constraints of Article III have been administered under Lochner-like
premises. The Court is less likely to require an Article III tribunal
when a right created by Congress is at stake. The common law thus
defines a large amount of the territory captured by Article III
requirements.6 5</p>

        <sec id="sec-3-1-3">
          <title>C. State Action</title>
          <p>The state action doctrine is a product of an (uncontroversial)
understanding that the Constitution is directed to acts of government
rather than acts of private individuals. But how does one decide
whether government is "acting"? The legal test could in theory
depend on whether government agents are involved in the process. But
as the dispute provoked by such cases as Shelley v. Kraemer6 6 makes
clear, such a test would be inadequate. State officials are involved in
the enforcement of private contract, tort, and property law every day,
and their involvement does not subject all private arrangements to
constitutional constraints. Instead, state action doctrine has always
depended on a baseline establishing the legitimate or at least ordinary
functions of government. And in setting forth such a theory, and using
it as the basis of inquiry, courts have not merely searched for state
"action," but instead relied on common law baselines like those in Lochner.</p>
          <p>For example, the Constitution is frequently said to be a charter of
"negative" rather than "positive" rights. 67 This understanding can be
found in a number of areas of state action doctrine. When the
government fails to provide protection against private racial discrimination,
the failure is said not to be "state action" and thus raises no
constitutional question. 68 Nongovernmental discrimination is created by the
private rather than the public sphere. So too, no constitutional
ques1987]
tion is raised when private property owners deny the public access to
their property. As the Court held in Hudgens v. NLRB, 69 the first
amendment is not violated when landowners invoke state trespass law
in order to prevent picketers from displaying their messages on private
lands. All of these issues are resolved by the choice of a Lochner-like
baseline of government "inaction," one that appears neutral and
natural. Neither enforcement of the trespass law nor repeal of laws
forbidding private discrimination is taken as state action-a conclusion that
relies upon common law notions about the role of government.</p>
          <p>But consider PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins.70 That case
involved a decision by the California Supreme Court extending rights of
free speech, under the state constitution, so as to permit people to
picket on privately owned shopping centers. The shopping center
owners invoked the due process and takings clauses as a bar to the
abrogation of their property rights, as those rights had been understood
before the California court's decision. The Supreme Court upheld the
abrogation, but left no doubt that the partial abrogation of the state law
of trespass was "state action" sufficient to call for constitutional
scrutiny. Indeed, a fair reading of the opinion is that some abrogations of
state trespass law would amount to an unconstitutional taking-a
conclusion that should be unexceptionable. Property rights are defined by
state law. Abrogation of trespass law, either with respect to particular
persons or across-the-board, is ordinarily the central meaning of a
taking of property.</p>
          <p>Why did the abrogation of trespass law in PruneYard appear
uncontroversially to be state action, while application of the same law was
understood to be no such thing in Hudgens? Indeed, which case
involved "action," and which "inaction"? At first glance, the invocation
of a trespass law might seem more plausibly to be action than the
abrogation or removal of the very same law. The cases confirm that the
state action inquiry is not a search for whether the state has "acted,"
but instead an examination of whether it has deviated from functions
that are perceived as normal and desirable. And that examination is
powerfully influenced by the common law; thus it is the abrogation
rather than the enforcement of a trespass law that appears to be state
action. The baseline, in short, has been defined in terms that are
reminiscent of that in Lochner.</p>
          <p>It will be useful to return to the treatment of private racial
discrimination. There is general agreement, at least in the courts, 71 that no
constitutional question is raised if a state fails to provide protection

from private racial discrimination, or if a state repeals a statute that had
provided such protection. This understanding is made explicit in one
of the most vexing of modem state action cases, Reitman v. Mulkey. 72 At
issue in Reitman was a California constitutional amendment providing
that no state statute may be enacted that interferes with the private
right to sell property to whomever the property owner chooses. By a
five-to-four vote, the Court invalidated the amendment on the ground
that its purpose and effect were to encourage private racial
discrimination. But the Court was careful to emphasize that the amendment
stood on a very different footing from a "mere" failure to provide
protection against private racial discrimination. 73 For purposes of the
Constitution, PruneYard appeared an easy case, and the failure to
provide protection against trespass was obviously state action; whereas
Reitman was quite difficult, and the failure to provide protection against
racial discrimination was obviously not state action. What accounts for
this?</p>
          <p>The answer lies in the fact that the search for state action can be
made coherent only against a background normative theory of the
legitimate or normal activities of government. Without such a theory, the
search is unguided. It is only because of the persistence of Lochner-like
theory that state action was uncontroversially at stake in PruneYard but
difficult to find in Reitman v. Mulkey. 74 In PruneYard, there was a
deviation from the common law baseline. In a case in which the state fails to
provide protection against racial discrimination, or enforces the law of
trespass, there is not. In state action doctrine, as in the Lochner period,
the common law provides the benchmark from which to measure
intervention.</p>

        <sec id="sec-3-1-4">
          <title>D. Affirmative Rights: Of Welfare and Others</title>
          <p>For the last two decades there has been considerable debate about
the existence of affirmative rights against government. 75 The
conventional wisdom, 76 referred to above, has it that the Constitution is a
charter of negative guarantees-rights against government
interference-and that "affirmative" rights are exceptional or nonexistent.
Thus it is said that government may not intrude on private rights, but
there is no claim against the government if it has failed to act. The
basic position has resulted in rejection of claims to various public
serv1987]
ices, ranging from police protection to welfare. Perhaps the most
wellknown example is Harrisv. McRae,77 in which the plaintiffs challenged
the government's failure to fund abortions needed by poor women.
The Court held that government had no duty to remove barriers "not
of its own creation."' 78 The idea is that poverty is simply "there"; it is
not a product of government action. By now it should be easy to see
that this idea depends on Lochner-like definitions of neutrality, inaction,
and appropriate baselines.</p>
          <p>There is, however, a peculiarity in the notion that the Constitution
does not guarantee "affirmative rights." We have seen that the takings
clause protects against repeals, partial or total, of the trespass laws.
When a state abrogates the law of trespass, it is removing what might
be seen as "affirmative" protection; but its action does not become for
that reason constitutionally acceptable. The protection of private
contracts can be understood in similar terms. The contracts clause
amounts to a right to state enforcement of contractual agreements; if
the state fails to protect by refusing to enforce a contract, it is violating
the clause.</p>
          <p>Here and elsewhere, it is misleading to understand the
Constitution solely as a guarantor of "negative" rights. The Constitution
protects some rights and not others. Whether rights are treated as
"negative" or "positive" turns out to depend on antecedent
assumptions about baselines-the natural or desirable functions of
government. State protection of private property and contract appears to be a
"negative" guarantee because it is so usual, indeed built into the very
concepts of property and contract. 79 Provision of welfare is treated
differently because it is in some respects new and in any event hedged
with limitations and reservations. Here Lochner's premises, having to
do with neutrality and inaction, account critically for current
constitutional doctrine with respect to "affirmative" rights.</p>
          <p>All this sheds some light on claims of a constitutional right to
"affirmative" protection. Viewed through the lens of the Lochner period,
claims for "positive rights" cannot be dismissed by reference to the
"negative" character of constitutional guarantees or the word
"deprive" in the fourteenth amendment. Whether there is a deprivation
depends on antecedent conceptions of entitlement; if there were a
preexisting right to welfare, the failure to provide it would in fact be a
deprivation. In these circumstances one might argue that there have
always been constitutional rights to certain kinds of positive
guarantees, and that in the modern era the right to a minimal level of material
goods, like the right to protection against trespass, has constitutional
status. In mature form, this argument would be quite elaborate, and

for present purposes it is unnecessary to say whether the argument
might be made persuasive.8 0 It should suffice to suggest that cases
rejecting so-called "affirmative" rights depend on Lochner-like premises.</p>

        <sec id="sec-3-1-5">
          <title>E. Takings and ContractualImpairments</title>
          <p>The most conspicuously Lochner-like provisions in the Constitution
are the contracts and takings clauses, especially in their incorporation
of the status quo and of common law principles. The takings clause,
protecting private property, provides the analytical foundations for
Lochner itself. And it is hard to read the provision without accepting, at
least to some degree, certain premises about neutrality, inaction, and
common law baselines. The contracts clause protects a species of
private property; it thus grows out of the same framework as Lochner. But
in the last fifty years, the constraints of the contracts and takings clauses
have been significantly curtailed, in part for the same reasons that led
to the abandonment of Lochner itself. These developments suggest,
among other things, that text and animating purposes have been far
from central to decisions about whether to rely on Lochner-like
principles.</p>
          <p>The decline of the contracts clause has been a subject of increasing
modern controversy. The clause provides that no state shall enact any
law "impairing the obligations of contracts." For a long period the
clause operated as a significant barrier to government action; the clause
is now for the most part8 l a dead letter. How might this development
be explained?</p>
          <p>The answer lies in the dramatic expansion of the police power-in
short, from an understanding based on Lochner to one rooted in West
Coast Hotel. For a long period the contracts clause has permitted states
to abrogate contracts so long as they are operating within the "police
power." If a state bans the sale of heroin, and the ban applies
retroactively to prevent enforcement of a contract, there is no constitutional
problem.8 2 The reserved powers of the state, it is said, operate as an
implicit limitation on the power to contract. But if the police power is
understood in Lochner-like terms, there is still enormous room for
immunity from legislative interference-a claim demonstrated by the
interpretation of the contracts clause for much of the nation's history.8 3</p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>In Home Building Loan Association v. Blaisdell,84 however, the Court read</title>
      <p>the police power very broadlyv-thus replicating the outcome in West
Coast Hotel and rendering the contracts clause functionally identical to
the due process clause.</p>
      <p>Similar developments occurred under the law of eminent domain.
Here Lochner-like premises might be expected in two places: the
interpretation of the "public use" requirement and of the police power
exception to the compensation requirement. The public use requirement
traditionally meant that the property had actually to be used by the
public.8 5 But gradually the requirement was expanded to refer to any
plausible public justification, including those that are redistributive in
character.8 6 Thus it is said that the public use requirement has been
rendered effectively unenforceable, much like the rationality
requirement of the due process clause post-Lochner.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the police power exception to the eminent domain
clause immunizes various regulatory measures from constitutional
attack, even if they diminish the value of property. An actual physical
invasion of property is often a prerequisite for a finding of a "taking." 8 7
All this is a product of an abandonment of Lochner-like baselines. It
would be difficult, however, to abandon those baselines altogether
without reading the contracts and takings clauses out of the
Constitution; in nature, those provisions are Lochner-like, though their scope is
uncertain.8 8 The narrowing of the scope of the contracts clause has
almost converted it into a constitutional redundancy; the takings clause
is still important in the context of physical invasions.</p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>F. JudicialReview ofAgency Inaction</title>
        <p>One of the most important issues in modern administrative law is
whether inaction by administrative agencies, defined as the failure to
enforce regulatory statutes, should be subject to the same standards as
administrative action, defined as regulatory enforcement. Under the
traditional approach, agency action is subject to a strong presumption

        <p>3. Dejure/defacto. - For a long period it was unclear whether de
facto segregation was a cause for constitutional concern.1 20 De facto
segregation, largely in the North, is said to arise from the voluntary
choices of blacks and whites; de jure segregation is the product of law.
But here, as in the case of affirmative action, the terminology itself rests
on Lochner-like premises. The notion of de facto segregation suggests
that segregation simply happened; it is "just there." But if the
existence of patterns of segregation were seen as an outgrowth of the legacy
of racial discrimination, an attack on "de facto" segregation might have
been more plausible. There may be good reasons to immunize some
kinds of segregation from legal control, but the doctrinal distinction
depends partly on understandings of neutrality and inaction that are
close cousins of Lochner.</p>

        <title>I. Gender Discrimination</title>
        <p>In the last two decades, the Court has given "heightened scrutiny"
to discrimination against women, invalidating a wide range of statutes.
Sometimes the Court invalidates statutes because they are based on
inaccurate stereotypes. 1 2 ' But the difficult cases arise when the Court
faces measures reflecting differences that are in some sense real.
Consider, for example, Califano v. Goldfarb,122 involving a statute allowing
spouses of men automatically to qualify for social security benefits, but
requiring spouses of women to establish dependency; Craigv. Boren,1 23
invalidating a law prohibiting boys from drinking alcoholic beverages
until age twenty-one, but allowing girls to drink at age eighteen;
Mississippi Universityfor Women v. Hogan,124 involving a nursing school limited
to women; and Rostker v. Goldberg,125 upholding a law requiring men but
not women to register for the military draft. In all of these cases, the
statute under attack responded, albeit sometimes crudely, to
differences between men and women that were in some sense real. On what
basis did the Court invalidate the first three measures?</p>
        <p>
          A clue can be found in Craigv. Boren, where the Court, responding
to statistics showing that boys tended to be cited for drunk driving
more often than girls, said that statistical demonstrations are
"intension with the normative philosophy that underlies the Equal Protection

Clause."1 26 In all of these cases, the differences, even if "real," are not
simply there, but are at least to some degree' 27 artifactual: a product of
cultural forces, including the legal system, that have created and
perpetuated differences between the sexes. Thus in Goldfarb, the fact that
men tend to be wage-earners more often than women was not treated
as exogenous to the legal system. Indeed, the fact was reinforced as
such, even if in a minimal way, by the very statute in Goldfarb, which
made the package of benefits more attractive for men than for women
and tended to make it more desirable for men to work. Thus in the
Hogan case, the Court said that the statute at issue "makes the
assumption that nursing is a field for women a self-fulfilling prophecy."' 128</p>
        <p>Rostker is a striking contrast. There the Court reasoned that since
Congress had excluded women from combat, the difference in
registration requirements responded to "real differences" between men and
women. But those real differences were a product of law; it was a
statute that created them. Rostker is in this sense reminiscent of a wide
range of earlier cases failing to recognize the constructed character of
gender distinctions and upholding discrimination because of a
perception that subordination of women was a part of nature. 129</p>
        <p>With the exception of Rostker, the cases under discussion derive
from a partial rejection ofLochner-like principles that would take gender
differences as exogenous variables, and would understand neutrality to
lie in reasonable responses to those differences. 130 To this extent, the

        <p>127. Two qualifications are necessary here. First, it is not necessary to ask to what
degree gender differences have a biological component. Even if there is such a
component, it hardly justifies the measures at issue in most cases; it is by no means clear that
the legal system should turn biological differences into social disadvantages. The point
here is that Lochner-like reasoning would take gender differences as a proper basis for
legal differentiation, no matter their source, and that some of the current law of gender
discrimination is opposed to such reasoning. Cf. C. MacKinnon, Feminism Unmodified
(1987) (discussing ways in which legal system naturalizes discrimination against women).</p>
        <p>The second problem lies in deciding when something is artifactual or not. A strong
view of the lesson of the Lochner period is that everything is-precisely because
government decisions not to change matters are, after all, decisions. In this view, qualifications
of the sort in the text-suggesting that gender differences, poverty, and the distribution
of benefits and burdens along racial lines are "partly" a product ofthe legal system-are
unnecessary and misleading. Such qualifications themselves import Lochner-like
premises.</p>

prejudice is "the lens that distorts reality," an understanding that depends on the
premise that there is a prepolitical reality that law should reflect. See C. MacKinnon,
Feminism Unmodified 40-42 (1987).</p>

law of gender discrimination is an outgrowth of ideas that abandon the
status quo as a neutral baseline and instead rely on a baseline of gender
equality operating to some extent as a criticism of the existing order.
But many areas of the law of gender discrimination share Lochner-like
premises. Consider, in addition to the Rostker decision, cases finding
discriminatory effects insufficient for constitutional invalidation;' 3 1
decisions permitting employers to exclude fertile women from
employment when actual or potential fetuses may be endangered;13 2 and
Michael M. v. Sonoma County Superior Court,133 upholding distinctions in
age for statutory rape. Above all, cases involving discrimination on the
basis of actual or potential pregnancy, or control of reproductive
functions, are Lochner-like to the extent that they turn differences that are
often regarded as natural into legal disadvantages.' 3 4 In this sense, Roe
v. Wade itself might be seen as profoundly anti-Lochnerinsofar as it
accorded to women the power to make a decision that it had been
previously thought was not theirs because of nature.1 3 5
        </p>
        <p>To say that such cases treat gender differences as real, when the
social and legal meaning of those differences is a decision of the legal
system, is not necessarily to say that they were wrongly decided.13 6 But
it is to suggest that they depend on Lochner-like premises about
neutrality.</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>J. Preferences and the Law</title>
      <p>Both public and private law generally take private preferences as
the appropriate basis for social choice. In private law, paternalism
tends to be disfavored,' 3 7 and the most well-known conceptions of
public law understand the purpose of legislation to be the aggregation</p>
      <p>1987]
of private preferences.' 3 8 To this degree, preferences are treated in
Lochner-like fashion as exogenous variables; and legal interferences with
those preferences are generally thought to be partisan and illegitimate.
The processes of preference formation and the-possibility of distorting
factors are generally not a subject for legal inquiry. 13 9</p>
      <p>Sometimes, however, constitutional courts conclude that
preferences are a product of some kind of distortion. Consider, for example,
the constitutional hostility to freedom-of-choice plans as a remedy for
school segregation. 140 At first glance it is hard to see why such plans
should be objectionable, for they allow blacks and whites to send their
children to whatever schools they prefer. If the result is continuing
segregation, the problem might be thought to lie in private choices
rather than in the legal system.</p>
      <p>The Court's hostility to such plans depends at least in part on a
conclusion that the preferences of whites and blacks are distorted by
the history of discrimination. 14 Blacks may prefer not to send their
children to predominantly white schools because of a fear of racial
hostility and antagonism. Whites may be reluctant to send their children to
black schools because of racial prejudice brought about at least in part
through law. In these circumstances, the preferences are not simply
"there" and to be taken as natural; they are a result of legal structures,
and remedial measures must take that into account.</p>
      <p>A similar issue is raised by Palmore v. Sidoti,14 2 in which the Court
invalidated a child custody plan giving preferences to parents of the
same race as the child. The Court said that the state may not sanction
racial prejudice through law, but it is unclear why the Constitution
should forbid government from taking into account the reality of
private racism. Here too the answer depends on a perception that racism
is not simply exogenous; it is a product of public and private choices
and is properly subject to legal remedy. The same considerations apply
in the area of gender. What emerges is therefore a system that
generally treats preferences as exogenous and a proper basis for social
choice, but that in certain limited contexts 143 concludes that
preferences reflect relations of power brought about by, among other things,
the legal system itself.</p>
      <p>III. ABANDONING LOCHNER</p>
      <p>We have seen that Lochner has many progeny in modern
constitutional law.' 4 4 Sometimes, as in Buckley and Wygant, Lochner-like
premises are used as a basis for invalidating government measures.</p>
      <sec id="sec-5-1">
        <title>Sometimes, as in Harrisv. McRae and Washington v. Davis, premises of</title>
        <p>that sort are used in order to uphold such measures. Nor is the
problem limited to constitutional provisions protecting individual rights.
The structural provisions of the Constitution were designed partly to
protect private property and liberty from government incursion. 14 5
The rise of the modem administrative state is based largely on a
perception that aggressive governmental action, repudiating the common
law, has become necessary. 14 6 One of the most important tasks of
modem constitutional theory is to implement the original purposes of
the structural provisions in a time when traditional conceptions of
limited government have been repudiated. 14 7</p>
        <p>
          The claim that there is in many areas of current public law an
analytic connection to Lochner is only descriptive, and it does not
necessar143. The limitation derives from a fear that if the legal system is generally
permitted to intervene whenever preferences are "distorted," lines will become difficult or
impossible to draw and the range of permissible interventions will be limitless. See
Sunstein, supra note 139, at 1169-73, for general discussion; on the related problem of
"false consciousness," see also J. Elster, Making Sense of Marx (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">1984</xref>
          ).
        </p>
        <p>
          144. The issue arises in private law as well. One might, for example, understand
the Coase theorem as above all a rejection ofLochner-like approaches to such concepts as
causation, action, and inaction. Cf. B. Ackerman, Reconstructing American Law 46-71
(
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">1984</xref>
          ) (discussing effect of Coase theorem on the way lawyers structure the facts).
Much private law theory in the past two decades has attempted to come to terms with
the destabilizing effect of the Coase theorem-just as public law theory has had to face
the confusions produced by abandonment of common law baselines.

          Statutory interpretation is affected by Lochner-like premises as well-most familiarly
in the notion that "statutes in derogation of the common law should be narrowly
construed," but in more modern approaches as well. See, e.g., Easterbrook, Statutes'
Domains, 50 U. Chi. L. Rev. 533 (1983), which amounts to an argument that when there are
statutory "gaps," courts should resolve all doubts in favor of market ordering. See also
Macey, Promoting Public-Regarding Legislation Through Statutory Interpretation: An
Interest Group Model, 86 Colum. L. Rev. 223 (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">1986</xref>
          ) (defining factional tyranny in part
by reference to departures from the common law). An important task is to develop
1987]
ily argue for doctrinal change. Indeed, it would be difficult to imagine a
constitutional system that did not have some premises in common with
Lochner. The framers themselves shared those premises, and versions
can be found at every stage of American constitutionalism. But the
argument for Lochner-like premises is conceptual as well as historical. It is
hard to escape Lochner in thinking about this or any other legal system;
its premises are built into our language itself.148 Without some
foundations or baselines from which to make measurements, legal analysis
cannot go forward, and in some cases it is hard to dispute that
understandings like those reflected in the common law or the status quo are
the appropriate baseline. The point is buttressed by the fact that in any
legal system, one should hope for some degree of continuity over time.
The current system owes its foundations to the common law. It would
be most surprising, and probably undesirable, to find those
foundations entirely abandoned.' 4 9
        </p>
        <p>But Lochner was wrongly decided, and one of the reasons that it was
wrong is that it depended on baselines and consequent understandings
of action and neutrality that were inappropriate for constitutional
analysis. The New Deal to a large degree rejected those understandings,
and the rejection has only partly found its way into law. Which, if any,
of current doctrines should be abandoned for the same reason? How
should constitutional law proceed if it is to escape its roots in
Lochnerlike reasoning? It is difficult to answer these questions in the abstract;
whether and how Lochner-like premises should be rejected is too large a
question to discuss as a whole. This section ventures some thoughts on
the relevant inquiries.</p>

        <title>A. Naturalness and the Problem of Baseline</title>
        <p>The Lochner Court chose the status quo, as reflected in market
ordering under the common law system, as the baseline for measurement
of departures from neutrality and of action and inaction. There are
approaches to statutory construction that are not based on hostility to departures from
common law categories.</p>
        <p>The same view is reflected in approaches to administrative law that distinguish
between the rights of statutory beneficiaries and those of regulated class members. See
Scalia, Vermont Yankee: The APA, the D.C. Circuit, and the Supreme Court, 1978 Sup.
Ct. Rev. 345 (suggesting that ordinary concerns supporting procedural safeguards do
not apply when statutory beneficiaries are the complainants); Smith, Judicialization: The

often good reasons to abandon that baseline, at least as a general
rule.15 0 The common law is not prepolitical; its conception of the
function of the state has been repudiated by the political branches of
government, and for good reasons. Constitutional and statutory
interpretation is properly informed by this repudiation.15 1 Efforts to
change the common law framework are not by virtue of the fact
constitutionally suspect, and measures that respect that framework are not
"inaction" necessarily to be immunized from legal scrutiny. Use of the
status quo as a baseline is.sometimes objectionable for similar reasons.
Consider the fact that discrimination on the basis of race is responsible
for the existing distribution of benefits and burdens along racial lines.
        </p>
        <p>If the baseline provided by the common law or the status quo is
abandoned, there are two principal alternatives. One possible response
to the decline ofLochner would be to conclude that constitutional courts
ought to play little or no role in deciding whether the existing
distribution of wealth and entitlements should be changed. Associated with
one strand in the New Deal but presaged by Holmes' Lochner opinion,
this view appears prominently in Learned Hand's lectures on the Bill of
Rights, 152 James Landis' work on administrative law, 153 and the
opinions of Justice Frankfurter.' 5 4</p>
        <p>Under the Holmesian view it does not matter, for constitutional
purposes, whether the state is reaffirming or rejecting the common law,
or whether it is dramatically changing the existing allocation of
entitlements and power. The abandonment of common law baselines
requires an abandonment of baselines altogether, at least for purposes of
constitutional law. Neutrality is not required because it cannot be
achieved; all legal categories are socially constructed and irreducibly
subjective.' 5 5 Such an approach would mean that the basic terms of
social life are for political rather than legal determination.' 56</p>
        <p>Sometimes this view is founded on interest-group pluralism;'5 7
sometimes it is derived from skepticism about the notion of
objectivity 5 8s and about distinctions between reason and power.15 9 For those
who believe in interest-group pluralism, efforts to ensure neutrality, in
the form of public-regarding legislation, ignore the inevitably
self-interested character of political behavior. Neutrality, however understood,
is thus inconsistent with the very nature of politics. 1 60 The conclusion
is that baselines should be rejected for purposes of constitutional law;
courts should uphold legislation except in the most extreme cases. For
those skeptical about objectivity, neutrality is an unacceptable effort to
privilege a position that is itself contingent and likely to reflect some
kind of social interest. 16 1 At its most general level, this concern is
reflected in a wide range of work questioning the legacy of the
Enlightenment.16 2 This position offers obscure guidance for constitutional
courts; it counsels a general rejection both of neutrality and of
baselines, but at least in some forms, it offers no alternative position from
which to decide cases.</p>
        <p>Approaches that follow Holmes and abandon baselines for the
purposes of constitutional law, like the approach in Lochner, have the
advantage of easy administration; they are reflected in some of current
law under the contracts, due process, and takings clauses; and they can
claim as well a proper appreciation of democratic values. 163 The
Holmesian abandonment of baselines is of course reflected in
traditional understandings of the lesson of the Lochner period. The decision
whether to accept those understandings is inescapably normative, and
the traditional view might be defended on the foregoing grounds.</p>
        <p>In so extreme a form, however, this position is unacceptable
precisely because it is based on odd understandings of republicanism 16 4
and of the workings of majoritarianism.165 The Holmesian position
would result in a failure to enforce many constitutional provisions that
invite judicial use of baselines, sometimes deriving from the common
law, and that are self-conscious limits on the ability of government to
restructure or to fail to restructure the existing order. Consider the
first amendment, the takings clause, the equal protection clause, and
the contracts clause, all of which impose limits on governmental power.
Moreover, neutrality- understood not as preservation of market
ordering or as disregard of past discrimination but as a requirement of a
public-regarding justification for legislation-continues to be required,
and for good reasons. 166 The Holmesian position, reflected in some
traditional thinking about Lochner, would amount to an abandonment of
constitutionalism altogether. Its crude and conclusory references to
the primacy of electoral politics are insufficient to support that
abandonment. 167</p>
        <p>
          A third approach would avoid the difficulties associated with both
Lochner and the Holmesian alternative, but it would carry with it large
164. Consider, for example, the interpretation of Madison in Bork, supra note 7, at
2-3, suggesting that in a Madisonian system majorities are allowed to rule in some areas
of life "for no better reason than that they are majorities." Compare the interpretation
in D. Epstein, The Political Theory of The Federalist 178 (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">1984</xref>
          ) (suggesting that the
system was intended to ensure a large measure of deliberation on the part of national
representatives).
        </p>
        <p>
          165. Some of the problems here include the difficulties, stressed in public choice
theory, in aggregating private preferences through majority rule. See, e.g., W. Riker,
Liberalism vs. Populism: A Confrontation Between the Theory of Democracy and the
Theory of Social Choice (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref82">1982</xref>
          ). Moreover, for various reasons some preferences
should not be counted, see Goodin, Laundering Preferences, in Foundations of Social
Choice Theory (J. Elster &amp; A. Hylland eds. 1986). Consider also the slippage between
constituent pressures and legislative outcomes, and the various obstacles, captured in
the collective action problem, to accurate preference-aggregation through
majoritarianism, see R. Hardin, Collective Action (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref82">1982</xref>
          ). On these various questions, see generally

Democracy (J. Elster &amp; R. Slagstaad eds. forthcoming 1988).
        </p>

          166. That requirement has a disciplining effect, albeit a weak one, on the sorts of
measures that can be proposed and enacted, and also tends to transform the nature of
political discourse in desirable ways. See Goodin, Laundering Preferences, in
Foundations of Social Choice Theory (J. Elster &amp; A. Hylland eds. 1986); Sunstein, Interest
Groups in American Public Law, 38 Stan. L. Rev. 29 (

          ). In the area ofjudicial
decision, the requirement of neutrality-in the form of an effort to justify differential
treatment-remains important, see R. Dworkin, supra note 51 at 176-224; Greenawalt,
supra note 11I, at 989, 992. That requirement is the judicial analogue of the
requirement of public-regardingness imposed on legislators, and in neither context should it be
confused by importation of Lochner-like premises.

problems of its own. That approach would attempt to generate a
baseline independent of either the common law or the status quo through
some theory ofjustice, to be derived from the language and animating
purposes of the text and based to a greater or lesser degree on existing
interpretations. Such an endeavor would require a theory of
interpretation, a theory of institutional role, and a theory ofjustice. The effort
would be the legal analogue to the various efforts in modem political
theory to go beyond or replace classically liberal social contract
theories. 168 The text would be the foundation for a theory169 that would be
independent of common law ordering, or the status quo, and would
serve as a basis for evaluating it. Approaches of this sort might treat
the Constitution as a unit, reflecting a single overarching theory. For
reasons explored below, it would be preferable to proceed
provisionby-provision, 170 constructing theories for each constitutional clause
and allowing considerable variation among them. Helpful guidance
can be found in republican theories of politics, which carry with them
substantive constraints 17 1 and whose premises are highly congenial to
ralist fashion, does not capture the view of the framers and is not likely to provide
desirable outcomes).</p>
        <p>A closely related approach would attempt to cabin judicial discretion by referring to
the intent of the framers, the text of the Constitution, or some other limitation on
judicial discretion. Such an approach would reflect a belief that because of the problems
posed by democratic theory for an aggressive judicial role, constitutional courts ought
not to rely on principles of distributive justice at all. See Monaghan, supra note 7, at
374; Easterbrook, supra note 163, at 91, 97.</p>

deciding at what level of generality "intent" should be read; the problem of ascertaining
the framers' intentions with respect to interpretation; the various difficulties faced by
majoritarianism in aggregating private preferences; and the fact that it is by no means
self-evident that a well-functioning democracy merely reflects constituent preferences.
A final position on such matters is of course necessary in order to decide whether the
Holmesian understanding of the Lochner period should be accepted in favor of the
approach set out here.

the New Deal attack on the common law. 172 A profitable strategy
would be to avoid abstraction and to examine particular areas with
considerable care.1 73
        </p>
        <p>Such an approach would force courts to confront the question of
why and how the artifactual quality of a particular system is relevant to
the legal question. The fact that a practice is artifactual hardly means
that it should be changed; and the fact that it is in some sense natural is
not necessarily a reason to respect it.' 74 Consider here the area of
gender discrimination; it is the legal system that makes relevant any
biological difference, and a decision to turn a difference into a disadvantage
demands independent support. 75- But a finding that a practice or
system is a product of government is relevant in various respects. First, it
may suggest that changes should not be regarded as "takings"; the
notion of a taking depends on an antecedent baseline, and if the baseline
is not natural, one needs an independent reason to respect it.
Moreover, if a practice is revealed as simply an adaptation to the status quo,
new legal rules will not be futile. Finally, it is sometimes thought that
interferences with practices that are an outgrowth of nature infringe on
liberty or on some other right. The Lochner era is itself an example, and
the areas of race and gender discrimination might be similarly
understood. A recognition that the practices in question are artifactual may
weaken such objections. The fact that a practice is a creature of
government thus removes some arguments for retaining it, though
standing by itself, it is hardly a powerful reason to change it.</p>
        <p>Development of a theory of justice that interprets the
constitutional text but that is independent of the status quo is extremely
difficult. A strong version of anti-Lochner thinking would make it hard to
provide foundations from which to begin the inquiry; even theories of
distributive justice need to accept some grounds from which to
proceed. 176 Such theories must be culturally situated. The notion of a
foundational theory existing entirely apart from conventions is likely to
be chimerical, and in its own way reflective of Lochner-like premises. If
172. Republican approaches tend not to see rights as prepolitical; the Lochner
understanding of the common law can thus be criticized on republican grounds, and those
grounds tend to replicate the ideas described supra notes 7-8, 39-45 and accompanying
text.</p>
        <p>1987]
so, the task is instead to be critical of existing practices without
pretending to have transcended the particular culture altogether. 177</p>
        <p>One can point to some such efforts in current law. The first
amendment prohibitions of discrimination on the basis of point of view
and of government preference of particular religions are prominent
examples. 178 The law of racial discrimination is a particularly helpful
illustration here. Courts have developed theories that permit them to
evaluate particular social practices from an independent baseline, one
that prohibits intentional discrimination against blacks. Discrimination
on the basis of gender, alienage, and illegitimacy is handled in similar
terms. The principal effort here is to develop and justify an alternative
baseline, and to imagine a world in which the illegitimate or irrelevant
considerations were not at work.</p>
        <p>In some areas, this task appears easy, but the setting of school
segregation suggests why development of a baseline independent of the
status quo is sometimes difficult. For a long period, the controversial
questions here had to do with the constitutionality of freedom of choice
and other plans in attempting to eliminate the effects of segregation. 179
Freedom-of-choice plans do not significantly reduce segregation, but
court-ordered transportation plans, including racial percentages, can
hardly be said to be restoring the system to what it would be if
discrimination had never taken place. The problem here is to imagine a
hypothetical world in which housing patterns and educational choices were
unaffected by past discrimination. The search for a status quo ante in
the area of school segregation has an arbitrary quality, and sometimes
the Court has had to come close to requiring integration in the absence
of any other plausible version of a reconstructed system.' 8 0</p>
        <p>The problem is hardly limited to the area of school segregation. It
arises in many cases in which courts are asked to reject the status quo as
the appropriate baseline. Consider, for example, a decision to allow a
showing of discriminatory effects to trigger the equal protection clause.
To a greater or lesser degree, such a decision would require courts to
imagine what the system of benefits and burdens across the races would
look like in a world unaffected by a legacy of racism. Although
inquiries of this sort are familiar in some areas of the law, in the present
context they would be difficult to anchor; the causal links are so
complex that a reconstruction of the past would inevitably rest on uncertain
premises. 18 ' The area of gender discrimination poses similar
problems. Imagine efforts to see how veterans' preferences or abortion
would be treated in a world unaffected by sexism.18 2</p>
        <p>This is not the occasion to set out a general theory of appropriate
baselines from which to decide constitutional cases; as we will see, the
answer is likely to vary across provisions. It should suffice to suggest
that the common law or status quo baseline in Lochner will often be
unacceptable; that the existing order should not be regarded as natural
or inviolate; that the abandonment of baselines altogether is also
unacceptable; and that generation of an independent alternative is
sometimes necessary but poses large difficulties of its own. Current law is an
amalgam of all three approaches. The primary purpose here is to
suggest some of the ingredients in the decision why and when Lochner-like
premises should be abandoned.</p>
        <p>An important lesson of the discussion to follow is the need to
proceed with some particularity. Abstract or general approaches are
unlikely to be helpful here, at least for the foreseeable future.' 8 3 The
examination of particular areas is the starting point for extrapolating
more general principles.</p>

        <title>B. Swords and Shields</title>
        <p>Even if the Holmesian approach is rejected, a less extreme version
would suggest that in deciding whether Lochner-like premises should be
accepted, it is highly relevant whether the Court is permitting
government to act or prohibiting it from doing so. Courts might, in short, be
inclined to uphold measures defended in terms like those in West Coast
Hotel, even as they were disinclined to invalidate legislation under
premises derived from either Lochner or West Coast Hotel. Deference to
representative processes argues in favor of this result.' 8 4 Under this
view, the parallel of modem decisions to Lochner is closest when the

        <p>184. To some degree this position itself incorporates Lochner-like premises; it
distinguishes judicial action from inaction, and makes the distinction turn on whether the
Court is forcing dramatic changes in the status quo. Here, however, the inquiry
depends on institutional concerns having to do with the role of the judiciary.
Court is invalidating democratically-enacted legislation. Even if one
rejects the most extreme claims about the undemocratic character
ofjudicial review, one might agree that Lochner-like premises should rarely be
used to invalidate legislation.</p>
        <p>The argument for upholding the statute in Buckley v. Valeo was
therefore quite strong; the case was very close to Lochner itself-unless
there is some difference in the nature of the right, an issue taken up
below. Similarly, measures calling for "affirmative action," viewed
through the lens of the Lochner era, should generally not be thought to
raise a serious constitutional issue. When a legislature or other entity
enacts an affirmative action program, it should not be treated as
operating against a status quo baseline that is in some sense natural or
neutral. The current distribution of benefits and burdens along racial lines
is an outgrowth of a long history of discrimination. Efforts to eliminate
the subordination of blacks can hardly be regarded in the same way as
efforts to perpetuate it.185</p>
        <p>Similar considerations apply to redistributive measures enacted
under the constracts and taking clauses. Notwithstanding recent
criticism under Lochner-like premises, 186 current law under both clauses is
generally correct. It permits a wide realm of action for legislatures, an
appropriate conclusion in the face of textual ambiguity, the evident
desires of the majority, changed circumstances, and the growing scope
of the police power.' 87 In all of these contexts, an understanding like
that in West Coast Hotel should operate, at least prima facie, as a "shield"
against constitutional attacks on legislation, just as it does under the
due process clause in the aftermath of Lochner.</p>
        <p>Because of institutional concerns, more difficult questions are
raised by the prospect of using West Coast Hotel as a "sword," that is, as
the basis for constitutional attacks on existing social structures. In this
category can be put the various arguments for a discriminatory effects
test under the equal protection clause. So too, some of the arguments
in the racial and gender area attempt to use an understanding like that
in West CoastHotel as a sword against government. In the same category
can be placed the claims for welfare rights. In such cases, the fact that
the plaintiff is attacking legislation enacted by a popular majority
counts against recognition of the claim.' 88</p>
        <p>All this is hardly to suggest that the issue of swords and shields
should control the constitutional question; that would represent a
return to Holmesian understandings about thejudicial role and in its own
way reflect Lochner-like distinctions between action and inaction. 18 9 But
the issue is highly relevant. Constitutional law is often an uneasy
mixture of substantive theory and institutional constraint.1 90 The
existence of institutional limits on the part of the judiciary forces the courts
to limit the scope of substantive constraints on government action.
This combination sometimes produces doctrinal awkwardness, but it is
hard to think of an alternative. In these circumstances, it is important
whether a decision would call for simple validation of a measure
enacted by Congress or instead would require courts to undertake
significant social change on their own.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-5-4">
        <title>C. The Nature of the Clause</title>
        <p>The catalog of Lochner-like premises in modern public law spans a
wide range, and it implicates a large number of constitutional
provisions, including the contracts, takings, due process, and equal
protection clauses as well as the first amendment. But Lochner-like premises
are more necessary or appropriate under some provisions than under
others. A lawyer's natural reaction to the problem would be to
disentangle the various provisions. The interpretive process, informed to a
greater or lesser degree by the text and original purposes, might well
vary across clauses; different clauses may abandon or include
Lochnerlike premises. A theory of constitutional interpretation would of course
be necessary to accomplish this task.</p>
        <p>At the most general level, it is possible to understand the original
Constitution as having a substantial Lochner-like dimension. Both the
institutional and the individual rights provisions of the document were
influenced by an understanding of the naturalness of the distribution of
property. 19' The Civil War Amendments were at least a partial
recognition of the artifactual quality of existing distributions, and subsequent
judicial interpretation carried that recognition much further. The
various developments associated with the New Deal 192 were a substantial
abandonment of the Lochner-like features of constitutionalism, in its
institutional and individual rights dimensions. One of the most
important tasks of modern constitutional theory is to integrate these various
developments into a theory of constitutional interpretation.</p>
        <p>Lochner, under a textual approach, was wrong above all because it
was an interpretation of the due process clause. That clause may be

          ).
only procedural in character; 193 it may require the government only to
show some minimal justification for its decisions; it may not sharply
confine the permissible ends of the state. The takings clause, by
contrast, was built on a belief in the meaning and importance of private
property, and it would be difficult to read that clause in the fashion of
West Coast Hotel without reading it out of the Constitution. The same
conclusion may be appropriate under the contracts clause. At a
minimum, then, the takings and contracts clauses cannot easily be read -to
create a constitutional baseline other than that of the status quo; the
notion of property itself develops and evolves from common cultural
understandings that cannot easily be subject to independent judicial
reconstruction.' 94 The eminent domain and contracts clauses are most
naturally read to embody Lochner-like premises about neutrality and
inaction.
        </p>
        <p>At the same time, it would be possible to remove both provisions
from their foundations in Lochner. In particular, courts might recognize
the social construction of property and understand the term "takings"
against the backdrop set by independent theories of entitlement and an
appreciation of the social functions of private ownership. Such an
approach would produce difficult questions ofjudicial authority and
competence, but some have argued in favor of an effort of that sort.195 If
such an effort is to be made, however, it should proceed slowly and
incrementally in light of the history and current interpretation of the
clause.</p>
        <p>By contrast to the takings and contracts clauses, the equal
protection clause is most easily read as a self-conscious rejection of
Lochnerlike premises. The purpose of the clause was, at least to some degree,
to break up the system of subordination of blacks; the best
interpretation of the clause recognizes that the existing allocation of power
among the races is both artifactual and illegitimate, and its purpose is,
to a greater or lesser extent, to equalize that allocation. It should not
be surprising that insofar as understandings deriving from West Coast
Hotel have been used as a sword against government, the equal
protection clause has usually been the textual source of decision.

are most obviously their constitutional embodiment.
        </p>
        <p>What of the first amendment? In Buckley itself, the Court
suggested that the provision disposed of the issue: the constitutional
guarantee of freedom of speech prohibits the silencing of some in order to
promote the speech of others. But it is much too facile to point to the
text of the clause. Whether regulation of powerful private speakers
might sometimes promote "freedom of speech" is the question to be
decided. There was a powerful argument in Buckley that campaign
finance regulation was necessary in order to promote freedom of speech;
one could argue that such regulation was closer to being compelled
than proscribed.' 96 On the other hand, a wholesale abandonment of
Lochner-like premises, requiring courts to look at the content of speech,
would wreak havoc with existing first amendment doctrine-as it did
earlier in the century with private property under the due process
clause.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the central commitment of the first amendment, as
currently interpreted, is to neutrality on the basis of content or
viewpoint,197 and this commitment has a Lochner-like feature. Issues of
substantive power and powerlessness do not enter into the
constitutional inquiry. Government must be neutral between those viewpoints
that are good and bad, or those speakers that have power and those
that have none.1 98 A set of doctrines growing out of West Coast Hotel
would repudiate Buckley; efforts to redress the distorting effects of
financial contributions can be fit within the police power, especially in
light of theories of free speech that grow out of republican conceptions
of politics. 199 But doctrines based on West Coast Hotel might also be led
to reject the commitment to viewpoint neutrality. 200 Under such an
approach, redistributive and paternalistic goals would be permissible
under the first amendment. 201 The police power under the first
amendment would thus be close to the police power under the
fourteenth. Such an approach would permit government to impose a wide
range of regulatory restrictions, mostly on the speech of the powerful,
in the interest of reassessment of the existing distribution of power.</p>
        <p>
          There are reasons to be skeptical of so general an approach. The
problem of deciding who is powerful and who is not is too manipulable
and too likely to be skewed by impermissible factors to be the basis for

first amendment doctrine. Moreover, there are good reasons to
complain about restrictions on the speech of the powerful. Buckley itself was
wrongly decided; the principle at issue there might be confined to
financial expenditures without endangering the general principle of
viewpoint neutrality. 20 2 But it should not be surprising to find
Lochnerlike premises in first amendment doctrine.</p>
        <p>All this suggests that some constitutional provisions incorporate
Lochner-like premises, others reject them, and still others create difficult
interpretive problems. The nature of the provisions will thus be a
significant factor in deciding about appropriate baselines.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-5-5">
        <title>D. The Nature of the CausalLinks</title>
        <p>Another factor has to do with the reality or perception of a close
causal link between identifiable government action and the practice
under attack. In the context of welfare, the link between government
action and poverty may seem too attenuated to justify a claim of
causation; numerous other causal factors play a role. The same conclusion is
drawn in the context of de facto segregation. School and housing
patterns are affected by many factors, and the relevant legal rules were not
in force in the immediate past. The case of discriminatory effects may
be similarly understood, for the existence of such effects is the result of
a wide range of factors. Consider by contrast the courts' ready
acceptance of remedial plans for actual racial discrimination in the recent past
by the defendant. Here the link between state action and racially based
harm is so tight that causation is unquestionable. Judgments about
causation thus play a significant role in the cases.</p>
        <p>This concern, however, imports some Lochner-like premises about
action and inaction and is in any event secondary. In the cases under
consideration, there is almost always "but for" causation. The
causation issue produces difficulties when and because it is hard to imagine a
status quo ante. Consider, for example, a claim that de facto
segregation is unconstitutional, or even an attack on de jure segregation thirty
years ago. To imagine what the system would look like if the conduct
under attack had not occurred is necessarily speculative and largely
unanchored. This point presents the problem of baseline in another
form.</p>

      <sec id="sec-5-6">
        <title>E. The Consequences: Utilitarianand Other Losses</title>
        <p>Judgments about caustion are not based solely on a reconstruction
-ofhistory.203 Sometimes the decision is affected by the perceived
consequences of finding a causal link. Consider, for example, recognition
of a constitutional right to welfare. It may be conceded here that

          ).
erty is in some sense a creation of the state. But if it were to follow that
welfare was constitutionally guaranteed, the result may be to
undermine incentives for productive labor. Another example has to do with
discriminatory effects. If such effects were sufficient to produce
invalidity, the consequences would be enormous. Affirmative action would be
constitutionally mandated. Such a step would impose a severe strain on
the judiciary. Moreover, it would impose costs of two kinds. The
decision about which discriminatory effects were permissible and why
would be enormously complex. Serious strains would be imposed on
the judiciary, particularly in the remedial process.
        </p>
        <p>The utilitarian and other losses-including enforcement
problems-of abandoning Lochner are thus relevant to the constitutional
inquiry. They will tend to be largest in cases in which other branches of
government support the practice under attack. When, for example,
Congress has enacted a statute abandoning Lochner-like principles,
these considerations are secondary. In such cases the elected branches
have decided that the utilitarian losses are properly incurred, and
problems of enforcement are minimized. When the elected branches
are on the other side, however, those losses and problems are properly
taken into account. They are a secondary consideration, buttressing
the development of substantive and institutional theories in the wake of</p>

        <title>F. Summary</title>
        <p>We have seen that the question whether Lochner-like premises
should be abandoned cannot be answered in the abstract. The issue
depends on a mixture of substantive, institutional, and interpretive
considerations. The substantive problems present issues of distributive
justice; the institutional issues present problems of democratic theory;
the interpretive questions raise problems of linguistic theory as well as
substantive and institutional issues.20 4 In generating a set of
constitutional doctrines in the aftermath of Lochner, it is necessary to proceed
with considerable caution. No formula is available. But the foregoing
discussion suggests some generalizations and examples that may prove
helpful here. In Lochner itself, the textual pedigree of the decision was
uncertain; and the outcome reached by the Court ran in the face of a
powerful and mounting national consensus in the other direction.
Similar considerations justify, at least in broad outline, the Court's current
approach to the takings and contracts clauses. These provisions are
necessarily Lochner-like in character; they cannot be read out of the
Constitution, but a generous approach to the police power is
appropri204. For some, the three problems, in concert, mean thatjudges must decide cases
by reference to the "intent of the framers," or original meaning, or some other
purportedly sharp constraint on judicial decisions. That approach is rejected here. See supra
note 167 and accompanying text.
ate under both provisions. Affirmative action for both race and gender
is relatively easy. The measures in question have been adopted
democratically; the equal protection clause is a repudiation of Lochner-like
principles; utilitarian concerns cannot be said to count powerfully
against affirmative action and may argue in favor of validation; the
uncertainty of causation is a secondary matter. Judicial review of agency
inaction and standing for regulatory beneficiaries are also relatively
easy. Here Congress has created and endorsed a broad presumption of
reviewability, and most important, review would serve only to vindicate
constitutional and statutory provisions as against the executive branch.
Some benefits that are the creature of statute should stand on the same
footing as common law interests for purposes of both procedural and
substantive due process. The rise of hearing rights for beneficiaries of
spending programs is therefore appropriate. 20 5 Buckley v. Valeo was
decided incorrectly. In the context of financial expenditures, the first
amendment need hardly be read in the Lochner-like fashion suggested
by the Court.</p>
        <p>The most difficult cases here involve discriminatory effects under
the equal protection clause, welfare rights, and some of the state action
cases, including those that raise the possibility of a right to protection
against private racial discrimination. Viewed through the lens of the
Lochner period, these decisions seem incorrect in their reasoning and
questionable in their outcomes. All of them depend on premises about
the appropriate baseline that were properly rejected during the Lochner
period. But as we have seen, there are powerful prudential and
institutional considerations that argue in favor of caution. The primary
purpose here is not to suggest how such cases should be decided, now or
in the near future, but instead to remove one of the props supporting
current doctrine and to suggest some of the relevant inquiries.</p>
        <p>CONCLUSION</p>
        <p>The Lochner Court required government neutrality and was
skeptical of government "intervention"; it defined both notions in terms of
whether the state had threatened to alter the common law distribution
of entitlements and wealth, which was taken to be a part of nature
rather than a legal construct. Once the common law system came to be
seen as a product of legal rules, the baseline from which constitutional
decisions were made had to shift. When the Lochner framework was
abandoned in West Coast Hotel, the common law system itself appeared
to be a subsidy to employers. The West Coast Hotel Court thus adopted
an alternative baseline and rejected Lochner era understandings of
neutrality and action.</p>
        <p>
          If the Lochner era is thought to embody less an active judicial role
205. Cf.J. Mashaw, Due Process in the Administrative State (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">1985</xref>
          ) (justifying such
rights on participatory and dignatory grounds).
and more particular conceptions of baseline, neutrality, and action, it
has not been entirely overruled. Numerous modem decisions reflect
similar understandings. Cases distinguishing between "positive" and
"negative" rights are built on Lochner-like premises that take the
common law as the baseline for decision. Much of the law of racial
discrimination can be understood similarly, though here the baseline is the
status quo rather than the common law. The constitutional attack on
affirmative action, indeed the very term, suggests that the current
distribution of benefits and burdens along racial lines is simply "there." The
state action doctrine borrows heavily from common law understandings
about the proper role of government. Some of first amendment
doctrine, especially that involving campaign financing, is based on similar
premises.
        </p>
        <p>It is one thing to identify Lochner-like premises in current
constitutional law; it is quite another to suggest when and how they should be
abandoned. One possible approach would be to reject, in the fashion
ofJustice Holmes, any baseline as a matter of constitutional law. Under
this approach, the distribution of wealth and entitlements would be for
political rather than legal determination. But we have seen that such an
approach is too crude, for it would spell an end to constitutionalism. If
the idea of baselines is to be retained, and if Lochner is at least
sometimes to be abandoned, the task for the future is to develop theories of
distributive justice, derived from constitutional text and purposes, that
might serve as the basis for evaluating any particular practice.</p>
        <p>Whether and how to develop and implement such theories is a
mixture of substantive and institutional problems. We have seen that
whether Lochner-like premises are used to invalidate or uphold
legislation is relevant. Moreover, some provisions are most plausibly
understood in Lochner-like terms, whereas others self-consciously reject those
premises; consider the equal protection clause. Second-order
considerations include whether there is a clear causal connection between
identifiable social practices and the harms invoked by the plaintiff.
Social consequences, including utilitarian losses, properly play a role in
the decision. Development and implementation of an alternative
approach that would incorporate those inquiries is a large task indeed.
But there is reason to reject several lines of cases that depend on
Lochner-like premises, as in the areas of campaign finance regulation,
judicial review of agency inaction, gender discrimination, and
affirmative action. There is reason as well to raise questions about the
reasoning and perhaps the outcome in more difficult areas, involving
discriminatory effects and "positive" rights.</p>
        <p>However these questions are resolved, the central issue in
numerous areas of the law-involving campaign finance regulation, hearing
rights, affirmative action, gender and race discrimination, standing,
review of agency inaction, state action, and "positive" rights-is whether
there is a constitutional requirement of neutrality that commands
