 Words, Conduct, Caste Cass R. Sunsteint How do we know what counts as speech and what counts as conduct? When is government disabled from regulating conduct that is intended to express ideas? What is the relationship between constitutional principles of equality and constitutional principles of free expression? And how do these questions bear on current controversies over pornography and hate speech? In this Essay, I propose some answers to these questions. I offer these general propositions: 1. As a matter of history and principle, the constitutional commitment to equality should be understood as a prohibition against systems with caste-like features.

This Essay was originally produced for the conference, "Speech, Equality, and Harm: Feminist Legal Perspectives on Pornography and Hate Propaganda," held at The University of Chicago Law School on March 3-5, 1993; the purpose of the presentation was to provide a broad overview of legal questions raised by controls on hate speech and pornography. In putting the presentation together, I draw on a several other writings, especially Cass R. Sunstein, Democracy and the Problem of Free Expression (Free Press, 1993), which puts the arguments offered here in the context of a much broader discussion of the meaning of the free speech principle. Related issues are discussed in Cass R. Sunstein, The Partial Constitution chs 7-8 (Harvard, 1993). The reader is asked to make allowances for an essay originally intended for oral presentation. in eliminating the caste-like features of current society; the job of implementation belongs mostly to the elected branches of government.

Racial hate speech, including cross-burning, often qualifies as speech. In some circumstances, it is high-value speech. Much racist speech belongs at the free speech core because it is a selfconscious contribution to social deliberation about political issues. Government may, of course, regulate such speech through the trespass laws or through other content-neutral methods. In many of the hard cases, the question is whether the relevant regulation is adequately neutral. This Essay is organized into five sections. Section I briefly sets out an equality principle that bears on free speech problems. Using conventional doctrinal categories, Section II offers an argument for allowing regulation of certain forms of pornography and hate speech. Section III discusses the view that regulation of this kind is impermissibly selective. Section IV attempts to sort out some complex issues involving the distinction between words and conduct. Section V outlines some possible directions for the future; it pays special attention to the possibility of preventing harms through strategies that do not raise First Amendment problems. I am concerned here with the relationship between equality and free speech. To discuss that relationship, we must first identify the appropriate conception of equality. At the origin, the central target of the Fourteenth Amendment was not irrational distinctions based on race, but rather the system of racial caste in-American society.3 For those who ratified the post-Civil War Amendments, the problem was that the law had contributed to a system of caste based on race, thought to be a morally irrelevant characteristic. the various measures that grew up in the aftermath of abolition.6 The animating purpose of the Civil War Amendments was an attack on racial caste. But was there any domination which did not appear natural to those who possessed it? . . . So true is it that unnatural generally means only uncustomary, and that everything which is usual appears natural. The subjection of women to men being a universal custom, any departure from it quite naturally appears unnatural.7 A principal feature of the caste system based on gender consists of legal and social practices that translate women's sexual and reproductive capacities into a source of second-class citizenship. Consider, for example, inequalities in political influence, the disproportionate subjection of women to poverty and sexual violation, and differences in educational opportunity and health care.8 In these circumstances, I suggest that the appropriate equality principle in the areas of both race and sex equality is an opposition to caste. The legal objection should be understood as an effort to eliminate, in places large and small, caste-like discrimination rooted in race and gender. The controlling principle is not that blacks and women must be treated "the same" as whites and men, but that blacks and women must not be second-class citizens. Consider, for example, Senator Pratt's remarks during debate on proposed amendments to the Civil Rights Act of 1875: "You object because they have been a servile race and are as yet unfit to perform the duties of citizenship. But who made them slaves and kept them in ignorance?" 43d Cong, 1st Sess (May 20, 1874), in 2 Cong Rec 4082. So distinctive and so separated was the aristocracy from ordinary folk that many still thought the two groups represented two orders of being .... Ordinary people were thought to be different physically, and because of varying diets and living conditions, no doubt in many cases they were different. People often assumed that a handsome child, though apparently a commoner, had to be some gentleman's bastard offspring. for a discussion of many of these inequalities. the obligations of legislatures. It should not be forgotten that the nation originally anticipated legislative enforcement of the obligations of the Civil War Amendments.9 Indeed, the judicial enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment stands as one of the most profound ironies in constitutional history. In the aftermath of the Dred Scott decision, the ratifiers anticipated legislative rather than judicial implementation of the Civil War Amendments, and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment was thought especially important.10 History aside, a high degree of judicial caution is justified on many grounds. Courts lack the relevant factfinding abilities and policymaking competence. Because their judgments are not selfimplementing, judges often fail when they attempt to produce large-scale social reform.1" There are also serious problems of democratic legitimacy when courts seek to introduce large changes on their own. For these reasons, courts ought to play a cautious role in the elimination of caste. But the need for judicial caution should not obscure the substantive point: The anticaste principle lies at the heart of the constitutional prohibition, and that principle imposes substantial duties on Congress and the President. gender, and those needs may bear on what government should do. A systemic disadvantage is one that operates along standard and predictable lines in multiple important spheres of life, and applies in realms that relate to basic participation as a citizen in a democracy. These realms include education, health care, freedom from private and public violence, wealth, political representation, and political influence. 15 The anticaste principle means that one group ought not to be systematically beneath another with respect to basic human capabilities and functionings.1' A particular concern is that self-respect and its social bases ought not to be distributed along the lines of race and gender. 17 The social practices in a system of caste produce a range of obstacles to the development of self-respect, largely because of the presence of the morally irrelevant characteristic that gives rise to caste-like status. stitutional essentials"). Political Liberalism at 318. Very provisionally, I propose that the free speech principle attempts to protect all symbols, whether or not words, that contribute to the exchange of ideas. (I offer many refinements and qualifications below.) Thus understood, the free speech principle can march hand-in-hand with the anticaste principle, and there is usually no tension between them. When tension does arise, courts ought to minimize infringements on either principle. But it is certainly imaginable that unrestricted speech can contribute to gender and racial caste. For example, a principal feature of a caste system consists of disproportionate subjection to public and private violence. Acts that are symbolic and expressive in character-like some lynchings and some rapes-are important features of a constitutionally unacceptable caste system. But the problem is not limited to expressive acts. It is plausible that in their production and use, some forms of pornography are associated with violence against women. 20 It is also plausible that both pornography and racial hate speech have corrosive consequences on the self-respect of women and blacks. In these circumstances, unrestricted speech may contribute to the maintenance of a system with castelike features. In this Section, I set the debate over pornography and hate speech in the context of general First Amendment doctrine.2 2 Current law distinguishes between low-value and high-value speech; it treats bribery, perjury, unlicensed medical and legal advice, misleading commercial speech, and much else as bannable on the basis of a lesser showing of harm.2 3 An approach of this sort is not only embedded in current law; it is also practically unavoidable. There is no way to run a system of free expression without making distinctions between different forms of speech in terms of their centrality to free speech ideals. I suggest that much pornography stands far afield of those ideals and is regulable because of the tangible harms that it causes. Hate speech often does stand at the free speech core, but it can be regulated (a) in a content-neutral way, as through the trespass laws, and (b) with narrow controls on epithets amounting to "fighting words." I also suggest that colleges and universities should have mildly greater authority over this form of speech. A now-familiar position, originally developed by Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon, has emerged on the question of legal control of pornography.2 4 The precise nature of this position is of course a matter of controversy. As I shall present the argument here, the basic claim is that sexually explicit speech should be regulated not because it is sexually explicit (the problem of "obscenity") but because and when it merges sex with violence (the problem of "pornography"). The problem of pornography does not stem from offense, from public access to sexually explicit materials, from an unregulated erotic life, or from violation of traditional values or community standards. Instead, the problem consists of tangible real-world harms, caused by the portrayal of women and children as objects for the control and use of others, most prominently through sexual violence. The objection to pornography is thus closely associated with the anticaste principle, as that principle manifests itself in many efforts to prevent sex-related violence. 25 1. Pornography, coercion, and violence. possible that someone could be coerced to participate in nonviolent pornography, and this could be tortious under the approach I am suggesting. gal standards, that they have been harmed by the use of pornography to stimulate sex crimes. 29 In both cases, the usual remedy would be an award of monetary damages for actual harm. In some circumstances, a victim might also seek an injunction to prevent continued distribution or use of harmful material. For example, a woman forced to participate in a pornographic movie might be permitted to enjoin further sale of the movie. How is the First Amendment issue affected if women injured by pornography are given a civil action and if criminal prosecutors have no enforcement authority? In some ways, the civil action helps alleviate the First Amendment concerns. There is a special problem whenever the government proceeds against speech that it deems harmful, and a private suit does not pose this problem. In particular, there might seem to be no free speech problem if a woman injured in the production of pornography brings suit to recover damages for the harms done to her.32 On the other hand, the 2' See Marianne Wesson, Girls Should Bring Lawsuits Everywhere... Nothing Will be Corrupted: Pornography as Speech and Product, 60 U Chi L Rev 845 (1993) (in this issue). state is unquestionably involved when it awards damages for harms done by speech, and we know from New York Times v Sullivan3 that the First Amendment imposes barriers to government efforts to force speakers to pay for the real costs that their speech produces. The parallel to New York Times is very close if the government says that anyone who produces art and literature must pay for injuries that result from his work. The question is not limited to material containing sexual violence. Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment is said to have been followed by a series of copycat murders in Russia. punishing speech that constitutes "seditious advocacy"). cussing non-speech-chilling methods of compensating victims of speech-related harms). 3. Antipornography vs. antiobscenity. Meiklejohn, Free Speech and Its Relation to Self-Government (Harper, 1948). the exchange of ideas, political or otherwise; they operate as masturbatory aids and do not qualify for top-tier First Amendment protection under the prevailing theories. 45 An important qualification is necessary here. Those who write or read sexually explicit material can often claim important expressive and deliberative interests. 46 Sexually explicit works can be highly relevant to the development of individual capacities. For many, they are important vehicles for self-discovery and self-definition.41 In light of the complexity of sexuality, the same might be said of some of the most graphic forms of sexually explicit material, even if they feature violence. Perhaps such speech is not intended and received as a contribution to democratic debate. But the development of individual capacities is instrumental to democratic characteristics, 4s and in any case it might be urged that the presence of expressive and deliberative interests qualifies material for treatment as within the free speech core. '5 To be sure, pornography is political in the sense that it has political consequences. But this does not mean that it is political in the First Amendment sense of that word. Much speech that does not belong in the top tier-misleading commercial speech, attempted bribery of public officials-has political consequences. If speech qualifies for the top tier whenever it has such consequences, almost all speech would so qualify, and First Amendment doctrine would be made senseless. Instead, the test is whether it is intended and received as a contribution to democratic deliberation-and much pornography fails that test. It is true that the recent attack on pornography has drawn attention to its political character, but this fact does not undermine the First Amendment argument, since the First Amendment conception of "the political" is properly and importantly different from the conception of "the political" in popular discussion. that they belong in the free speech core. If they did, they could not be regulable in light of the stringent standards applied to material within the core. To be sure, such materials are associated with harm; but for material in the core, the proper approach would be to attack the offending conduct directly rather than the speech, and to allow the speech so long as the Brandenburg v Ohio50 standard has not been met. These considerations suggest that material ought not to belong in the free speech core, or in any top tier of protection, by virtue of its connection with deliberative and expressive interests, even if it is assumed that pornography is wellconnected with those interests. women who participate are not so abused. It is therefore tempting to respond that government should adopt a less restrictive alternative. Rather than regulating the speech, government should ban the coercion or mistreatment, as indeed current state law does. Usually this strategy is indeed better and even constitutionally required. 3 But in this peculiar setting, such an alternative would be a recipe for disaster, because it would simply allow existing practices to continue. The enforcement problems are so difficult that restrictions on the material are necessary to supplement the criminal ban. 4 Second, it is reasonable to think that there is a causal connection between pornography and violence against women. 5 The extent of the effect and the precise relationship between exposure to pornographic and sexual violence are sharply disputed. No one suggests that sexual violence would disappear if pornography were eliminated, or that most consumers of violent pornography act out what they see or read. But a review of the literature suggests a reasonable legislature could conclude that pornography does increase the incidence of sexual violence against women. The evidence includes laboratory experiments, longitudinal studies of the effects of increased availability of pornography, and victim and po 53 It is by no means clear that government can ban speech merely because there is illegality in its production or acquisition. See New York Times v United States, 403 US 713 (1971) (allowing publication of material that was acquired unlawfully). Especially when the material belongs in the free speech top tier, the proper remedy is to prevent the illegality rather than to prevent the publication, at least if the Brandenburg standard cannot be met. In most cases, government should be required to proceed against the offending conduct. But in the context of pornography, these strictures should not apply. By hypothesis, the material is not in the top tier, and for reasons stated in the text, it seems inadequate to require the government to proceed against the conduct. lice testimony.5 7 All three sources indicate a plausible connection between exposure to sexually violent material and sexually violent acts. this kind presents severe methodological problems. Laboratory experiments may inadequately connect to the real world, longitudinal studies cannot easily control for other variables, and victim and police testimony is anecdotal. Even if there were a close causal connection between pornography and real-world violence, social science would have a hard time proving it. But the current evidence is sufficiently suggestive to indicate that the real question is not the existence of a causal connection but its degree. In light of current information, it would be reasonable for a legislature to think that there would be genuine benefits from regulation of violent pornography. The third and most general point is that pornography promotes degrading and dehumanizing behavior toward women. Significantly, this behavior includes a variety of forms of illegal conduct, prominent among them sexual harassment. The pornography industry operates as a conditioning factor for some men and women, a factor that has consequences for equality between men and women. These conditioning effects are associated with harmful consequences for self-respect. Of course, pornography is more symptom than cause; but it is cause as well. One need not believe that the elimination of pornography would bring about sexual equality, eliminate sexual violence, or change social attitudes in any fundamental way in order to agree that a regulatory effort could reduce violence and diminish views that contribute to existing inequalities. ting is a possible example in that certain sorts of abusive faculty speech may silence student speech. form of protection and because the harms produced by such speech are sufficient to allow for regulation. The same is true of libel of private persons, criminal solicitation, unlicensed legal or medical advice, and conspiracy. Certain forms of pornography should be approached similarly. Indeed, the argument for regulation-in view of the nature of the material and the evidence of harm-seems more powerful than the corresponding argument for many forms of speech now subject to government control. Thus far, then, the hard issues have to do with the appropriate breadth and clarity of any prohibition, not with the basic approach. Hate speech raises quite different issues from pornography. Hate speech is often part and parcel of public debate on certain questions; pornography is not. Many forms of pornography are far from the center of constitutional concern; nothing of this sort can be said for the many kinds of hate speech that are designed and received as judgments about certain social questions. If restrictions on hate speech cover not merely epithets but also speech that is part of social deliberation, they appear overbroad and unconstitutional for that very reason.6 2 Speech that is intended and received as a contribution to social deliberation is constitutionally protected even if it amounts to hate speech-even if it is racist and sexist. In a famous case, Justice Frankfurter, speaking for a 5-4 majority, seemed to reject this view. Beauharnais v Illinois3 upheld an Illinois law making it unlawful to publish or exhibit any publication that "portrays depravity, criminality, unchastity, or lack of virtue of a class of citizens, which [publication] exposes the citizens of any race, color, creed or religion to contempt, derision, or obloquy or which is productive of breach of the peace or riots. 6 4 The law was applied to ban circulation of a petition urging "the need to prevent the white race from becoming mongrelized by the negro," and complaining of the "aggressions, rapes, robberies, knives, guns and marijuana of the negro. 6 5 In upholding the law, Justice Frankfurter referred to the historical exclusion of libel from free speech protection, to the risks to social cohesion created by racial hate speech, and to the need for judicial deference to legislative judgments on these complex matters.66 Many countries in Europe accept the same analysis and do not afford protection to racial and ethnic hate speech. 7 But most people think that after New York Times v Sullivan, Beauharnais is no longer the law. 8 In New York Times, the Court indicated that the law of libel must be evaluated in accordance with the constitutional commitment to robust debate on public issues. 9 The conventional view-which the Supreme Court has not directly addressed-is that racial hate speech contains highly political ideas, and that it may not be suppressed merely because it is offensive or otherwise harmful. whether "Beauharnais would pass constitutional muster today"). tioning democracy. In this light, there is nothing obvious about the view that the law should be banned from guarding against speech that causes racial hatred. As noted above, most European countries, including flourishing democracies committed to free speech, make exceptions for such expression. In many countries, including our own, it is possible to think that racial and ethnic hate speech is really sui generis, and that it is properly treated differently from other forms of political speech. These general propositions do not resolve all of the questions raised by restrictions on hate speech, but they do suggest that distinctions must be drawn between different forms of speech that fall within the category. It seems to follow that many imaginable restrictions on hate speech cut too broadly. Consider, for example, the University of Michigan's judicially invalidated ban on "[a]ny behavior, verbal or physical, that stigmatizes or victimizes an individual on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, creed, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, handicap, or Vietnam-era veteran status, and that . . [c]reates an intimidating, hostile, or demeaning environment for educational pursuits ,,73This sort of broad ban forbids a wide range of statements that are part of the exchange of ideas. It also fails to give people sufficient notice of what statements are allowed. For both reasons, it should be invalidated. 7 See John Stuart Mill, On Liberty, reprinted in John M. Robson, ed, 18 Collected university, free from constitutional restraint; but it has chosen to comply with its understanding of what the First Amendment means as applied to public universities.) 7 5 Under the Stanford rule, speech qualifies as regulable "harassment" if it: (a) is intended to insult or stigmatize an individual or a small number of individuals on the basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or national and ethnic origin; and (b) is addressed directly to the individual or individuals whom it insults or stigmatizes; and (c) makes use of insulting or "fighting" words or nonverbal symbols. 6 To qualify under (c), the speech must by its "very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite to an immediate breach of the peace," and must be "commonly understood to convey direct and visceral hatred or contempt for human beings on the basis of" one of the grounds enumerated in (b).7 The Stanford regulation should not be faulted for excessive breadth. It is quite narrowly defined. Unlike the Michigan rule, it does not reach far beyond epithets to forbid the expression of views on public issues. On an analogy to the obscene telephone call, which is without constitutional protection 7 8 official restrictions of the sort represented by the Stanford regulation should not be invalidated under the First Amendment. If this general approach is correct, the problem of hate speech should turn on whether the speech at issue plausibly qualifies as a contribution to the exchange of ideas. 9 If it does not, it can be regulated on the basis of the relevant showing of harm. I have not yet discussed the issue of selectivity. The Supreme Court has made clear that discrimination on the basis of viewpoint lies at the heart of the free speech prohibition.8 0 For example, the government may not draw lines between libel of conservatives and libel of liberals-even if the relevant libel is generally without constitutional protection. Similarly, the government could not impose special penalties on fighting words directed against Republicans. The antipornography position remains poorly represented not only in popular debate but also in current constitutional law. Above all, the position is said to run afoul of the prohibition on viewpoint discrimination. I suggest that part of what has made the antipornography approach so controversial is that it is rooted in a belief that there is something like a caste system based on gender-that women are treated unequally to men, that the sexual and reproductive status quo, as between men and women, is itself sometimes a place for inequality, that sexual violence by men against women is a greater social problem than sexual violence by women against men, and that social inequality can be both expressed and perpetuated through sexuality. The rejection of these propositions-a refusal to recognize existing inequality, transmuted into a claim of partiality-has proved to be critical for constitutional law. The objection here is that the antipornography position is selective (especially compared with the antiobscenity approach), and that in its selectivity lies its partisanship, which is what makes it fatally inferior to its competitors. subcategory of obscene speech, defined by reference to these harms, would be unconstitutional. s2 For the court, the key point is that such an approach would constitute impermissible "thought control," since it would "establish[ ] an 'approved' view of women, of how they may react to sexual encounters, [and] of how the sexes may relate to each other."8' 3 Under the antipornography approach, depictions of sexuality that involve rape and violence against women may be subject to regulation, whereas depictions that do not are uncontrolled. It is the nonneutrality of antipornography legislation-its focus on violence against women-that is its central defect. People with the approved view can speak; people with the disapproved view cannot. That, in the court's view, is what the First Amendment centrally prohibits.8 4 The general point seems correct; the prohibition on viewpoint discrimination does lie at the heart of the free speech guarantee.8 5 But especially in this setting, the category of viewpoint neutrality proves far more difficult to understand than it appears at first glance. First Amendment law contains several categories of speech that are subject to ban or regulation even though they are nonneutral in very much the same sense as antipornography legislation. Imagine, for example, that government bans advertising in favor of gambling at casinos. This restriction seems viewpointbased. Such bans do not simultaneously prohibit advertising aimed against gambling. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has upheld this unquestionably viewpoint-based restriction. 6 82 Id at 330-32. 83 Id at 328. 8 Id at 328-32. 85 See Stone, 25 Wm & Mary L Rev at 198 (cited in note 1). 96 Posadas v Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 US 328 (1986). Perhaps it would be possible to argue that the restriction is not really viewpoint-based, because there is no real category called "advertisements against gambling." Speech of that kind is really a public-interest announcement. Real viewpoint discrimination would consist of a ban on "pro-gambling" messages, which are not banned. The prohibition on advertisements for casino gambling does not prevent people from advertising their view that gambling is a good idea. On this view, the ban on casino gambling-and the other examples offered in the text-are not real examples of viewpoint discrimination. Courts have also upheld restrictions on cigarette or liquor advertising on television 87-even though there are no restrictions on the plentiful advertising aimed against the smoking of cigarettes or the drinking of liquor. These restrictions constitute another example of acceptable viewpoint discrimination. Perhaps the most vivid illustration of such discrimination is the ban on advertising of unlawful products or activities.18 I cannot sell an advertisement for cocaine or heroin, even though the government permits and even encourages advertisements designed to stop the use of drugs. There is unambiguous viewpoint discrimination in this state of affairs. We should conclude from all this that there is no per se barrier to viewpoint discrimination. Laws that silence one side in a debate are given a strong presumption of invalidity, but the presumption can be overcome in certain narrow circumstances. Those circumstances appear to occur when there is no serious risk of illegitimate government motivation, when low-value or unprotected speech is at issue, when the skewing effect on the system of free expression is minimal, and when the government is able to make a powerful showing that it is responding to genuine harm. When these requirements are met, the partisanship of the regulation is not apparent because there is so firm a consensus on the presence of real-world harms that the objection from neutrality does not even register. The spectre of partisanship does not arise because a decision to control the speech in question has obvious legitimate justifications, and an extension of the prohibition to other areas appears not compelled by neutrality but instead to be an unnecessary form of censorship. I suggest that the answer lies in the fact that antiobscenity law takes existing social consensus as the foundation for decision, whereas antipornography law is directed against that consensus. Existing practice is the target of the antipornography approach, or what that approach seeks to change; existing practice is the very basis of the antiobscenity approach, or what that approach seeks to preserve. Obscenity law, insofar as it depends on community standards, is deemed neutral only because the class of prohibited speech is defined by reference to existing social values. Antipornography legislation is deemed impermissibly partisan because the prohibited class of speech is defined by less widely accepted ideas about equality between men and women-more precisely, by reference to a belief that equality does not always exist even in the, private realm, that sexual violence by men against women is a greater problem than sexual violence by women against men, and that the sexual status quo is an ingredient in sexual inequality. I conclude that the argument for regulating materials that combine sex with violence is more powerful than the corresponding argument for regulating obscenity. Since perfectly conventional measures regulating speech are similarly partisan and have properly been upheld, the objection from non-neutrality is unpersuasive here as well. More particularly, the standards for accepting laws that contain viewpoint discrimination seem to be met here. There are sufficient justifications based on tangible harms. By hypothesis, the regulated speech is low-value under any plausible approach to valuation under the First Amendment. aspirations of the Equal Protection Clause. Such an effort should not be deemed inconsistent with neutrality. Are restrictions on hate speech impermissibly selective? In R.A.V. v City of St. Paul,9' the Court invalidated a law directed against a certain kind of hate speech, principally on the ground that it discriminated on the basis of subject matter. As interpreted by the Minnesota Supreme Court, the relevant law banned any fighting words that produced anger or resentment on the basis of race, religion, or gender." The R.A.V. Court emphasized that the law at issue was not a broad or general proscription of fighting words. 96 Instead, the law reflected a decision to single out a certain category of "fighting words," defined in terms of audience reactions to speech about certain topics.9 7 Is this constitutionally ille gitimate? The point bears on almost all efforts to regulate hate speech.8 Subject matter restrictions are not all the same. We can imagine subject matter restrictions that are questionable ("no one may discuss homosexuality on the subway") and subject matter restrictions that seem legitimate ("no high-level CIA employee may speak publicly about classified matters relating to the clandestine affairs of the American government."9 ) As a class, subject matter restrictions appear to occupy a point somewhere between viewpoint-based restrictions and content-neutral ones. Sometimes courts uphold such restrictions as a form of permissible content regulation. For example, the Court has permitted prohibitions of political advertising on buses 0 0 and of partisan political speech at army bases. 10 1 These cases show that there is no per se ban on subject matter restrictions. When the Court upholds subject matter restrictions, it is either because the line drawn by government gives no real reason for fear about lurking viewpoint discrimination, or (what is close to the same thing) because government is able to invoke neutral, harm-based justifications for treating certain subjects differently from others. In raising this issue, hate speech restrictions pose many of the same problems discussed above in connection with pornography. 93 In the following discussion, I draw on Cass R. Sunstein, On Analogical Reasoning, 106 Harv L Rev 741, 759-66 (1993), though I have made a number of new points here. See also Sunstein, Democracy and the Problem of Free Expression ch 7 (cited in note 22), which discusses R.A.V. and the issue of viewpoint discrimination in more detail. Council may determine that threats based on the target's race, religion, or gender cause more severe harm to both the target and society than other threats."' 1 2 In his view, "[t]hreatening someone because of her race or religious beliefs may cause particularly severe trauma or touch off a riot. . . such threats may be punished more severely than threats against someone based on, for example, his support of a particular athletic team." 10 3 Thus there were "legitimate, reasonable, and neutral justifications" for the special rule.104 Justice Stevens' argument is highly reminiscent of the claim that antipornography legislation should be seen as an acceptable response to harm rather than an imposition of a point of view. is 18 USC § 871 (1988). See also 18 USC § 879 (1988) (regulating threats against former presidents). Justice Stevens was responding to the majority's argument that laws increasing the penalty for threats against the President are permissible because the reasons for these laws relate to the justification for punishing threats in the first place. See text accompanying note 92. kind of "fighting word" has especially severe social consequences. According to the Court, on the other hand, a state cannot legitimately decide that cross-burning is worse than (for example) a vicious attack on your political convictions or your parents. A decision to this effect violates neutrality. But the Court's conception of neutrality seems wrong. There is nothing partisan or illegitimate in recognizing that this unusual class of fighting words causes distinctive harms. Justice Scalia's response is probably the best that can be offered: "[T]he reasons why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment (protecting individuals from fear of violence, from the disruption that fear engenders, and from the possibility that threatened violence will occur) have special force when applied to the President."1 08 But exactly the same could be said of the hate speech ordinance under discussion: the justification for the fighting words exemption has special force because of the context of racial injustice. Here, as in cases involving threats against the President, we are dealing with a subcategory of unprotected speech challenged as involving impermissible selectivity, and the justification for the selectivity involves the particular harms of the unprotected speech at issue. That justification seems sufficiently neutral. states. 0 9 Do those penalties violate the First Amendment? In Wisconsin v Mitchell,1 10 a unanimous Supreme Court said that they do not, and I believe the Court was right. But consider the fact that the government imposes the additional penalty because it thinks that hate crimes create distinctive subjective and objective harm. The distinctive harm is produced in part because of the symbolic or expressive nature of hate crimes. This justification is the same as that in the cross-burning case. This does not mean that it is impossible to draw distinctions between enhanced penalty statutes and "hate speech" laws. But it does mean that if the justification for the hate crimes measures is sufficiently neutral, the same should be said for narrow restrictions on hate speech. the expressive acts at issue were unprotected by the First Amendment, because the state court had said that the statute was limited to unprotected "fighting words." R.A.V. therefore involved constitutionally unprotected acts, just as Mitchell did. And everyone in Mitchell agreed that the First Amendment issue did not disappear simply because conduct was involved. The Court said that "a physical assault is not by any stretch of the imagination expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment"1 1 4; but it rightly added that a genuine First Amendment issue is raised when a state "enhances the maximum penalty for conduct motivated by a discriminatory point of view." 1 5 is characteristically Understood in these terms, R.A.V. and Mitchell are very close, and the Court did not adequately explain the difference between them. Perhaps the major distinction between the two cases is that the Minnesota law in R.A.V. covered speech as well as expressive expressive conduct, and cross-burning the enhancement statute was directed only at conduct, -whereas and many hate crimes are not intended or received as a communication on anything at all. For this reason, the enhancement penalty can perhaps be seen as a content-neutral restriction on conduct that is not ordinarily expressive, while the Minnesota law was a content-based restriction on speech, including expressive conduct. This is a reasonable distinction. But it is not clear that the distinction really rescues the R.A.V. outcome. The question remains whether the state had a legitimate justification for doing what it did. The Mitchell Court emphasized that the state treated "biasinspired" conduct more severely because that conduct inflicts "greater individual and societal harm." 11 6 This was Justice Stevens's argument in R.A.V., and it seems to have equal weight in both cases. cal convictions. In this respect, they are similar to a prohibition on flag-burning. They single out conduct (or mere words) for special penalty simply because of the message communicated by that conduct. response: In its practical 'operation, moreover, the ordinance goes even beyond mere content discrimination to actual viewpoint discrimination. Displays containing some words-odious racial epithets, for example-would be prohibited to proponents of all views. But 'fighting words' that do not themselves invoke race, color, creed, religion, or gender-aspersions based upon a person's mother, for example-would be seemingly usable ad libitum in the placards of those arguing in favor of racial, color, etc. tolerance and equality, but could not be used by . St. Paul has no such authority that speaker's opponents. . . to license one side of a debate to fight freestyle, while requiring the other to follow Marquis of Queensbury Rules. 118 The short answer to this argument is that the ordinance at issue does not embody viewpoint discrimination as that term is ordinarily understood. Viewpoint discrimination occurs if the government takes one side in a debate, as in, for example, a law saying that libel of the President will be punished more severely than libel of anyone else. Viewpoint discrimination is not established by the fact that in some hypotheticals, one side has greater means of expression than another, at least-and this is the critical point-if the restriction on means has legitimate, neutral justifications. C. Hate Speech, Neutrality, and the University In the previous Section, I argued for the constitutionality of narrow restrictions on hate speech, but R.A. V. suggests that courts might invalidate such restrictions as unacceptably selective. After R.A.V., a university might well be forbidden to single olit for punishment speech that many universities want to control: (a) a narrowly defined category of insults toward such specifically enumerated groups as blacks, women, and homosexuals; or (b) a narrowly defined category of insults directed at individuals involving race, sex, and sexual orientation. Under current law, a restriction that involves (a) is viewpoint-based, and to that extent worse than the restriction in R.A. V. itself. A restriction that involves (b) is a subject-matter restriction, not based on viewpoint, 121 but it is still impermissibly selective in the same sense as the restriction invalidated in the R.A.V. case. We might think that the conclusions in R.A.V. are incorrect in principle, because there are sufficiently neutral grounds for restrictions (a) and (b): A public university could neutrally decide that epithets directed against blacks, women, and homosexuals cause distinctive harms.1 22 But this conclusion is hard to reconcile with the R.A.V. decision. form of subject-matter restriction, but it may well turn out to be viewpoint-based in practice. In many places, a student who defends fascism or communism is unlikely to receive a good grade, and not only because it is hard to argue well on behalf of fascism or communism. Viewpoint discrimination is undoubtedly pervasive in practice, and even though it is usually objectionable, courts cannot and perhaps should not attempt to police it. This is not so only for judgments about student performance. Initial hirings, tenure, and promotion all involve subject matter restrictions, and in practice viewpoint discrimination as well. 124 In this respect, the question of speech restrictions in the university is close to the question of selective funding of art. See Sunstein, The Partial Constitution at 308-15 (cited in note 3). compromise the values of education itself. The university might think, for example, that it has a special obligation to protect its students as free and equal members of the community. It might believe that certain narrowly defined forms of hate speech are highly destructive to the students' chance to learn. Perhaps a university should have more leeway to restrict hate speech than a state or locality, precisely because it ought to receive the benefit of the doubt when it invokes concerns of this kind. At least courts should be reluctant to second-guess judgments of this sort when the university can plausibly claim that it needs a relatively narrow restriction in order to safeguard the educational mission. Words, Conduct, Caste at least in the university setting, more severe than the harms caused by other kinds of fighting words. Free speech law has been bedeviled by the "speech-condu~t" distinction. In this Section, I argue that some forms of conduct should be treated as speech, but that some words should not be treated as speech. A general conclusion follows from the argument: The constitutional protection of "speech" refers to something that we should consider a term of art. That term covers all symbols that are intended and received as expressing messages. Under this view, some words are not "speech" within the meaning of the First Amendment, and some "conduct" does qualify as speech. Under this view, we should make no rigid distinction between "speech" and "conduct." We should distinguish instead between words and conduct, with the understanding that the Constitution protects speech, a term that includes some, but hardly all, words and conduct. And under this view, a theory of free speech value, referred to in Section I, helps explain why some conduct is regulable only (a) on a content-neutral basis or (b) when government can make the ordinary showing required for restriction of political speech. What counts as speech within the meaning of the First Amendment? Justice Black famously thought that the Constitution protected "speech" absolutely and "conduct" not at all.125 But no purely formal test can tell us what falls within the two categories. Someone burns a flag as part of a war protest. The "conduct" communicates ideas. Moreover, it communicates ideas in a distinctive way. Should it be excluded from the category of "speech"? Surely not. "Speech" consists of symbols that communicate messages. 128 Words are simply one kind of symbol. The category of speech is not coextensive with the category of words. Flag-burning, insofar as it is a symbol that communicates a message, is speech. It may be regulable on a content-neutral basis, or even on the basis 121 See Cohen v California, 403 US 15, 27 (1971) (Blackmun dissenting) (an opinion that Justice Black joined, arguing that petitioners' action was unprotected because it was conduct and not speech); see also Thomas Emerson, The System of Freedom of Expression 8, 17-18 (Random House, 1970) (making an expression-action distinction). of content when there is harm of a certain nature and degree, but that is a different matter. supportable in this way. Thus in the flag-burning cases, the Supreme Court emphasized that the government did not have a reason for regulation independent of the government's objection to the ideas that flag-burning embodies. The justification for regulation was illegitimate.1 30 On this view, the speech-conduct distinction has been made necessary not because expressive conduct is undeserving of protection, but because government frequently has a sufficiently strong and neutral justification for regulating conduct. The key to the distinction, often thought to lie in the determination of whether the conduct qualifies for initial protection, actually lies in the fact that government often has good reasons for regulating it-just as it has good reasons for applying the trespass laws to political demonstrations." 1 Now that much expressive conduct has been understood to qualify for protection, courts can focus on what is really the central question: the existence of acceptably strong and neutral justifications. it 1 o See id at 410-14; United States v Eichman, 496 US 310, 315-18 (1990). 131 See Adderley v Florida, 385 US 39 (1966). 131 See Sunstein, Democracy and the Problem of Free Expression ch 5 (cited in note 22). On this view, government would have the power to regulate some forms of (for example) nude dancing. Such dancing does warrant at least a degree of First Amendment protection. It is both communicative and expressive. But a state could plausibly decide that some kinds of nude dancing are associated with a range of serious real-world harms, including prostitution, criminal activity of various sorts, and sexual assault. See Barnes v Glen Theatre, 111 S Ct 2456, 2468-71 (1991) (Souter concurring). At least this is so if government can muster evidence that the regulated form of nude dancing does produce these harms, which would be sufficient to justify regulation under the lower-tier speech standards. I conclude that the Supreme Court was probably correct to rule that the First Amendment did not protect nude dancing in the Kitty Kat Lounge. Id at 2463. This is so even if the majority erred in emphasizing the state's moral reservations about public nudity rather than the existence of more tangible harms. See id at 2461-63. Of course, a quite different issue would be raised in a case in which nude dancing was part of a political protest, or if the particular acts could not plausibly be associated with real-world harms. The University of Chicago Law Review I conclude that what is apparently conduct should qualify as speech for First Amendment purposes if it is intended and received as an effort to communicate a message. This conclusion might seem to have extreme consequences-for example, an attempted assassination of the President may well qualify as speech. It does not raise anything like a serious free speech question, however, because government can invoke strong content-neutral reasons for protecting the President's life. But under this test, flagburning, draft-card burning, and cross-burning all qualify as speech; indeed this classification is the easy part of the relevant cases. We have seen that some of what is familiarly characterized as "conduct" actually counts as speech. The converse may also be true. Suppose that the head of a computer company asks the head of other computer companies whether they might not agree to fix prices. Suppose we have nothing but talk, but the talk produces a conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act. Or suppose that an employer discharges an employee by saying, "I don't want people of your religion to work for me." There is no free speech problem in either case. But it is not easy to explain why. changes too. Form and content cannot be distinguished so simply. Flag-burning conveys the relevant message more sharply and distinctively than anything else. If the speaker says instead, "My country is doing wrong," the message will be so muted as to be fundamentally transformed. The availability of purely verbal alternative forms of expression cannot therefore justify failing to protect expressive conduct. of ideas, then price-fixing agreements, threats, bribes, and unlawful discharges probably do not count as speech within the meaning of the Amendment. Alternatively, suppose that the First Amendment protects speech that is intended and received as a contribution to social deliberation about some issue,134 or that words deserve to be treated as speech when their regulation would be an insult to the moral autonomy of the speaker or the listener.13 5 On either of these views, the suppression of some words may not threaten the values that underlie a system of free expression and may be justified if there are sufficient real-world harms. With Words (Clarendon, 2d ed 1975), but I will not deal with those connections here. This argument suggests that some statements are properly classified as conduct because they amount to the commission of acts that are legitimately and independently made unlawful. For example, a racially motivated discharge is low-value speech that creates harms sufficient to justify regulation. But we can also say that the discharge is an independently unlawful act. A purely verbal discharge is simply a means of committing the unlawful act. constitutes conditions that can be made unlawful. This is true for quid pro quo harassment; it is also true of the "hostile-environment" harassment, including the pornography case. Both of these are versions of (b), and in an important way different from (a). Cases that fall in category (b) are harder than those in category (a). They are harder because the government is targeting words themselves rather than words as evidence of an independent illegality. Often the government might want to claim that a statement amounts to the commission of an illegal act, or helps create conditions that violate some law. Whether it can do so depends on the ordinary standards applied to regulation of speech. In other words, government must say something about the issues of value and harm. The view that sexual harassment is regulable under (b) depends on a resolution of those issues. it was produced through illegality-case (e)-it is trying to regulate speech, not conduct. If there is illegality in the production of the material, the case may involve acceptable regulation under category (d) but not because the material is itself "conduct." Under existing law, category (e) does not allow for regulation.' 14 It follows from all this that we cannot justify regulation of hate speech and pornography on the ground that these forms of speech constitute action-although the presence of action in the production of materials, or action as a result of the use of the materials, may be relevant to the First Amendment inquiry. An interesting question is whether we can use the pornography in the workplace example-category (b)-as a ground for saying that some pornography is action, analytically speaking. At this point it is not easy to see how this argument can be made persuasively. I conclude that most pornography is speech, not conduct, but that it is sometimes bannable for the reasons stated in Sections I and IV.A. I have questioned the outcomes in both R.A.V. and Hudnut. But so long as those decisions stand, there are sharp constitutional limits on regulation of hate speech and pornography. It is, of course, important to inquire whether current law is correct, especially in light of the fact that free speech doctrine sometimes changes rapidly. But it would be most disappointing if those interested in eliminating the harms caused by pornography and hate speech were to restrict themselves to criticizing what may well become firmly entrenched law. An important task for the future will be to develop responses to the new legal developments. When pornography is harmful, what approaches should be taken by those concerned with minimizing the relevant harms? If we aim to eliminate caste-like features of current systems, what approaches would make sense? It is clear that the prevention of violence against women-an important aspect of these caste-like features-might be made a greater priority of state and federal government. There are substantial initiatives in this direction, quite outside of the category of speech.4 2 These initiatives, sometimes criticized as an unjustified incursion into the federal structure, fit exceedingly well with the post-Civil War Constitution, which has as one of its purposes the use of federal authority to prevent the disproportionate subjection of certain groups to public and private violence. It seems clear, too, that sexual violence is not only an inadequately enforced crime; it is also an inadequately addressed tort. There should be a range of civil actions against people, including pornographers, who have abused children and women in the home or in the production of their work. An important advantage of this route is that the "reasonable doubt" standard of criminal law need not be met, and recovery can occur under the civil law's more lenient "preponderance of the evidence" standard. Here the First Amendment issues are trivial. Well-publicized tort actions might also deter criminal activity and spur new statutory initiatives. example, to regulate a subcategory of speech that is already regulable under Miller. Other localities might combine the obscenity and pornography approaches and exempt from control all speech with serious social value. Those are simply some of a large number of possible experiments designed to do some good while increasing the chances of judicial validation. I have made three claims in this Essay. First, certain narrowly defined categories of pornography and hate speech can be regulated consistently with the First Amendment. They count as "low value" speech, and they cause sufficient harms to be regulable under existing standards. Broadly speaking, the argument for regulating pornography is stronger than the corresponding argument for regulating hate speech, on both the value and the harm sides; but some well-defined categories of hate speech might be subject to legal controls. Second, the prominent objections from neutrality are misplaced. Some regulations of pornography and hate speech can be neutrally justified, even if they appear discriminatory on the basis of content, subject matter, or even viewpoint. They can be neutrally justified in large part because of the anticaste principle. Third, we should jettison the "speech-conduct" distinction in favor of an approach that explores whether the symbols at issue are intended and received as a contribution to the exchange of ideas about some issue. The University of Chicago Law Review conspicuous. An important element of those practices consists of the disproportionate subjection of women and blacks to public and private violence and to frequent intrusions on their self-respect-the time-honored constitutional notion of stigma. 147 Many imaginable limits on sexually explicit materials and on racist speech would indeed violate the First Amendment. But, I suggest that narrow and well-defined legal controls on pornography and hate speech are simply a part of the attack on systems of racial and gender caste. If they are understood in this light, and if they are appropriately narrow and clear, they can operate without making significant intrusions into a well-functioning system of free expression.
