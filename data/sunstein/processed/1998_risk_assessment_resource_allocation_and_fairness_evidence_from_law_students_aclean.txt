Sunstein Articles, discussions, and research about risk assessment and resource allocation often refer to observed differences between laypersons and "experts."' Experts are said to assess risk and to allocate resources with the goal of maximizing the expected number of lives saved; laypersons are said to depart from this goal, partly because they make frequent errors, and also because they give weight to qualitative variables that make for distinctions among quantitatively identical risks. Ordinary people, it is said, care about whether risks are equitably distributed, voluntarily incurred, controllable, or faced by future generations; they depart from the expert's focus on lives saved.2 No one knows whether lawyers demonstrate "expert" patterns of risk assessment and resource allocation; it might seem intuitive to think that they do, especially, perhaps, if they have been trained with an emphasis on the economic analysis of law. Whether expert or not, the patterns of assessment and allocation that lawyers exhibit likely have great influence in the modern state, for lawyers tend to dominate arenas of governmental decision-making. There is an ample literature on risk assessment, well worth consulting in connection with an Administrative Law course;3 but that literature says little about how lawyers and public officials respond to risk.

Disagree on Environmental Issues (Chicago, 1996). Risk Assessment, Resource Allocation, and Fairness much attention, and why are other risks so often neglected?4 This is a pressing question in both administrative and environmental law. It is therefore useful to think of ways to direct students to consider regulatory priority-setting, preferably in such a way as to encourage their active discussion of these issues from early on in the course. 4. This is the principal question in Stephen Breyer, Breaking the Vicious Circle (Cambridge, concerns of ordinary people, even when those concerns are not matched orjustified by expert assessments. Law students, at least at the University of Chicago, are very different from ordinary people in their judgments about the relation between markets and fairness. Ordinary people think that certain market-driven behavior is unfair, but law students disagree sharply. Law students also offer interesting and highly distinctive judgments about price increases with risk to important products, and with respect to both subsidies and price regulation. (It would be extremely interesting to find out whether this is a consequence of being the sort of person who chooses law school, or of law school itself, or of the University of Chicago Law School.) Resource Allocation Among Risks and Programs The 1997Preliminary Survey We designed the 1997 preliminary survey to test the extent to which number of lives saved, or perhaps some other goals, would play a role in law students' resource allocation decisions. The most straightforward finding was that the number of lives saved is far from the sole consideration for purposes of allocating money. On the contrary, law students are willing to save fewer lives in return for the achievement of other social goals. The most relevant question posited that the respondent was "entrusted with the task of allocating $100 million among a number of possible regulatory activities." Then the survey listed the following six programs. with estimated annual savings of 120 lives. with estimated annual savings of 10 lives. city, with estimated annual savings of 50 lives. the policy options for allocating the $100 million to the following. (smoking), for a total savings of 160 lives annually. program E (smoking), for a total savings of 150 lives annually. program A (AIDS), for a total savings of 110 lives annually. Allocation Policy Number of lives saved Number of programs First choice Second choice (First or second choice) Least-preferred choice Had the respondents attended only to the number of lives saved by a particular allocation, they would have overwhelmingly favored allocation 2, spending all of the money on antismoking measures and saving 200 lives annually. While this allocation did receive 25 first-place votes, there were even more first-place votes for allocation 5, splitting the money between smoking and lead ingestion but saving 50 fewer lives annually. In addition, allocation 2 was second-to-last in number of combined first-place and second-place votes; the allocation receiving most combined first-place and second-place votes was allocation 3, splitting the money between two programs and saving 160 lives annually. Allocation 4, which split the money among five different programs was near average in receiving first-place and second-place votes, but more interesting was its receiving far and away the most last-place votes. Finally, while spending money on AIDS was chosen often when it was joined with other programs, spending money on AIDS alone received the least number of first-place and second-place votes and the second-highest number of lastplace votes. led to the following hypotheses. Journal of Legal Education example, one very rough exploratory analysis indicated that as little as 2.5 percent of the variance in response to these measures might have been explicable by the number of lives saved under each allocation.) " Addressing only one problem might be less preferable in itself than addressing two problems; but addressing five problems and possibly spreading the money too diffusely might be least preferable. The 1998 Survey The 1998 survey sought to test and refine the hypotheses generated by the preliminary 1997 survey, as well as several additional hypotheses about resource allocation among risks and regulatory programs. In the relevant portion of the 1998 survey, respondents were again asked to allocate $100 million among nine programs or regions, as described below. In this survey, however, they were free to allocate the $100 million among the programs or regions in any proportions they wished, rather than being limited to fixed allocations provided for them. Moreover, there was no minimum or maximum allocation for any one program nor any requirement to fund a minimum or maximum number of programs. The resource allocation portion of the 1998 survey required the most complex analysis and interpretation, in part because there were five variant conditions for this portion of the survey. The underlying rationale for these varying conditions (and for this portion of the survey 6. See Lisa K. Goldman & Stanton A. Glantz, Evaluation of Antkmoking Advertising Cam generally) was that we wanted to assess the extent to which various types of information would affect the respondents' allocations. (projected to save 6.0 lives annually per $10 million spent). Journal of Legal Education * Program 4 was described as preventing lead ingestion by children in inner-city schools and buildings. buildings. * The description of program 7 (airline inspections) added that .recent highly publicized incidents have focused public attention on airline safety." * The descrilItion of program 8 added that the program was strongly opposed by the tobacco industry and farmers. ants/fitness and nutrition) were left unchanged. A new government program is to be implemented. For purposes of analyzing the program's effects and distributing funds for the program, the country has been divided into nine regions of approximately equal populition. With regard to the number of lives saved, the program has different effects in different regions. The other effects of the program do not differ substantially among regions. Assume that you are responsible for allocating $100 million among the different regions. Risk Assessment, Resource Allocation, and Fairness annually (per $10 million spent) in that particular region. This condition was analogous (and nearly identical) to the program-minimal condition, which offered only such information for "programs," and the numbers of lives saved for the regions matched those for the programs. * For region 4, the lives saved were noted to be "mostly lives of inner city children." schoolchildren." " For region 5, the lives saved were noted to be "mostly lives of " For region 6, the description of the number of lives saved added that "some members of the public are increasingly concerned that this region might suffer catastrophic loss of lives without the program. " For region 8, the description of the number of lives saved added that "implementing the program in this region is strongly opposed by two powerful special-interest groups." " For regions 2, 3, and 9, the descriptions of the number of lives saved were left unchanged and not enhanced by supplemental information. General Patterns: Efficiency Versus Equity in Resource Allocation Respondents adhering to expert judgments would generally allocate their .$100 million so as to maximize the number of lives saved annually; in that sense, they should strive for maximum efficiency.' Efficiency in this sense would entail allocating all of the money to program 8, to program 9, or to both in any proportion, yielding a total of 160 lives saved annually. But far from a majority of the respondents allocated their funds in the maximally efficient manner; on the contrary, only 23 respondents (24.5%) did so. Clearly, then, factors other than maximizing number of lives saved affected the vast majority of the 7. We do not mean efficiency in a technical sense, which would be based on willingness to pay, a criterion that would generate something other than maximizing lives saved. See Valuing Health for Policy- An Economic Approach, eds. George Tolley et al. (Chicago, 1994). allocations chosen-and the purpose of this survey was indeed to discern what some of those factors might be.8 One potential factor was apparent in the preliminary 1997 survey (and discussed briefly above): namely, people might prefer not to put all of their allocation in one basket, as it were, but instead to spread the wealth among recipients. A possible explanation for this preference is that people are hedging against the risk that any one program might fail to meet its projections for lives saved; as one allocates funds to other programs, one is better assured that at least one of those programs will meet expectations. This explanation is analogous to the explanation for asset allocation and diversification in investment portfolios. But this explanation seems less than compelling- the survey simply asserted projections of lives saved, without delving into probabilities of saving more or fewer lives than projected. We are not inclined to believe that so many respondents considered such matters and hedged accordingly. We operationalized these two factors, efficiency and equity, via summary statistics derived from each respondent's allocation among programs. The simple proxy for efficiency was the total number of lives saved annually under the respondent's allocation of the whole $100 million; we will refer to this variable as total lives. For each program, we calculated the actual lives saved as follows: to program 8, program 9, or both, total lives would equal 160. Lower figures would indicate decreased efficiency. Journal of Legal Education information about the number of lives saved by a program was accompanied by any additional information, total lives (representing efficiency) decreased significantly, but it did not matter whether that additional information was basic program description alone (as in the program-basic condition), supplemental information alone (as in the region-enhanced condition), or both (as in the program-enhanced condition): total lives was essentially the same regardless. Minimal ,onminimal conditions conditions Totallives Equity variance Total programs We obtained complementary results for total programs and equity variance, the two measures of equity, or breadth, of allocation. The total programs to which respondents allocated any funds at all was lowest (which meant that breadth was lowest) in the two minimal conditions (averaging 3.96 programs in the program-minimal condition and 4.00 programs in the region-minimal condition); and total programs was highest (which meant that breadth was highest) in the three nonminimal conditions (averaging 6.37 programs in the program-basic condition, 7.18 in the program-enhanced, and 7.00 in the region-enhanced). The two minimal conditions were significantly lower in total programs than the three nonminimal conditions (using SNK at p < .05). But the two minimal conditions were not significantly different from each other, nor were the nonminimal conditions significantly different from one another. Risk Assessment, Resource Allocation, and Fairness minimal-versus-nonminimal information was a significant factor (p < .001 for each variable). But whether respondents allocated funds to programs versus regions was not a significant factor, nor was there a significant interaction between the two factors. following. Table 3 presents the mean allocations (overall and broken down by condition) for each program. It lists the programs in order of their mean allocations for all conditions combined. With each mean allocation we include in parentheses the program's ranking for that particular column. Each listing briefly references the program description and supplemental information, although each piece of such information would be applicable to only some of the various conditions. Journal of Legal Education lapsed these conditions to conduct a two-factor analysis with minimal-versusnonminimal as one factor and program-versus-region as the other. Because the minimal-versus-nonminimal factor was significant for all but one program (where the factor was still marginally significant), Table 3 also presents separate mean allocations for the combined minimal conditions (i.e., programminimal and region-minimal) versus the combined nonminimal conditions (i.e., program-basic, program-enhanced, and region-enhanced).

As we have noted, for no program was there any significant difference between the program-basic, program-enhanced, and region-enhanced conditions. This finding suggests that the potential effects of information beyond the number of lives saved have limits and that, accordingly, the effects of different types of information are not additive once those limits are reached. If we were not surprised that some limit precludes additive effects of information other than number of lives saved, we were surprised that this ceiling was so low. For example, we would have expected the supplemental information presented alone (i.e., in the region-enhanced condition) to produce a significant difference from program description presented alone (i.e., in the program-basic condition) for at least one of the nine programs, but we never got this result. (To be sure, there were some potential trends in this direction, but none that was significant or even marginally so.) This ceiling on the effects of information beyond number of lives saved points to the relative dominance of lives saved in respondents' allocation. The relative rankings, both overall and across specific conditions and combinations, make it even clearer that the number of lives saved was the dominant Risk Assessment, Resource Allocation, and Fairness factor in the allocations. That dominance is most pronounced in the minimal conditions, of course, where (as predicted) efficiency was highest in the absence of mitigating alternative information. But even though additional information (whether program description, supplemental information, or both) caused a decrease in efficiency and broader allocation, the relative rankings of the various programs remained relatively consistent with the number of lives saved under the programs. Notwithstanding this specific observation, special-interest groups in general do not seem to hurt their own causes, even when their support or opposition is salient; in the region-enhanced condition, the mere fact of special-interest opposition to program 8 reduced allocations to levels far below those in otherwise-identical program 9 Oust as the special-interest opposition would like). Even when the special-interest group is the tobacco industry (i.e., in the program-enhanced condition), allocations were substantially lower for program 8 than for program 9; theyjust were not as low as they were when the interest group was not identified as being the tobacco industry. AIDS, cancer, and political campaigns. Program 1 (AIDS-campaign issue/support), projected to save 12.0 lives per $10 million spent, received the third-highest mean allocation overall, while program 2 (cancer-no supplemental information), with an identical projection of lives saved, received an almost identical fourth-highest allocation. Indeed, within-subjects analyses of the relative allocations between program 1 and program 2 showed no significant differences between those allocations in general. The relative allocations between the two programs did vary significantly both by condition and on the minimal-versus-nonminimal factor; generally, allocations for both programs increased about equally when information was added to the number of lives saved. But there was also a marginally significant interaction effect between the minimal-versus-nonminimal factor and the program-versus-region factor. From the baseline in region-minimal, allocations for program 1 in the regionenhanced condition increased more than allocations for program 2. This makes sense because only program 1 added supplemental information in the region-enhanced condition; any increase in program 2's allocation in that condition would have been due to its interdependence with the other programs, since its description was no different. By contrast, from the baseline in program-minimal, allocations for program 1 in the program-basic and program-enhanced conditions increased less than the allocations for program 2. And program l's allocation in the program-enhanced condition was lower (albeit not significantly) than in the region-enhanced condition. Risk Assessment, Resource Allocation, and Fairness equal between the two programs, it might be that respondents preferred cancer in the nonminimal program conditions because it affects more people; this interpretation would cohere with the preference for breadth and equity. Another explanation might be that these patterns reflect some sort of backlash against AIDS programs. But if the alleged backlash is purportedly due to AIDS' not affecting so many people, then the explanation is simply the complement of the breadth- or equity-based explanation for the relatively higher allocations for cancer programs. And while the decrease in AIDS allocation in the program-enhanced condition (where its campaign visibility is salient) might further support a backlash theory, that decrease was rather small and not significant, and it might simply have reflected the interdependence of the AIDS program and other programs with supplemental information. Journal of Legal Education conditions (where program 3 received allocations that were very slightly but not significantly lower). The superiority of program 3 in the program conditions is consistent with the dominance of lives saved and might also reflect persisting concern about air pollution, while concern about asbestos seems to have waned in the past few years (especially as we have recognized the exorbitant expense but limited benefit of asbestos removal). By contrast, the relative equality of these two programs in the region condition might derive from the salience of program 5's benefiting all schoolchildren (and thus appealing to breadth or equity concerns), especially since program 3 has no supplemental information added. Risk Assessment, Resource Allocation, and Fairness the effects of additional information, so that additional information affects allocations only to a certain point; beyond this point, further information seems to have no effect on allocations. The 1997 Preliminary Survey There is considerable debate not only about differences between experts and ordinary people on the importance of maximizing lives saved, but also about the particular kinds of risks that experts and ordinary people deem important. Consider, for example, the following table:"0 10. See Breyer, supra note 4, at 21 (derived from Environmental Protection Agency, Unfinished Business: A Comparative Asse.sment of Environmental Problerns, (Washington, 1987) and national public opinion polls by the Roper Organization in December 1987 and January 1988).

As a guide to setting government priorities, how important do you consider each of the following risks? Listed below are 24 risks. Please assign each risk to one of three categories (high, medium, or low importance), indicating its seriousness compared with the other risks listed there. Please be sure to assign exactly eight (8) risks (one-third of the total) to each of the three categories. Risk Assessment, Resource Allocation, and Fairness other issues in risk assessment that would need to be addressed and refined with the followup survey. The 1998 survey improved upon the preliminary survey by dividing respondents into two conditions for the risk assessment portion, using a different response format, and offering a guideline definition of risk. For both conditions, the question began with the guideline definition: The level of risk associated with an event or condition is a product of both the magnitude of harm resulting from the event or condition and the probability that the event or condition will occur. The federal, state, and local governments of the United States expend resources against a wide range of environmental, health, and safety risks. the following instruction: Listed below are 24 risks. You have been asked to evaluate the level of risk that each presents. Accordingly, please rank all of the risks from 1 to 24, indicating the level of each risk compared to all the others (1 = highest level of risk on the list, 2 = second-highest level of risk on the list, and so on, to 24 = lowest 11. See the general outline and treatment in Paul Slovic et al., Regulation of Risk A Psychological Perspective, in Regulatory Policy and the Social Sciences, ed. Roger G. Noll, 241 (Berkeley, 1985). level of risk on the list). IMPORTANT: You must use each rank from 1 to 24, and there can be no ties between risks. were instead given this instruction: Listed below are 24 risks. Assume that the government has allotted limited funds thatwill be used to combat eight of the risks listed below. Because these funds are limited, you have been asked to evaluate where they would be best spent. Accordingly, please rank all of the risks from 1 to 24, indicating the spending priority that each risk should receive compared to all the others (1 = highest spending priority on the list, 2 = second-highest spending priority on the list, and so on, to 24 = lowest spending priority on the list). IMPORTANT: You must use each rank from I to 24, and there can be no ties between risks. Table 5 presents the ordinal ranking and mean score for each risk both overall and by condition. (In addition, as noted above, this table includes the ordinal ranking and mean score for each risk as assessed by the 1997 preliminary survey, which used a different response format and scale.)

(The Mann-Whitney U-test is a test of significance that is analogous to a t-test but more appropriate for ordinal data such as the rankings generated by this portion of the survey.) Table 5 highlights significant differences as follows: where the mean scores for a risk were significantly different between conditions (p < .05), the risk has two asterisks; where the difference between conditions was marginally significant (p< .10), the risk has one asterisk. By contrast, five risks showed significant or marginally significant differences in which the mean ranking was higher in the risk level condition than in the funding priority condition: automobile accidents, cigarette smoking (risk to smokers), poor diet/nutrition, indoor air pollution, and occupational injury and illness. What is notable about these five risks is that, unlike the five risks discussed above, these risks can be seen as matters of voluntary behavior and/or contractual relations, and they can be addressed fairly well via insurance arrangements and the tort system. For example, while respondents might see cigarette smoking and poor diet as substantial risks, they might see these risks as being better addressed by behavioral change and/or selfinsurance than by government funding. Similarly, while the respondents might see indoor air pollution and occupational injury or illness as substantial risks, they might see these risks as being better addressed by insurance (including workers' compensation) or even by the tort system than by government funding. On the contrary, the five risks discussed above, with their potential widespread devastation, might be seen as less amenable to solution via behavioral modification, insurance, or the tort system. Journal of Legal Education Variance Variance for each risk was generally similar between conditions, but Levene's test for equality of variances indicated that there were significant or marginally significant differences in variance for five of the risks. For loss of wildlife habitats, indoor air pollution, and pollution of surface waters, variance was higher in the risk level condition than in the funding priority condition. (For pollution of surface waters, this difference was just marginally significant.) Apparently, for these risks, respondents were less consistent in assessing the risk level than they were in assessing the proper funding priority. By contrast, poor diet/nutrition and infectious diseases (excluding AIDS) showed higher variance in the funding priority condition than in the risk level condition (although both of these differences were just marginally significant). For these risks, respondents were less consistent in assessing the proper funding priority than they were in assessing the risk level. Finally, one other interesting observation about variance was that two risks showed overall standard deviations that were significantly different from the average standard deviation (which was 5.55): those risks were cigarette smoking (risk to smokers), with a standard deviation of 7.75, and poor diet/nutrition, with a standard deviation of 7.43. Finally, some of the risks in this portion of the survey matched programs included in the resource allocation portion of the survey. Accordingly, we derived Spearman correlation coefficients for certain pairings of risks in this portion of the survey and programs in the resource allocation portion. (Spearman coefficients were more appropriate than Pearson coefficients because of the ordinal nature of the risk assessment rankings.) We limited this computation to respondents in the program-basic and program-enhanced conditions of the resource allocation portion, because these were the only respondents who knew the nature of the programs when making their allocations. We expected correlations to be negative because, under the 1-to-24 ranking system of the risk assessment portion, greater risks received lower rank scores. Risk Assessment, Resource Allocation, and Fairness plant inspections, between risk rankings for airline accidents and allocations for airline safety inspections, and between risk rankings for particulate air pollution and allocations for programs related to toxic air pollutants. Law students seem to behave more like experts when assessing risk levels themselves. Their assessments are not particularly discordant with those of experts; at the very least, they are more congruent with expert assessments than are the assessments of laypersons. But when asked to establish funding priorities, law students do go beyond assessments of risk alone. Specifically, they apparently attend to factors such as voluntariness, alternative possibilities for addressing the risk aside from government funding, breadth of effect, and effect on children and other innocent parties; and/or they are responsive in their hypothesized roles as policy makers to the concerns of ordinary people, even when those concerns are not matched orjustified by expert assessments of risk levels. The 1997 Preliminary Survey The 1997 preliminary survey included an item presenting the following scenario: "A department store in your town sells snow shovels, usually at a price of $10 per shovel. The morning after a substantial snowstorm, the department store decides to raise the price to $15 per shovel." Respondents were then asked to indicate whether they believed the department store's decision was "completely fair," "acceptable," "unfair," or "very unfair." In most surveys, most people (80 percent or so) treat this decision as unfair. The 1998 survey presented respondents with three scenarios: * The hardware store in your town sells snow shovels, usually at a price of $10 per shovel. The morning after a substantial snowstorm, the hardware store decides to raise the price to $15 per shovel. formula. Tables 6 and 7 present results for the fairness portion of the 1998 survey.

More specifically: looking solely to the 1998 survey, chi-square tests showed that the distribution of responses was significantly dependent on the product for which prices were being increased (p < .01, whether assessed across all four responses or with the responses collapsed into one fair category versus one unfair category). Still more specifically, though, Risk Assessment, Resource Allocation, and Fairness subsequent chi-square tests showed no significant difference between the response pattern for meat and fruit and the response pattern for diapers and baby formula (whether assessed across all four responses or with the responses collapsed into fair versus unfair). But there was a significant difference between the response pattern for snow shovels and the response patterns, collapsed together, for meat and fruit and for diapers and baby formula (p < .01, whether assessed across all four responses or with the responses collapsed). Snow shovels Fruit & meat Diapers & formula Collapsed means for prohibition and subsidy across all products Third, we conducted within-subjects analyses on responses concerning government prohibition of price increases and government subsidies to offset price increases. These analyses revealed no significant difference overall in preference for prohibition versus subsidy. But there was a significant effect of the particular product for which a prohibition or subsidy was in question. Specifically, as with the responses above regarding fairness versus unfairness, subjects were more opposed to either prohibition or subsidy when the product was snow shovels than they were to either prohibition or subsidy when it was fruit and meat or diapers and baby formula. But again, notwithstanding that difference, mean responses leaned toward opposing prohibition or subsidy, regardless of the particular product. Journal of Legal Education the unfairness of the price increase with subsidies rather than prohibiting such price increases.

The preliminary results are intriguing and highly suggestive; but there is much to learn, in particular because of possible distinctive effects arising from the respondents" being enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School, where the economic analysis of law is of substantial importance and emphasis. Further research could provide a great deal of insight into the particular judgments of lawyers, an important group of citizens who take substantial policy-making roles, about how government might make best use of its limited resources in reducing risks to life and health.
