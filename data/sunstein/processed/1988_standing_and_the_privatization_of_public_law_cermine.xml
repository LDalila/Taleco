      <p>It is ironic that during the early period of administrative law,
doctrines controlling regulatory agencies were built directly on
commonlaw principles that administrative regulation was self-consciously
designed to displace.' Not until the 1960s did courts, in concert with
Congress, begin to develop an independent public law-a set of
principles that owed their origin not only to traditional private law, but also
to the ideas that gave rise to administrative regulation in the first
place.2 At their best, the emerging principles revealed an
understanding of the functions and malfunctions of regulation, the potential
dangers of inaction and deregulation as well as overzealous intervention,
the risks and possibilities of judicial control, the appropriate roles of
politics and technical sophistication in the administrative process, and
the extent to which regulatory systems repudiated the premises of
market ordering that had been built into common-law principles. 3</p>
      <p>The last decade has seen preliminary signs of a countermovement,
with courts reorienting administrative law in the direction of ideas that
last appeared in the initial encounters between the judiciary and the
administrative state. 4 Some of those signs have been especially

skepticism toward deterrent suits brought by plaintiffs). The Court has also
reinvigorated separation of powers obstacles to legislative experimentation with the
administrative process, though the recent decisions call into play distinct problems of
congressional usurpation of executive power. See, e.g., Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714

quite tentative innovations in the law of standing have started to push
legal doctrine in the direction of what we may call a private-law model
of standing. Under this model, a nineteenth century private right is a
predicate for judicial intervention; as a result, courts may not redress
the systemic or probabilistic harms that Congress intended regulatory
schemes to prevent.</p>
      <p>Not fully developed until the New Deal, the private-law model
played a large role in legal doctrine between the late 1930s and the
early 1960s. The principal problem with that model-widely
recognized in the 1960s and 1970s-was that it distinguished sharply
between the legal rights of regulated entities on the one hand and those
of regulatory beneficiaries on the other. The interests of regulated
industries could be protected through the courts, whereas the interests of
regulatory beneficiaries were to be vindicated through politics or not at
all.</p>
      <p>The private-law model was correctly repudiated in a series of
developments culminating in the 1970s. While the model is often
justified by reference to the case or controversy requirement of article III,
there is in fact no basis in that article or in any other provision of the
Constitution for the view that the private-law model is constitutional in
status. For purposes of standing, the principal question should be
whether Congress has created a cause of action, through the
Administrative Procedure Act 6 (APA) or otherwise, not whether the plaintiff is
able to invoke a nineteenth century private right.7 If the law were
reoriented in this way, existing doctrine would be greatly simplified; and
a focus on congressional enactments would reveal that the Court's
current approach has resulted in some decisions denying standing when it
Congress did not usurp executive prerogatives). Some of these ideas retain vitality. See

Foolish Inconsistency?, 72 Cornell L. Rev. 488,496-502 (1987) (defending the result in

administrative and constitutional law-mosdy because the APA creates distinctive
standing doctrines for review of agency behavior and partly because efforts to require
administrative agencies to comply with the governing statute raise considerations different
from those raised by efforts to require Congress or the executive branch to comply with

      <p>This Article is organized in three parts. Part I traces the evolution
of modem standing doctrine, outlining its original roots in private law,
the creation of a novel set of standing limitations in response to the
New Deal, and the development of an independent public law of
standing in the 1960s and 1970s. Part II discusses the recent revival of
private law understandings and the principles of separation of powers that
appear to underlie that revival. Part III criticizes the recent
developments, describes the appropriate contours of standing requirements in
administrative law cases, and concludes with a discussion of the
relationship between article III and standing doctrine.</p>
      <p>I. PRIVATE LAW, PUBLIC LAW, AND THE EVOLUTION</p>
      <p>OF STANDING DOCTRINE</p>
      <p>For most of the nation's history, there was no distinctive body of
standing doctrine. Whether there was standing depended on whether
positive law created a cause of action.8 In the modem period, however,
judicial review of administrative action has been an outgrowth of a
simple framework.9 If administrators intruded on interests protected at
common law, judicial review was available to test the question whether
there was statutory authorization for what would otherwise be a
common-law wrong. If no common-law right were at stake, judicial
protection was unavailable. The most distinctive feature of this framework
was the use of common-law understandings to define the judicial role in
public-law cases.</p>
      <p>The basic framework was built on an analogy and an identifiable
underlying theory. The analogy was to private law, in which the issues
of standing, cause of action, and the merits are closely intertwined. In
an action in which A causes an injury to B, the question whether B has a
cause of action overlaps a great deal with the question whether B has
standing and whether B is correct on the merits. For all three issues,
the question is whether A has violated a duty it owes to B. C, an affected
third party, generally may not bring suit when A injures B-even if C is
8. See Berger, Standing to Sue in Public Actions: Is it a Constitutional
Requirement?, 78 Yale LJ. 816, 839 (1969);Jaffe, The Citizen as Litigant in Public Actions: The
Non-Hohfeldian or Ideological Plaintiff, 116 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1033, 1044 (1968); Winter,
The Metaphor of Standing and the Problem of Self-Governance, 40 Stan. L. Rev. 1371,
1395-96 (1988).</p>
      <p>9. The discussion here draws onJ. Vining, supra note 1; Stewart, supra note 1. The
tradition of prerogative writs-most notably mandamus-provided a different
framework, one that allowed a variety of actions when no common-law right was at stake. See
infra note 19. The existence of the writ tradition, especially at the origin of the republic,
makes it extremely awkward to suggest that modern notions of injury in fact, see infra
notes 52-55 and accompanying text, have constitutional status. See Berger, supra note
8; Jaffe, supra note 8; Winter, supra note 8.
materially affected. 10 At private law, there is no need for a distinctive
set of principles to govern standing.</p>
      <p>In the early period of administrative regulation, similar ideas were
at work in public law. II A prospective litigant could not bring suit if the
government had regulated, or failed to regulate, some entity, even if
the interests of the prospective litigant had been substantially and
materially affected. At both private and public law, the question was not
whether the litigant was harmed or whether the governmental or
nongovernmental defendant acted unlawfully, but whether the government
breached some duty owed to the litigant. If the litigant had no
common-law interest at stake-if it was not the "object" of the
regulation 12 -courts saw no legal duty suitable for legal redress. Illegality in
the abstract was not an appropriate concern of the courts. Since the
line between legal injury and injury in the abstract was defined by
reference to the common law, the interests of statutory beneficiaries were
invisible as far as the courts were concerned.</p>
      <p>The underlying theory was based on notions of social contract.
When citizens entered into civil society from the state of nature, they
did so with certain rights.' 3 The state could not interfere with those
rights except on a showing of collective authorization for the
interference-legislative action combined with proper executive
implementation. The relevant category of interests consisted of the rights of
private property and liberty that had existed in the state of nature. If
no such interest was at stake, there was simply no predicate for legal
intervention. Common-law interests, or traditional private rights, were
thus sharply distinguished from statutory benefits for purposes of
standing.</p>
      <p>It should be unsurprising that this framework operated at the same
time as-indeed was a part of-the set of ideas associated with the
Lochner era.1 4 When the Supreme Court invalidated social and
economic regulation associated with the progressive and New Deal
periods, it did so by invoking common-law categories in order to test the
10. An exception is the third-party beneficiary doctrine in contract law. See E.
Farnsworth, Contracts ยง 10.5 (1982).</p>
      <p>11. Inroads on the framework began in The Chicago Junction Case, 264 U.S. 258
(1924) (allowing standing for competing carriers to challenge acquisition approval by
ICC), though the private-law understanding played a large role until the 1960s. See
infra notes 26-67 and accompanying text.</p>
      <p>12. The understanding of who is an object of regulation turns on an antecedent
baseline-the nineteenth century common law-establishing the ordinary or natural
functions of government. Under an alternative baseline, however, any beneficiary left
unprotected by government might be treated as an object of the inadequate protection.
See Sunstein, Lochner's Legacy, 87 Colum. L. Rev. 873 (1987) (discussing role of
baselines in standing and other areas of public law); infra notes 61-63 and accompanying
text. For a defense of the old view, see Scalia, supra note 5, at 887 &amp; n.28.

validity of public law. 15 Intrusions on common-law interests, or
departures from common-law principles, were thought to require special
justification; by contrast, adherence to the common law was seen as
unobjectionable neutrality. The use of common-law notions, sharply
distinguishing between statutory benefits and nineteenth century
private rights, was the central mark of the jurisprudence of the Lochner
1 6
period.</p>
      <p>In the context of standing, this view had two principal implications.
First, regulated entities-industries and others who were the object of
regulation-had access to court to challenge agency action as
unlawfully infringing on their common-law rights. In such cases, there was
no problem of standing. Regulated entities were usually in the position
of actual or prospective defendants, and there was little doubt that
defendants had standing to resist coercive governmental action-a view
with constitutional foundations.1 7 Second, the interests of competitors
and regulatory beneficiaries1 8 were not legally cognizable. t 9 Those
interests, treated as privileges or legal gratuities, were to be vindicated
through the political process or not at all. We may describe the
resulting framework-an ambiguous amalgam of federal common law,
statutory construction, and constitutional law-as a private-law model of
public law.</p>
      <p>Another, quite different idea was at work here as well. Many
judges who were hospitable toward administrative regulation sought to
develop devices to minimize legal or judicial intrusions into the
regula15. See generally L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law ยง 1-3, at 5, ยง 1-4, at 76-77
(2d ed. 1988) (describing the Lochner-era"belief that property and its contractually
realizable advantages were attributable to some natural order to things implicit in a revealed
structure of common-law rights"); Sunstein, supra note 12, at 879 (common law formed
"baseline from which to measure deviations from neutrality, or self-interested 'deals' ").

      <p>18. Competitors and beneficiaries were considered to be "bystanders," an idea that
depended on an assortment ofunarticulated substantive conclusions. But the
characterization of a claim as that of a bystander operates as a conclusion or an epithet rather
than as an analytical device. There is no prepolitical or prelegal way to decide who is a
bystander; the term is a function of law, not of anything in the world that is independent
of the legal system. See Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 373 (1982)
(indicating that statute may create an injury where none existed before).</p>
      <p>19. See, e.g., Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, 302 U.S. 464, 479-80 (1938)
(competitors). An exception here can be found in the law of mandamus. As a historical matter,
mandamus remedies quite generally permitted suits to compel government action. See
L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 468-69 (1965). But the Supreme
Court ruled in an early case that federal courts do not have general authority to issue
writs of mandamus, McIntire v. Wood, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 503, 504 (1813), and in any
case, mandamus could not control discretionary decisions. See Wilbur v. United States
ex rel. Kudrie, 281 U.S. 206, 218 (1930);Jarrett v. Resor, 426 F.2d 213, 216 (9th Cir.
1970). Note, however, that such rulings were interpretations of positive law, and
therefore of congressional intent, not of article III.
tory process. 2 0 This development was a conspicuous part of the New
Deal attack on legalism and the judiciary. That attack had substantive
and institutional dimensions. The substantive dimension consisted of a
belief that the nineteenth century catalogue of common-law rights was
hardly natural; instead, it was a controversial regulatory system. In the
view of the New Deal reformers, the common law was inadequate as
such because it was excessively protective of property rights,
insufficiently protective of the disadvantaged, and ill-adapted to economic
welfare in an integrated national economy. 2 1 The institutional
dimension consisted of an attack on the judicial system in favor of regulatory
agencies, which were to be democratically controlled, technically
expert, self-starting, and free of the traditional constraints of
adjudication. Taken in concert, these ideas provided much of the impetus for
administrative regulation. 2 2</p>
      <p>Against this background, courts favorably disposed toward the
New Deal reformation developed doctrines of standing, ripeness, and
reviewability largely to insulate agency decisions from judicial
intervention. 23 Such doctrines were used enthusiastically by judges associated
with the progressive movement and the New Deal, most prominently
Justices Brandeis and Frankfurter, who reflected the prevailing belief
that traditional conceptions of the rule of law were incompatible with
administrative regulation. 24 In this view, the interests supporting the

(1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (upholding agency action by denying standing in
part because challenged action was not final); Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Auth., 297
U.S. 288, 341-45 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (upholding agency's dealings with
corporation by denying standing to corporate stockholders); cf. Fairchild v. Hughes, 258
U.S. 126, 129-30 (1922) (dismissing prospective challenge to constitutional amendment
and its enforcement by attorney general, by denying standing to plaintiff); Wilson v.
Shaw, 204 U.S. 24, 30-31 (1907) (upholding agency action, in part because injunctive
relief is inappropriate remedy to protect citizen against wrongful government act).
Notably, in McGrath,Ashwander, and other cases, a majority of the Supreme Court rejected
the Brandeis-Frankfurter position and allowed standing in cases that plausibly amounted
to taxpayer suits. These and other aspects of the development of standing limitations
are illuminatingly discussed in Winter, supra note 8.</p>
      <p>One of the most influential achievements of A. Bickel, The Least Dangerous Branch
(1962), was to generalize the Brandeis-Frankfurter position on standing, to remove it
from its context, and to give it a life entirely independent of New Deal concerns. Id. at

U.S. 1 (1948), Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), and West Coast Hotel v.
Parrish, 300 U.S. 379 (1937)-all of which recognized that the common law is a
regulatory system and hardly prepolitical.</p>

(1940) (reviewability); Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 303 U.S. 41 (1938)

rise of regulation-technocratic expertise, flexibility, and political
accountability-argued strongly against judicial interference. 2 5 This view
has enjoyed a kind of renaissance in recent years, though from judges
with a quite different political orientation.</p>
      <p>The private-law model of standing thus reflected a confluence of
two sets of ideas, both closely associated with the Lochner era and the
New Deal attack on the jurisprudence of Lochner. The first, prominent
in Lochner itself, was that the judiciary existed largely to protect
common-law interests from governmental incursions. The common law
formed the baseline from which courts distinguished between
government inaction and action or neutrality and partisanship. For this
reason, intrusions on common-law rights, and not on other sorts of
interests, served to trigger judicial protection. The second idea-a
reaction against Lochner on the part of those hospitable to the
administrative state-was that doctrines of justiciability, including standing,
should be designed to minimize the occasions for judicial intervention
into the regulatory process.</p>
      <p>The advocates ofjudicial control, hostile to administrative
regulation, saw no need for judicial intervention in order to safeguard the
interest in regulatory protection. And in light of the recent history,
those favorable to regulation were highly suspicious of the courts. The
idea that courts might intervene to protect regulatory beneficiaries
from a recalcitrant agency was entirely foreign to their experience. As a
result, there was mutual agreement on the private-law model from
those who believed in the need for a continuing role for the legal
system in supervising administrative regulation, and those who thought
that adjudicative controls were to a large degree anachronistic. The
consequence of the convergence of these ideas was that those without a
common-law interest were unable to seek judicial relief. At the time, it
was unclear whether this framework was rooted in federal common law
or statutory construction-or instead whether it amounted to a largely
revisionist reading of article 111.26</p>
      <p>In two basic steps, courts abandoned this model. The first was the
conclusion that interests protected by statute were also judicially
cognizable.2 7 If the interest of a prospective litigant in freedom from
compeinadequate as regulatory scheme); Sunstein, supra note 21, at 440-42 (describing New
Deal attack on common law and on traditional notions of separation of powers); Winter,

protect legislative sphere); supra note 20 (same).</p>

      <p>26. See Winter, supra note 8, at 1394-96 (original conception of article III did not
limit standing to those with common-law injuries); infra notes 205-32 and
accompanying text.</p>
      <p>27. See The Chicago Junction Case, 264 U.S. 258, 262-69 (1924) (allowing
standing based on provisions of Transportation Act and Judicial Code). It may have been
thought here that competition among the objects of regulation, including monitoring of
compliance with regulation, would ultimately serve to protect the public as a whole.
tition was a factor made relevant by the governing statute-if the
agency was required by law to take that factor into account in deciding
the merits-the litigant would have access to court in order to vindicate
its interest.28 In such a case, the litigant would not have to show that a
common-law interest was at stake.</p>
      <p>The second step was the recognition of "surrogate standing," by
which Congress could allow certain plaintiffs to bring suit to vindicate
the claims of the public at large even though they did not themselves
have a statutorily protected interest. This principle applied when an
organic statute granted standing to anyone "who is aggrieved or whose
interests are adversely affected." 2 9 Thus, for example, competitors of a
radio station would have standing to protect the interests of listeners
under the FCC statute.3 0</p>
      <p>Under this framework, it was not always necessary for Congress
expressly to confer a right to bring suit on the plaintiff. The existence
of an interest protected by statute was sufficient. Courts treated the
congressional desire to protect a statutory interest as an implicit grant
of a right to bring suit. The requirements for an implicit cause of
action were thus quite lenient.31</p>
      <p>Moreover, the existence of an interest protected at common law
was sufficient to confer standing, even if there was no particular
evidence of congressional intent to allow the action to go forward. This
conclusion reflected a background understanding, not traceable to
statute, that the objects of regulation should ordinarily be permitted to
raise the question whether there was legal authorization for intrusion
on common-law interests. This understanding, part of the private-law
model and emphasized in the New Deal period, was probably a product
of a constitutional concern. If those seen as the objects of regulation
were prohibited from seeking judicial review to protect liberty or

may be possible to explain this difference in standards by reference to the nature of the
remedies being sought. Suits brought under the APA attempt to nullify administrative
action; implied causes of action are frequently damage actions. This explanation fits
well with Transamerica, in which the Court implied an equitable remedy for rescission,
but refused to permit a damage action to go forward. Transamerica,444 U.S. at 18-24.

constitutional question would be raised under both the due process clause and</p>
      <p>In contrast, no similar question was thought to be raised by a
measure preventing statutory beneficiaries from seeking judicial relief.
Their interests were legal gratuities."3 In the modern period, however,
serious constitutional problems might also be raised by congressional
efforts to deny standing to those seeking governmental assistance in
preventing illegality by third parties.3 4</p>
      <p>Despite these complications, there was in this period a close
association between the existence of an implied cause of action and the
existence of standing. The question of standing turned on whether
Congress had explicitly or implicitly granted the plaintiff a right to
bring suit, at least if the notion of implicit grant is understood with the
foregoing qualifications.35 That question was in turn informed largely
by background understandings about the circumstances in which
judicial relief should be available.</p>
      <p>In 1946, Congress codified the various bases for standing outlined
above in section 702 of the APA: "A person suffering legal wrong
because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency
action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial
review thereof."a The reference to legal wrong was meant to include

      <p>34. See infra note 222 and accompanying text. In the modem period, the
distinction between the objects and beneficiaries of regulation has become problematic and
largely anachronistic. See infra notes 62-63 and accompanying text. In this respect, the
constitutional questions raised by a denial ofjudicial review and a denial of standing are
quite similar. See Fallon, supra note 32, at 963-67; cf. Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co.,
455 U.S. 422, 430-31 (1982) (discussing "new property" cases putting statutory benefits
on the same footing as common-law interests). Consider also the idea that under
modem law, a "separate indication of congressional intent to make agency action reviewable
under the APA is not necessary; instead, the rule is that the cause ofaction for review of
such action is available absent some clear and convincing evidence of legislative
intention to preclude review." Japan Whaling Ass'n v. American Cetacean Soc'y, 478 U.S.

      <p>A central flaw in Hart, supra note 32, is its dependence on an anachronistic
distinction between coercive and noncoercive governmental action. Id. at 1383. Hart suggests
that whether there is a constitutional right to judicial review depends on whether or not
the government is acting coercively, and he defines coercion by reference to
commonlaw categories. Id. at 1387-1401. But in the post-New Deal era, such ideas cannot be
sustained. Indeed, reliance on pre-New Deal understandings of legal rights pervades
Hart's dialogue.</p>

      <p>36. 5 U.S.C. ยง 702 (1982). It is incorrect to interpret the APA as incorporating an
harm to common-law, statutory, and constitutional interests; in the
setting of administrative law, the first two were by far the most important.
The "adversely affected or aggrieved" language was designed to allow
for surrogate standing if the organic statute provided such standing. 37
There was no clear indication, in the text or history of the APA,
whether and when the beneficiaries of regulation might have standing
to vindicate legal requirements 3 8-though they too could easily be
thought to suffer from a legal injury in the form of harm to their
statutorily protected interests.</p>
      <p>In the 1960s, courts interpreted the statutorily protected interest
aspect of the legal-wrong test in order to reach precisely this
concluinjury-in-fact standard like that subsequently adopted in Association of Data Processing
Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 152-53 (1970). The text and history of the APA
suggest that it was intended instead to incorporate the framework deicribed above,
supra text accompanying notes 27-35. For this reason, the treatment in Davis, The
Liberalized Law of Standing, 37 U. Chi. L. Rev. 450, 452-53 (1970), is off the mark.</p>
      <p>37. The legislative history of the APA is not clear, but it tends to confirm this
reading.</p>
      <p>The phrase "legal wrong" means such a wrong as is specified in section 10(e).
It means that something more than mere adverse personal effect must be
shown in order to prevail-that is, that the adverse effect must be an illegal
effect. Almost any governmental action may adversely affect somebody-as
where rates or prices are fixed-but a complainant, in order to prevail, must
show that the action is contrary to law in either substance or procedure.

Doc. No. 248, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 276 (1946) [hereinafter APA Leg. History]. It is
notable in this regard that the drafters of the APA expressly conflate the issue of
standing with the merits. Id. at 212; see also id. at 368-69 (agencies "may not willfully act or
refuse to act .... They may not take affirmative action or negative action without the
factual basis required by the laws under which they are proceeding .... Legal wrong
means action or inaction in violation of the law or the facts."); id. at 308-11 (noting that
the "adjective 'legal' is a limiting adjective").</p>
      <p>Consider also the analysis in the highly influential report of the Attorney General's
Committee on Administrative Procedure:</p>
      <p>The standing may be conferred by statute; but it frequently is not so conferred
in specific terms. The question is then whether the person has otherwise a
private right not to have the administrative body act in the allegedly unlawful
manner.... Whether a particular person shall have the right to contest
administrative action ... is a question of law and policy dependent on a number of
variable factors. Consideration, though not conclusive, has been given, for
example, to the nature and extent of the person's interest, and the character of
the administrative act, whether it commands conduct by the person, permits
conduct by his rival, withholds a service or benefit which the Government is
free to withhold, and so forth.... Except in special cases, when special
considerations require a contrary holding,judicial review within the usuallimits is
appropriate whether the applicant seeks protection of a constitutionalright or of a statutory or
common-law right, privilege, or bounty.</p>

sion, allowing regulatory beneficiaries to vindicate claims of
administrative illegality. Thus, for example, viewers of television, victims of
housing discrimination, and users of the environment were able to
bring suit because their interests were statutorily protected.3 9 This
conclusion was a natural and unsurprising interpretation of the
legalwrong test, since beneficiaries, at least as clearly as competitors, were
intended to be protected by regulatory statutes.40 Here too there was a
connection between the question of standing and the existence of an
implied cause of action; the existence of a statutorily protected interest
was thought to create a legal wrong under the APA. 4 1 The existence of
a common-law interest became a sufficient but not a necessary
condition for legal protection.4 2 Eventually, the law no longer distinguished
sharply between the interests of regulatory beneficiaries and those of
regulated industries.</p>
      <p>The shift of the 1960s and 1970s was attributable to a general
consensus that, from the standpoint of the New Deal period, was quite
puzzling. According to the emerging view, a belief in the rule of law was
entirely compatible with a system of administrative regulation. Legal
controls on regulatory agencies seemed well adapted to or even
necessary for the successful implementation of statutory programs. Judges
and others who rejected common-law baselines in general were thus
well disposed toward legal intervention. In their rejection of the use of</p>
      <p>40. See cases cited supra note 39.</p>
      <p>41. Without the APA, this conclusion might have been controversial. The existence
of an interest protected by statute need not imply a correlative right to bring an action to
vindicate that interest. Some of the recent cases involving implied causes ofaction make
this point dear. See cases cited supra note 31.</p>
      <p>42. The development of the law here thus replicated the shifting definition of
liberty and property interests during the same period. Originally those interests were
defined by reference to the common law. In the late 1960s and 1970s, however, statutorily
protected interests assumed constitutional status. See Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S.
593, 599-603 (1972) (professor's interest in position under de facto tenure program is
property interest); Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 260-66 (1970) (due process
requires that welfare recipient be afforded evidentiary hearing before benefits can be
terminated). Here too, courts made inroads on a private-law model of public law, and for
many of the same reasons. The distinction between common-law and statutory interests
does, however, persist in other areas of the law. See Commodity Futures Trading
Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 854 (1986) (noting that existence of interest protected
at common law is relevant to availability of article III tribunal); Comment, Sovereign
Immunity and Entitlement Benefits, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. (forthcoming 1989) (discussing
relevance of common-law interest in sovereign immunity doctrine).
common-law baselines in the law of standing,4 3 they were conforming
to the understandings that gave rise to regulation in the first place; but
the new synthesis reflected a firm rejection of the New Deal belief in an
inevitable disjunction between the realm of law and the realm of
administrative government. The consequence Was that judicial checks
became a significant part of the network of controls on administrative
behavior, controls that were designed to promote as well as to check
regulatory intervention. 44</p>
      <p>Three particular ideas played a role in this shift. The first was an
understanding that congressional purposes could be defeated not only
by overzealous regulation, but also by unlawful failure to regulate or
agency hostility to statutory programs. 45 If conformity to law was a
goal of administrative law, there was no reason to distinguish between
the beneficiaries and the targets of regulation. Far from being
incompatible with the administrative process, some measure ofjudicial
supervision appeared to be a means of promoting agency fidelity to statutory
purposes.</p>
      <p>The second idea derived from widespread (though not monolithic)
evidence of the influence of regulated industries over regulatory
programs.4 6 In the face of such evidence, it was most peculiar to suggest
that regulated industries, and not regulatory beneficiaries, should have
access to court. Political remedies were no more obviously available to
regulatory beneficiaries than to regulated entities; indeed, the
beneficiaries faced especially severe problems of political organization. 4 7 If
an agency failed to implement a statutory program to the legally
required degree, it was often unrealistic to expect the political process to
provide relief. In any case, the possible availability of political remedies
was not thought to be a reason to deny standing to regulated entities.
In both cases, judicial review was a means of promoting agency
conformity to the commands of the legislative process.</p>
      <p>The final idea was that from the standpoint of the legal system, the
claims of regulatory beneficiaries were of no less importance than those
of regulated industries. The interests of victims of discrimination,
pollution, unfair labor practices, securities fraud, and other statutory
harms seemed no less deserving of legal protection than the
commonlaw interests that had served as the traditional predicate for judicial
review. This conclusion was a natural-indeed inevitable- outgrowth of
the New Deal, which arose from a belief that the common-law catalogue
of interests was inadequate.48</p>
      <p>The conclusion that statutory and common-law interests should
not be sharply distinguished seemed irresistible if importance was
assessed by reference to the beliefs of Congress, which, after all, created
the statutory programs. The limitation of standing to those having
traditional common-law interests at stake appeared to depend on an
anachronistic conception of legal rights traceable above all to the
discredited jurisprudence of Lochner v. New York. 4 9 The attack on
common-law baselines thus merged with an attack on the belief that
administrative autonomy was the most promising institutional
mechanism for producing the appropriate level of regulatory control.</p>
      <p>It would have been possible for courts to use these ideas to build
on the legal-wrong test in such a way as to grant statutory beneficiaries
broad standing to bring suit. Because regulatory programs quite
generally, and indeed by definition, reflect a desire to protect beneficiaries,
allegations of inadequate regulatory action might always be thought to
create a liegal wrong, and therefore standing, within the meaning of the

Stewart, supra note 1, at 1684-87. A particular difficulty here stems from the
collectiveaction problems that impose severe transaction-cost barriers to organization on the part
of beneficiaries. See R. Hardin, Collective Action 53-54 (1982); M.Olson, The Logic of
Collective Action 22 (1971).</p>

in Scalia, supra note 5, at 894, which argues that standing should be limited to those
who have at stake "individual rights." See infra notes 182-88 and accompanying text.
APA. 50 This conclusion, in fact reached in many lower court decisions
in the 1960s, 51 would have had the advantage of promoting fidelity to
the text and purposes of the governing provision of the APA. It would
also have tied the problem of standing to the question whether
Congress had explicitly or implicitly conferred on plaintiffs a right to bring
suit.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court, however, took a different route to the
revision of standing doctrine. In its decision in Association of Data Processing
Service Organizationsv. Camp,5 2 the Court abandoned the previous
framework altogether, signalling a significant departure from the private-law
underpinnings of previous law. The Court replaced the legal interest
test with a factual inquiry into the existence of harm; the existence of a
"legal" interest was utterly irrelevant. 53 What was relevant was
whether there was an injury in fact that was "arguably within the zone"
of interests protected by the statutory or constitutional provision at
issue.5 4 The Court therefore interpreted the APA to grant standing even
if the particular substantive statute did not confer on plaintiffs a right to
bring suit and indeed even if there was no legal interest at all.5 5</p>
      <p>The "arguably within the zone of interests" requirement
responded to some of the same concerns as the legal-interest test, and it
too called for a degree of entanglement between standing and the
merits; but the requirement was, by design, quite lenient, and involved only
a brief examination of the statute to see if the plaintiff's interests were
entirely far afield from the statutory purposes. 56 Notably, however,
Data Processingwas styled as an interpretation of the APA. As such, it
50. There is evidence that those responsible for the APA contemplated standing on
the part of regulatory beneficiaries. The influential and contemporaneous Attorney
General's Committee noted that judicial review "is adapted chiefly to curbing excess of
power, not toward compelling its exercise." Att'y Gen. Rep., supra note 37, at 76. But
it added that "if the denial[ofaction]is based on an erroneousinterpretationof law,judicialreview
is available to remove at least that barrier." Id. at 86; see also supra note 37 (legislative
history of APA). Note also that the APA defines "agency action" to include "failure to
act," 5 U.S.C. ยง 551(13)(1982), and authorizes courts to "compel agency action
unlawfully withheld or unnecessarily delayed," Id. ยง 706(1). The contrary position is
presented in Scalia, supra note 5, at 887-88, but the position is insufficiently attentive to
the context and history of the APA. Cf. Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 828-35 (1985)

for failure to meet the "arguably within the zone" test.
was incorrect; 57 but in actual effect, it could be interpreted so as not to
depart substantially from the original APA framework. 58</p>
      <p>Data Processingresponded to a belief that the private-law model no
longer worked in public-law cases. 59 Why this is so is a complex
matter.6 0 A principal reason was that the private-law inquiry into whether
A has violated a duty owed to B does not quite capture the dynamics of
public-law cases, in which disputes cannot so readily be understood in
terms of clear rights and duties. Often administrative disputes do not
have a bipolar structure: there may be many people on one or both
sides of the dispute, and the agency may be authorized to consider
numerous factors, no one of which is controlling. Since a number of
factors are relevant, and none decisive, the right-duty relationship
between the government and any particular legal complainant is not
crisp and bilateral. It is important not to overstate this point. In
public-law cases, there are rights and duties too. The failure to consider a
relevant factor, or the consideration of an irrelevant factor, might well
be thought of as a breach of a legal duty owed by the government to the
complainant. But the inquiry into consideration of relevant factors
does not have a clear parallel in private-law actions.</p>
      <p>Moreover, once public-law plaintiffs are authorized to appear in
court, they do not argue that the government has breached a duty owed
to them-at least not in the common-law sense-but instead that the
government has behaved unlawfully. 61 In this respect, public law has
for a long time split the question of standing and the merits.</p>
      <p>Even under Data Processing, there remained a bow in the direction
of dispute-settlement, for the requirement of an injury in fact
eliminated those plaintiffs with purely ideological claims. 62 But the Court
moved dramatically in the direction of a standing doctrine that no
57. See Currie, supra note 35, at 43-44 (contrasting standing grant in Data
Processing with grant implied by legislative history of APA); supra notes 36-37 and
accompanying text (legislative history of APA).</p>
      <p>58. This is because the injury-in-fact test was designed and interpreted largely so as
to allow standing, not for all those "affected," but for competitors and regulatory
beneficiaries. This test in substance replicated the expansion of the legally protected interest
model in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which built on the legal-wrong standard
repudiated in Data Processing. See supra notes 38-42 and accompanying text.
59. See J. Vining, supra note 1, at 39-40.
60. See id. at 171 ("We do not know how a value becomes a public value.").
61. See id. at 142; cf. Duke Power Co.v. Carolina Envtl. Study Group, 438 U.S. 59,
78-79 (1978) (plaintiffs need not show a nexus between injury to them and intended
scope of constitutional right at stake). There are, however, prudential limitations on the
ability of one person to raise the interests of another. See generally Monaghan, Third
Party Standing, 84 Colum. L. Rev. 277 (1984) (discussing the expansion and
problematic nature of discretionary judicial limitations on third-party standing doctrine).</p>
      <p>62. Here as elsewhere a standard is necessary to explain what a purely ideological
claim is. There is no prelegal category of ideological claims; to say that a claim is
ideological is to say that no legal right is at stake. That question will depend in turn on the
substantive law. See infra notes 205-32 and accompanying text (discussing article III).
longer owed its shape to common-law categories, or distinguished
between the rights of regulated entities and regulatory beneficiaries.</p>
      <p>Indeed-and this is the central point-that very distinction
depended on a conceptual foundation that had become anachronistic
precisely because it was dependent on common-law baselines. Whether
someone is the object of regulation or its beneficiary cannot be decided
without an independent theory outlining what it is that-govemment
ordinarily or properly does. Regulated entities are themselves the
beneficiaries of statutory limits on agency power-and of the common
lawinsofar as those sources of law protect them from public or private
incursions into their legally created spheres. The beneficiaries are the
objects of regulation insofar as positive law authorizes such intrusions
and affords them less protection from private conduct than they would
like.63 Indeed, the very term "statutory beneficiary," as conventionally
used, assumes that the common law is the ordinary backdrop or the
usual state of affairs, and that departures from that state should be
understood as providing special benefits and special burdens. It is not
surprising that assumptions of this sort became impossible to sustain in
the wake of the New Deal attack on the common law.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding these considerations, the Data Processingdecision
was justifiably subject to powerful criticism. 64 First, an effort to build
on the legal-wrong standard probably would have been superior to the
injury-in-fact approach. All of the foregoing ideas could have been
accommodated within the legal-wrong standard. That standard
accurately captures the original meaning of the APA, and it has the further
advantage of deriving standing doctrine from congressional purposes
in enacting regulatory legislation.65 The legal-wrong test also has the
significant virtue of dissolving the distinction between beneficiaries and
regulated entities by making it clear that statutes provide the only
workable metric for deciding whether there is a judicially cognizable injury.
Whether there is such an injury cannot be decided in the abstract,
without regard to what the law provides. The legal-wrong test does not
build into the inquiry a distinct, extralegal category of beneficiaries. In
this respect, it was the injury-in-fact test that was anachronistic,
precisely because it suggested that there was a prelegal category of
injuries-a point that has turned out to have considerable importance. 66
In addition, and more generally, the injury-in-fact requirement
it63. SeeJ. Vining, supra note 1, at 102-03.</p>
      <p>64. See Stewart, Book Review, 88 Yale LJ. 1559, 1569 (1979) (describing Data
Processingas an "unredeemed disaster").</p>
      <p>65. See supra notes 34-35 and accompanying text; see also Currie, supra note 35,
at 43-44 (describing legal-wrong test in original understanding of APA); Stewart, supra
note 64, at 1569 (characterizing legal-wrong standard as providing "ample flexibility for
recognition of emerging societal interests through judicial expansion of the statutorily
protected-interest test").</p>
      <p>66. See infra notes 88-136 and accompanying text.
self was criticized as a holdover from private-law ideas from which Data
Processinghad to some degree escaped. 6 7 That requirement, and
standing limitations generally, are often quite sensible,68 but they have been
justified on the basis of policies that actually have little or nothing to do
with standing at all. Standing limitations are said to ensure that
lawsuits are concrete rather than hypothetical or remote.69 But the
injuryin-fact requirement and other limitations on standing do not promote
concreteness; indeed, the problem of concreteness has nothing to do
with the question of standing. Whether a plaintiff is able to point to an
injury peculiar to him is a question independent of the concreteness or
abstraction of the dispute. For example, the dispute in Sierra Club v.
Morton 7 0-the principal modem example of a case denying standing on
injury-in-fact grounds-was hardly hypothetical or remote.7 1 Standing
limitations are also said to be a way of ensuring sincere or effective
advocacy. 7 2 But institutional litigants not having injury in fact are
particularly likely to be strong advocates. 7" It is expensive to initiate a
lawsuit, and those who do so without meeting the standing requirements
are especially committed. 74</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding these problems, the Data Processingapproach
appeared for a long time to generate a body of standing doctrine that had
a large measure of coherence, at least under the APA.7 5 As the law
developed, courts did not sharply distinguish between statutory
beneficiaries and regulated class members, thus largely eliminating the
asymmetry built into previous law.7 6 This development served to remove a
skewed set of incentives for administrators who, under the previous
regime, could be subject to a lawsuit in the event of overzealous
enforcement action, but would be immunized from legal controls if they
furnished insufficient protection. 77 There is powerful evidence that the
recognition of standing for regulatory beneficiaries has been important
in bringing about agency compliance with law. 78 At the same time, the
doctrine has excluded merely ideological interests and the interest in
law enforcement for its own sake. 79</p>
      <p>A principal goal of the Data Processingapproach was to achieve a
large degree of clarity and predictability. And for a period, the
injuryin-fact requirement seemed to operate in a reasonably straightforward
fashion. It should be clear, however, that an assessment of whether the
plaintiff has suffered injury in fact could not be the only question for
purposes of standing. In an integrated economy, an enormously wide
variety of people are affected by an agency's decision to act or not to
75. SeeJ. Vining, supra note 1, at 39-42.</p>
      <p>76. Some asymmetry remains, however, since scarce prosecutorial resources
provide a legitimate reason for agency inaction. The fact that agencies must allocate their
limited resources to those problems that seem most pressing, however, has implications
for reviewability rather than for standing. See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 831
(1985); Sunstein, Reviewing Agency Inaction After Heckler. v. Chaney, 52 U. Chi. L.
Rev. 653, 683 (1985).</p>
      <p>77. Congress has recognized this risk and expressly granted rights to beneficiaries

act.8 0 The decision of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
whether a particular company violated an environmental statute, and
should face civil and criminal penalties, will have consequences "in
fact" for workers and employers in many other companies as well-not
to mention consumers generally.</p>
      <p>In Data Processing,the Court could not have meant to suggest that
all affected workers, employers, and consumers could challenge all EPA
decisions. In order to produce sensible results, courts had to build into
the new framework some distinction between direct and indirect
consequences of agency decisions, or between legally cognizable injuries and
harms that Congress could not have intended to be vindicated in
court.8 1 In this sense, the injury-in-fact test was (and is) quite
malleable, and the standing determination inevitably depends on a range of
considerations that the notion of injury in fact, by itself, cannot capture.</p>
      <p>In these circumstances, the "arguably within the zone" test,
though appearing unwieldy, served in practice as a lenient and
workable threshold inquiry, capturing the understanding that those whose
interests were entirely afield of statutory purposes could not bring suit.
The test thus operated as a check against suits brought by people with
interests unrelated to the statutory scheme.8 2 And the injury-in-fact
test itself, in its early period, appeared to allow suits by regulatory
beneficiaries and by adversely affected competitors, but not to allow
standing for those whose interests were only indirectly and incidentally
affected.8 3 Thus, the new standing doctrine seemed as if it might serve
the function, intended by the Court in Data Processing, of ensuring that
jurisdictional inquiries were reasonably simple and crisp,8 4 and did not
unduly complicate the case before courts reached the merits.</p>
      <p>Data Processing was part of a set of developments that began to
point the way toward an independent public law.8 5 Such developments

[i]n cases where the plaintiff is not itself the subject of the contested regulatory
action, the test denies a right of review if the plaintiff's interests are so
marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it
cannot be reasonably assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.

tory beneficiaries to require greater regulatory protection attempt to
vindicate injuries that ought to be cognizable politically but not
through the judiciary. There is in this respect a clear connection
between the causation requirements and certain conceptions of judicial
restraint and separation of powers. The recent cases might be
understood as an effort to narrow the judicial role in actions brought by
statutory beneficiaries-often having numerous members-to compel
government action against private parties. The causation requirements
are one of several devices by which to accomplish this goal. 144</p>
      <p>The underlying concern, captured in Allen v. Wright,14 5 is that while
courts should protect the objects of regulation, they should be
reluctant to compel the executive branch to undertake enforcement action
to vindicate the general or societal interests of regulatory beneficiaries.
In this view, suits brought to challenge "the particular programs
agencies establish to carry out their legal obligations"1 4 6 should not
bejudicially cognizable. The distinctive judicial role is the protection of
traditional or individual rights against governmental overreaching. 147
This claim purports to derive strength from the constitutional
provision, invoked in this way in Allen and another recent decision of the
Court, 148 that confers on the President, not the judiciary, the authority
to "take Care that the laws be faithfully executed."' 49</p>
      <p>The recent standing requirements belong in the same category as
other recent decisions restricting judicial intrusions into
administration, with respect to both substance' 5 0 and procedure.i 5 1 They reflect
a form of judicial skepticism about both government regulation and
court entanglement in executive functions. The congruence of these
kinds of skepticism has been critical in the cases. The two have been
combined in no other recent period. 152</p>
      <p>There is a commonality between the New Deal approach and still
tentative developments in current law, and it lies in the belief that
administrative regulation, grounded as it is in technocratic expertise and
political accountability, is incompatible with judicial oversight. The
difference is that the New Deal view was rooted in hospitality toward
regulatory intervention and fear of politically motivated invalidation, by the
courts, of desirable administrative programs, whereas the modern
developments are based on hostility to intervention and fear ofjudicially
compelled regulation. But in either case, the doctrine of standing
serves to minimize the occasions for legal intervention into the
regulatory process, and thus to limit the strain between what are regarded as,
two distinct mechanisms for social ordering. Understood against this
background, the causation requirements are a means of ensuring
against the perceived excesses of Data Processingin allowing judicial
redress of what might be seen as essentially political grievances.' 53 That
rationalization, however, is ultimately unpersuasive.</p>
      <p>III. PUBLIC LAW AND STANDING</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>A. The Appropriate Role of Standing Limitations</title>
      <p>As a general rule, the question for purposes of standing is whether
Congress has created a cause of action.' 5 4 A congressional resolution
of the standing issue is almost always authoritative. It is in this sense,
152. Thus, in the 1930s, skepticism about the judiciary generally accompanied
enthusiasm about regulation; among conservatives, a minority in that period, skepticism
about regulation led to enthusiasm for the judiciary; and in the 1960s, liberal judges
combined hospitality toward regulation with enthusiasm for an aggressive judicial role.
See Sunstein, supra note 21, at 437-41. The general phenomenon is remarked on in
Note, Intent, Clear Statement, and the Common Law: Statutory Interpretation in the
Supreme Court, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 892, 910-12 (1982). See generally Sunstein, Statutes
and the Regulatory State (Sept. 1988) (unpublished manuscript on file at the Columbia
Law Review).</p>
      <p>153. One of the problems with the recent trend is that it treats a dispute as
"political," not because of the absence of legal constraints, but because the injury is different
from what is typical at common law. Whether a grievance is political depends on the
underlying statute; the question cannot be answered in the abstract. See infra notes
229-30 and accompanying text. Moreover, the political question doctrine-not
standing-is the appropriate tool for ensuring that courts do not hear cases involving issues
not suited to the judiciary. See Henkin, Is There a "Political Question" Doctrine?, 85
Yale LJ. 597 (1976) (suggesting political question applies where there are no legally
cognizable standards). Properly understood, the principles of standing deal with
appropriate plaintiffs, not with issues beyond judicial competence-though the two ideas have
not been kept entirely separate in practice. See, e.g., Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751
(1984) (suggesting that issues ofstanding must be considered in context ofseparation of
powers).</p>
      <p>154. There are some exceptions here. See infra notes 205-32 (discussing article III
and only this sense, that standing limitations are part of the "case or
controversy" requirement of article III; and it is in this sense that
standing doctrine serves an important separation-of-powers function.</p>
      <p>In many standing cases, however, the question whether Congress
has created a cause of action cannot be answered simply. The
legislature cannot be expected to resolve that question in every setting. The
APA is of course controlling in most administrative law cases, and
interpretation of the standing requirements of the APA is therefore the
central question. Probably the best approach here would have been to use
the legal-wrong test as it had been developing before Data Processing,
focusing attention on whether the plaintiff's interest was protected by
the underlying substantive statute. 155 The law has taken a quite
different direction, however, and it is possible to understand the current
injury-in-fact test as an interpretation of the APA that does relatively little
violence to the underlying purpose of that statute. The principal
function of the requirement of injury in fact-insofar as it provides a
limitation on standing-is to decrease the likelihood that outsiders or
intermeddlers t 56 will be able to disrupt mutually beneficial
arrangements. In this respect, the requirement of injury in fact-rooted in the
APA, not article III-promotes autonomy and self-determination on
the part of litigants. 15 7
and standing). In some cases, moreover, the issue is whether the Constitution itself
creates a right to bring suit. See infra note 208.</p>
      <p>155. See supra notes 39-51 and accompanying text.</p>
      <p>156. Here as elsewhere it is necessary to develop a standpoint from which to
describe some people as "intermeddlers" and others as "injured"; there is no extra-legal
way to make that determination, or to do so without invoking controversial substantive
considerations.</p>
      <p>157. Stewart, supra note I, at 1735-47. In Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727
(1972), the Court refused to recognize standing in an action brought by an
environmental organization whose members had not claimed use of a recreational preserve
threatened with an allegedly unlawful development project. Id. at 735. The Court's
conclusion was correct, for if none of those affected by the creation of a development in
the preserve was willing to come forward, a group of outsiders probably should not be
permitted to do so-at least as a matter of interpretation of the APA and other relevant
statutes. Cf. Brilmayer, The Jurisprudence of Article III: Perspectives on the "Case or
Controversy" Requirement, 93 Harv. L. Rev. 297, 310-15 (1979) (discussing autonomy
and self-determination as animating concerns of article III). A different result might be
appropriate if it could be shown that those directly affected were unwilling to bring suit
for reasons other than contentment with the status quo. See L. Tribe, supra note 15,
ยง 3-19.</p>
      <p>At least ordinarily, the fact that the law prohibits certain activity is not a sufficient
reason to permit a suit by outsiders. Agencies quite properly use prosecutorial
discretion to allocate resources among various problems; some of those problems may have
comparatively weak claims to the public fisc. If no one directly affected by government
action is sufficiently concerned to bring suit, the usual assumption-subject to
congressional override-ought to be that third parties should not be permitted to do so. Note,
however, that concepts like "bystander" and "outsider" are artifacts of preexisting ideas
about who should be able to bring suit and that all of the foregoing concerns are subject
to congressional revision. See infra notes 205-32 and accompanying text. Congress</p>
      <p>The causation requirements present different issues. Standing by
themselves, they are natural corollaries of the injury-in-fact
requirement and unobjectionable as such. But aside from their manipulability,
the central problem is that in the suits in question here, the relevant
harms are quite generally probabilistic or systemic. The purpose of the
regulatory program is to redress harms of precisely that sort.' 5 8 It
would be a large mistake to conclude that such harms are not judicially
cognizable. Nineteenth century conceptions of injury should not be
used to resolve standing issues in administrative law. Those
conceptions have no place in regimes in which the legal injury is often of a
different order. A system in which regulatory harms were not judicially
cognizable would tend to allow regulated industries, but not regulatory
beneficiaries, to have access to court-thus imposing a perverse set of
incentives on administrative actors by inclining them against regulatory
implementation when it is legally required. 5 9 Such a result would tend
to defeat congressional purposes. 160 Nothing in article III, the APA, or
the governing statutes justifies this result.</p>
      <p>In cases brought under the APA, then, courts should generally
allow standing to plaintiffs who seek to redress systemic or probabilistic
harms. On this view, there will remain a role for the causation
requirements,161 but the role will be the limited one suggested by the best of
the Supreme Court's decisions on the point.' 62</p>
      <sec id="sec-2-1">
        <title>B. Cognizable Injuries and the Appropriate Role of Causation</title>
        <p>It should come as no surprise that the causation requirements are
highly manipulable. Judgments about whether or not causation is
speculative depend on no clear metric. It is difficult to make systematic the
inquiry into whether government action against a third party is likely to
affect behavior in ways that will help a particular class of plaintiffs.
Thus, the Court has found that the causation requirements were met
when the connection between the injury, the defendant's conduct, and
could therefore reject the outcome in SierraClub by granting standing if it so chose; and
the best argument against the result in Sierra Club would be that the relevant statutes
should have been interpreted to create a cause of action for the plaintiffs.</p>
        <p>158. For the same argument in the context of constitutional claims, see Meltzer,
supra note 4, at 304 ("The common law understanding of injury, however, is not well
suited to deal with the distinctive problems of modern governments, which can cause
serious harm of a systemic or probabilistic kind that does not fit into the common-law
mold of identifiable injury to identifiable individuals.").</p>
        <p>159. See supra note 78 (listing regulatory initiatives brought about as a result of
suits by beneficiaries).</p>
        <p>160. For most of the nation's history, the question for purposes of standing and
article III was whether there was an invasion of a legal right. That question is analogous
to the inquiry recommended here. See Winter, supra note 8, at 1395-96.</p>
        <p>161. See infra notes 177-81 and accompanying text (discussing proper role of
causation as a limiting requirement).</p>
        <p>162. See cases cited infra note 163.
the relief sought were no clearer than in Linda R.S., EKWRO, and Allen
v. Wright.' 63 After these decisions, the precise nature of the causation
requirements is quite obscure. 164</p>
        <p>In particular, the causation requirements, as sometimes applied,
threaten to make standing issues turn on considerable discovery,
factfinding, and, worst of all, judicial speculation on the precise effects
of regulatory initiatives. All this is a significant disadvantage over the
pre-DataProcessingapproach, which depended on legal issues that could
be resolved on the basis of the pleadings without complex factual
inquiries. The new law of standing has in this respect come to be less
crisp and certain than the previous regime-precisely the opposite of
what the Data ProcessingCourt intended.</p>
        <p>A large amount of doctrinal confusion is the consequence. The
opinions of the en banc court of appeals in the Thomas case provide the
most conspicuous example. In that case, standing was made to turn on
an extraordinarily complicated inquiry into the real-world impact of
fuel economy credits on automobile manufacturers.16 5 There is
something seriously wrong with standing principles that produce so high a
degree of confusion in what is, after all, a jurisdictional determination.
Moreover, the relevant decisions have not turned on causation alone,
notwithstanding their rhetoric. The inquiry into causation is in part a
disguise for other sorts of considerations-prominently including the
view that Congress could not have intended to grant standing to
plaintiffs whose access to court would interfere with executive prerogatives
about implementation.' 6 6</p>
        <p>The manipulable nature of the inquiry into causation appears in a
less obvious and more important place as well. The central problem in
the causation cases is not whether there is a causal nexus among injury,
remedy, and illegality; it is how to characterize the relevant injury.
Whether the injury is due to the defendant's conduct, or likely to be
163. See Duke Power Co. v. North Carolina Envtl. Study Group, Inc., 438 U.S. 59
(1978). In Duke Powerthe plaintiffs complained that the Price-Anderson Act encouraged
the building of a nuclear power plant in their vicinity. Id. at 69. The Court concluded
that the various environmental and aesthetic consequences of thermal pollution were
sufficient to qualify as injuries "in fact." Id. at 73-74. But the claim of a causal
connection was quite speculative; it was hardly certain that such effects would occur, and their
consequences for any particular plaintiff were highly uncertain. Other cases allowing
standing despite relatively attenuated chains of causation include Heckler v. Mathews,
465 U.S. 728, 737-38 (1984); Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 239-42 (1982); Bryant v.
Yellen, 447 U.S. 352, 366-68 (1980); Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan
Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 261-64 (1977); and United States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S.
669, 687-90 (1973).</p>
        <p>164. Duke Powerusefully illustrates the point. See supra note 163; see also Chayes,
The Supreme Court, 1981 Term-Foreword: Public Law Litigation and the Burger
Court, 96 Harv. L. Rev. 4, 20-22 (1982); Fallon, supra note 5, at 37 n.201.</p>

        <p>166. See infra notes 189-93 and accompanying text.
remedied by a decree in his favor, depends on how the injury is
described. In EKWRO, for example, the plaintiffs might have
characterized their injury as an impairment of the opportunity to obtain medical
services under a regime undistorted by unlawful tax incentives. In Allen
v. Wright, the plaintiffs themselves argued that their injury should be
characterized as the deprivation of an opportunity to undergo
desegregation in school systems unaffected by unlawful tax deductions. 167
Thus recharacterized, the injuries are not speculative at all. 168 If
described at a certain level of generality, the causation requirements are
comfortably met in both cases. It is for this reason that in CenterforAuto
Safety v. Thomas, much of the dispute-under the rubric of
causationactually turned on whether the injury to the opportunity to purchase
fuel-efficient cars was a legally cognizable one.</p>
        <p>The device of recharacterization of the injury may seem artificial,
but it is at work in at least one Supreme Court decision. In Regents of the</p>
        <sec id="sec-2-1-1">
          <title>University of California v. Bakke,169 a question was raised about Allen</title>
          <p>Bakke's standing. There was no showing that Bakke would have been
admitted to the medical program of the University of California at
Davis if the affirmative action program were invalidated. The Court
responded that "even if Bakke had been unable to prove that he would
have been admitted in the absence of the special program, it would not
follow that he lacked standing.... The trial court found such an injury,
apart from failure to be admitted, in the University's decision not to
permit Bakke to compete for all 100 places in the class, simply because
of his race."1 7 0 The Court thus concluded that the interference with
the opportunity to compete was the relevant injury, and that the
causation requirements were met with respect to that injury.1 71 For
regulatory harms as well, the central question is whether an increased risk or
diminished opportunity is legally cognizable, or whether particular
plaintiffs must instead show that there is a substantial likelihood that
particular harm will come to them as individuals.</p>
          <p>The causation issues could, in short, turn entirely on whether
plaintiffs are permitted to characterize the relevant harm broadly rather
than narrowly. A relatively broad characterization has been critical not
only in Bakke, but in a number of lower court decisions as well.1 7 2 But

conclusion of nonmootness"), and Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 10 (1972) (finding no
legally cognizable injury as a result of data-gathering activities of Army), pose similar

characterized its injury as impairing "opportunity to compete"); Autolog Corp. v. Regan, 731
the Supreme Court has given little or no guidance for resolving the
problem of characterization.</p>
          <p>On one view, the problem should be solved by looking at the
nature of the interest protected by the relevant statutory or constitutional
provision. The harm might be characterized broadly if the relevant
source of law is designed to prohibit the injury thus characterized. A
related route would be to ask straightforwardly whether Congress
intended to confer on the plaintiff a right to bring suit. There are
significant advantages to such an approach, and to some degree it is endorsed
in current law. 17 3</p>
          <p>But the DataProcessingCourt interpreted the APA to confer a cause
of action on those harmed by agency behavior, thus separating the
issues of standing and the merits; 1 74 and this interpretation was intended
precisely to allow a brisk threshold determination, one that would not
call for elaborate statutory construction. On the other hand, it is
impossible in the hardest cases to decide standing issues without asking
whether the governing substantive statute is designed to protect the
plaintiffs; in those cases, some such inquiry is necessary because by
itself, the injury-in-fact test is too open-ended and malleable in an
integrated economy. Insofar as they act as crude surrogates for this
inquiry, the causation requirements confirm this proposition.</p>
          <p>A large part of the solution lies in a recognition that the problem
of standing is generally for legislative resolution, and that if Congress
chooses to create regulatory systems to prevent probabilistic or
systemic injuries, the usual rule ought to be that courts should permit
litigants suffering such injuries to bring suit. Nothing in article III or the
APA justifies a sharp split between injuries of the nineteenth-century
variety and injuries that regulatory systems are designed to prevent.
The question whether there is a "case or controversy" within the
meaning of article III depends largely or entirely on positive law, not on the
nature of the injury. 175 Moreover, a prohibition on standing in

tory cases would represent a partial return to the private-law model of
the 1950s and 1960s, allowing regulated entities, but not regulatory
beneficiaries, to bring suit. Such a result would skew regulatory
incentives against implementation, thus tending to defeat congressional
purposes and expectations.</p>
          <p>It follows that the Centerfor Auto Safety cases were quite easy.
Congress expressly conferred standing on the plaintiffs to redress
regulatory harms-"any person who may be adversely affected"-and there
was no need for elaborate speculation about the precise effects of
administrative controls. Even if the cases had not involved a specialized
standing provision and had arisen under the APA, the same result
would be appropriate. The regulatory harm provided the necessary
injury in fact, and with respect to that harm, there was no problem with
causation. It also follows that EKWRO and Allen were wrongly decided
as general standing cases, although EKWRO may have been correctly
decided because the area of taxation presents special reasons for
caution. 176</p>
          <p>To say this is hardly to suggest that courts should abandon the
causation requirements and the instincts that underlie them. Standing
should be denied in three categories of cases brought under the APA.
The first includes cases in which even broadly characterized injuries do
not meet the causation requirements. Suppose, for example, that the
plaintiffs are able to characterize their injuries in probabilistic or
systemic terms, but those injuries are not likely to be redressed by a ruling
against the defendant. 17 7 A denial of standing in such cases is a natural
implication of the injury-in-fact requirement that the Court has found
in the APA. If the harm, however characterized, is not likely to be
redressed by a ruling for the plaintiffs, it is appropriate to conclude that
there is no injury in fact. Judicial relief should be unavailable on the
same theory as in Sierra Club v. Morton,17 8 in which the plaintiffs did not
allege that they were actual or prospective users of the park in question.</p>
          <p>The second category includes cases in which the injury, once
176. See supra notes 105-06 and accompanying text.</p>
          <p>177. United States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 669 (1973), is an illustration here. Even as
recharacterized, the connection between the relief sought and the plaintiffs' injury was
extremely loose. For other possible examples, see Community for Creative
NonViolence v. Pierce, 814 F.2d 663, 666-70 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (denying standing to
homeless people seeking to challenge a report on the homeless); American Legal Found. v.
FCC, 808 F.2d 84, 89-92 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (denying standing to organization, which,
although having no members but only supporters, attempted to challenge FCC failure to
investigate network broadcasting concerning the CIA); California Ass'n of the Physically
Handicapped v. FCC, 778 F.2d 823, 825-27 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (denying standing to
association challenging transfer of ownership of television network stock on grounds that
stock transfer was unconnected with network's employment of physically handicapped
or network's failure to use methods of making broadcasts accessible to the hearing
impaired).</p>
          <p>178. 405 U.S. 727 (1972); see supra note 157.
recharacterized, is so generalized or diffuse that all or almost all citizens
are affected in the same way. 179 Recharacterized injuries may become
so open-ended that they are no longer properly treated as injuries at
all; here the proper analogy is to taxpayer or citizen standing. In such
circumstances as well, the case is quite similar to Sierra Club v. Morton,
and in the absence of a clear statement from Congress, standing should
be unavailable. The APA is properly interpreted to forbid standing in
such cases, even if the principle is understood as subject to legislative
override. This category is relatively small, however, as Bakke, Duke
Power, and the Centerfor Auto Safety cases reveal. It is critical not to use
the prohibition on citizen or taxpayer standing to support a broader,
and indefensible, view that disallows standing when a large number of
people are affected.</p>
          <p>Finally, and most importantly, standing should be denied to those
seeking to redress regulatory harms when there is good reason to
believe that Congress intended not to allow the suit to go forward. The
presumption here should be in favor of standing, since in DataProcessing
the Court interpreted the APA as creating a general background rule in
favor of standing for those harmed and arguably within the zone of
protected interests.18 0 Sometimes, however, that rule will be rebutted
by the statutory language or structure in particular cases, as the Court
found in Block v. Community Nutrition Institute.'8 ' By itself, the
injury-in179. The Court's decision in SCRAP may be incorrect because the case falls in this
category. SCRAP, 412 U.S. at 686-88. In Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54 (1986), the
Court properly denied standing to a doctor who attempted to defend a state statute
limiting abortion. The doctor claimed, in relevant part, that his injury consisted in a
smaller number ofchildren available for his medical practice. Id, at 66. But if injuries of
this sort sufficed, all or almost all citizens could defend restrictive abortiQn statutes,
Notably, however, the DiamondCourt recognized that the Illinois legislature might grant
standing even in such cases. Id. at 65 n.17; see also Clarke v. Securities Indus. Ass'n,
107 S. Ct. 750, 754 n.7 (1987) (recognizing that Congress may either grant or withhold
standing); EKWRO, 426 U.S. 26, 41 n.22 (1976) (legislature may grant standing, but
"'plaintiff still must allege a distinct and palpable injury to himself, even if it is an injury
shared by a large class of other possible litigants' ") (citations omitted).</p>
          <p>In CenterforAuto Safety v. Thomas, Judge Silberman attempted to assimilate the case
of consumer standing to the case of a harm applying to all citizens and all taxpayers.
847 F.2d 843, 886 (D.C. Cir.) (Silberman, J., concurring), vacated per curiam, No.
851515 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 16, 1988) (en banc). But the cases are distinct. The plaintiffs in
CenterforAuto Safety v. Thomas consisted of a subclass of the citizenry made up of people
who sought to purchase fuel-efficient cars; that subclass is sufficiently well-defined for
purposes of standing. Indeed, it is no different in principle from a class of employers
seeking to avoid regulatory controls.</p>

(1970).</p>
          <p>181. 467 U.S. 340, 346-48 (1984) (finding implicit preclusion of consumer
standing). The results in Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737 (1984), and especially EKWRO, 426
U.S. 26 (1976), might be defended on this ground, by reference to the peculiar nature of
standing in tax cases. See supra notes 105-07 and accompanying text; see also infra
notes 205-32 and accompanying text (discussing article III). On the background
assumption in favor of standing for those actually harmed, see Clarke, 107 S. Ct. at 755 n.9.
fact test is too open-ended to produce sensible results in an integrated
economy. Millions of people are affected "in fact" by many agency
decisions. In these circumstances, the application of the test in the
hardest cases will inevitably depend on a judicial perception of whether the
injury is direct or incidental, and that perception should be based on a
reading of congressional purposes. The causation requirements have
been made to do much of the work of restrictions on standing when
such restrictions are a plausible understanding of legislative will. That
issue should be approached more directly. If EKWRO was rightly
decided, it was because the tax statutes should have been interpreted so
as to deny standing, not because of a problem with causation; and if
people now thought to be indirectly or incidentally harmed by
regulatory action or inaction are to be denied standing, it is because the
denial is a sensible reading of congressional purposes in enacting
regulatory legislation.</p>
          <p>The usual solution, then, is that the intended beneficiaries of
regulatory programs should be permitted to bring suit to vindicate statutory
requirements. In some circumstances, suits will be brought by people
not within the zone of protected interests, or-as in Block and the tax
context of EKWRO-there will be some other indication that Congress
did not intend the suit to go forward. Most actions brought by
beneficiaries to redress regulatory harms will not, however, fall within these
categories, and the general rule of Data Processingwill control.</p>

      <sec id="sec-2-2">
        <title>C. Separationof Powers Revisited</title>
        <p>The recent standing decisions are rooted in part in views about
separation of powers. These views are quite distinct from notions of
causation, standing by themselves. Three central ideas support the
separation-of-powers concerns. The first is a belief that courts should
protect individual rights rather than general social interests; the second
invokes the "take Care" clause to argue against judicial interference
with executive implementation; the third emphasizes the availability of
the political process to protect interests in regulatory enforcement.
These ideas are interrelated. None of them, however, supplies a
sufficient reason for a refusal to treat probabilistic or systemic harms as
judicially cognizable, or indeed for a general reluctance to hear actions
brought by beneficiaries to bring about regulatory intervention.</p>
        <p>1. The Question of Individual Rights. - There is considerable
ambiguity in the view that courts should protect only traditional or
individual rights. In particular, it is not clear whether standing is to be
eliminated whenever many people are affected by the decision, or
instead when an interest in regulatory protection-an interest not
protected at common law-is at stake. If numbers are the crucial concern,
standing would be foreclosed not only for regulatory beneficiaries, but
also in cases in which many people or businesses are the object of
government control. Such cases provide the staple of administrative law;
consider, for example, a carcinogen regulation that affects numerous
industries and plants. No one would argue that, in cases of this sort,
affected industries should be deprived of access to judicial review to
test the question of legality. Such a result would mean quite generally
that the rulemaking activity of federal agencies could not be subject to
challenge from the objects of regulation. For this reason, the claim that
courts should protect only traditional or individual rights cannot be
made in terms of numbers alone.' 8 2</p>
        <p>It is quite plausible to suggest that citizen or taxpayer standing
ought to be unavailable, certainly in the absence of clear congressional
authorization.18 3 A rule of that sort can be supported by the basic
consideration that underlies the injury-in-fact requirement. People
ordinarily treated as bystanders ought not to be allowed to disrupt mutually
advantageous relations, 8 4 and in any case political remedies are most
reliable when all citizens are affected in the same way. This assumption
is part of the set of prudential limitations on standing' 8 5 -judge-made
clear statement principles that are subject to congressional override. l8 6
To say that citizen or taxpayer standing should be unavailable is not,
however, to say that when large numbers of people are affected by
agency action, they should be remitted to political remedies, whether
they are beneficiaries or objects of regulation. In both cases, the
plaintiffs are seeking to require administrators to comply with statutory
requirements; in both cases, the plaintiffs represent a subcategory of the
citizenry; and in both cases, judicial relief should be available to bring
about conformity to the law. i8 7 Nothing in article III argues against
182. On this score, the analysis in SCRAP is correct. See SCRAP, 412 U.S. at
686-88 ("To deny standing to persons who are in fact injured simply because many
others are also injured, would mean that the most injurious and widespread government
actions could be questioned by nobody. We cannot accept that conclusion.").
183. See supra note 105.</p>
        <p>184. See supra notes 156-57 and accompanying text. The term "bystander" is
subject to the usual qualification: the question whether someone is a bystander cannot be
decided prelegally, but is instead a function of the governing legal rules.</p>
        <p>185. Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church
and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 474-75 (1982) (listing prudential limitations).</p>
        <p>186. Clarke v. Securities Indus. Ass'n, 107 S. Ct. 750, 754 n.7 (1987) (prudential
limitations subject to congressional override).</p>
        <p>187. In Centerfor Auto Safety v. Thomas, Judge Silberman, concurring, suggests that a
class ofconsumers ought not to have standing to challenge regulatory action that makes
certain products available at'higher cost or not available at all-even if the relevant
action is unlawful, and even if Congress has expressly granted standing in such cases.
847 F.2d 843, 886 (D.C. Cir.) (Silberman, J., concurring), vacated per curiam No.
851515 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 16, 1988) (en banc). The underlying reasoning is obscure. The
rule against taxpayer or citizen standing is prudential in character, and the grant of
standing to classes of consumers is designed to vindicate statutory requirements against
administrative illegality. It is true that all citizens are in a sense consumers, id., but in
the relevant cases a subgroup of consumers seeking to purchase a particular product is
contending that the agency has violated statutory requirements. It is no more plausible
to deny standing because the relevant consumers are numerous than it is plausible to
this view, and the APA is best interpreted to grant standing in both
cases, even if the class of plaintiffs is quite large.</p>
        <p>An alternative view would not emphasize numbers, but would
instead distinguish sharply between the injuries of regulated entities and
those of regulatory beneficiaries. But this view, depending as it does on
nineteenth century conceptions of legal harm, cannot be sustained.'8 8
Congress has abandoned those conceptions, and in light of that
abandonment, the interests of beneficiaries are no more "general" or
"societal," and no less individual, than those of regulated entities.</p>
        <p>2. The "Take Care" Clause. - It is possible to supplement the
distinction between regulated entities and regulatory beneficiaries with a
reference to the "take Care" clause.' 8 9 On one view, the clause makes
it problematic for courts to compel executive implementation, rather
than to prevent agency action. In the former case, it might seem that
courts are usurping the President's power to "take Care" that the laws
are faithfully executed.</p>
        <p>The "take Care" clause, however, is a duty, not a license. 190 The
clause requires the President to carry out the law as enacted by
Congress. It does accord to the President-and no one else-the authority
to control the execution of the law when Congress has not spoken, and
that authority will involve a measure of discretion. But the President's
discretion, and the "take Care" clause in general, do not authorize the
executive branch to violate the law through insufficient action any more
than they authorize it to do so through overzealous enforcement.' 9 1</p>
        <p>If administrative action is legally inadequate or if the agency has
violated the law by failing to act at all, there is no usurpation of
executive prerogatives in ajudicial decision to that effect.' 92 Such a decision
is necessary in order to vindicate congressional directives, as part of the
judicial function "to say what the law is.' 9 3 The "take Care" clause
deny standing to the objects of carcinogen regulation because the relevant industry has
many members-or because the ultimate objects of regulation are consumers in that
setting as well.</p>
        <p>188. See supra notes 175-76 and accompanying text (arguing that the view
depends on an anachronistic conception of injury, is inconsistent with congressional
directives, and creates odd incentives for administrators); infra notes 205-32 (discussing
article III).</p>

Garland, Deregulation and Judicial Review, 98 Harv. L. Rev. 505, 562-63 (1985).
Those problems, however, do not bear on the issue of standing and should be taken care
of under a separate line of analysis. See Fallon, supra note 5, at 22-47, for a detailed
discussion.</p>
        <p>193. Marbury v.Madison, 5 U.S. (ICranch) 137, 177 (1803). It is for this reason
and concerns of separation of powers argue in favor of rather than
against a judicial role when statutory beneficiaries challenge agency
behavior as legally inadequate.</p>
        <p>3. PoliticalRedress. - It is not persuasive to respond that the legal
claims of statutory beneficiaries are properly handled in the political
process and not in the judiciary. To be sure, judicial review must be
seen as only a part of the network of controls on administrative action.
It is a large mistake to focus exclusively on the courts.1 9 4 In these
cases, however, the claim is that a regulatory agency has violated a
statute. Arguments that invoke the primacy of the democratic process call
for judicial involvement. The plaintiff is seeking to compel the
executive to comply with the political resolution as it is expressed in law. In
this sense, the problem of standing presents distinctive considerations
in the statutory realm. Nor is there a reason to distinguish between
these claims and the legal claims of regulated industries, which are of
course protected through the judiciary; a system that made the courts
available only to the latter would be hard to defend.</p>
        <p>In addition, the cases at issue involve legal, not political, claims-a
point often missed in the opinions.' 95 If the argument is genuinely
political in character, the plaintiff will lose on some ground other than
standing-either because there is no plausible claim on the merits, or
because the decision is committed to agency discretion by law.195 It is
true that cases of this sort will often involve a wide range of interests
and a number of affected parties. That fact should not, however,
obscure the point that the plaintiff's objection is that the agency has
violated a congressional directive; there are legally cognizable standards
by which to resolve that issue. 19 7 Far better devices than standing are
that the quotation from Allen v. Wright, see supra note 142 and accompanying text, is
largely a muddle. The question in that case was not whether courts should be "

violated the governing statute. See id. at 784 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>
        <p>194. See M. Reagan, Regulation: The Politics of Policy 113-17 (1987); D. Riley,
Controlling the Federal Bureaucracy 159-60 (1987); Sunstein, supra note 21, at 463-78.</p>
        <p>195. See Allen, 468 U.S. at 759-61; Center for Auto Safety v. Thomas, 847 F.2d

(D.C. Cir. Sept. 16, 1988) (en banc).</p>
        <p>196. Some plaihtiffs should, however, be precluded from bringing suit because of
the generalized character of their claims. See supra note 179 and accompanying text.</p>
        <p>197. In this respect, standing issues are quite different in the constitutional and
statutory realms. It is at least plausible to invoke such limitations as a prudential notion
designed to limit use of the Constitution to challenge legislative or executive behavior.
See A. Bickel, supra note 20, at 116-27 (judiciary's self-restraint in not granting
standing reduces clash between judiciary and other branches and preserves its power). Such
limitations received much of their impetus from efforts to insulate New Deal programs
from intervention from ajudiciary perceived to be hostile to regulation. See supra notes
20-25 and accompanying text. It is far less plausible to invoke prudential concerns as a
reason to shield administrative agencies from congressional limitations.</p>
        <p>The best argument in this connection would emphasize that governing legal
stanavailable for reducing inappropriate judicial intrusions in such cases,
including, most prominently, deference on the merits.</p>
        <p>The most general point is that there is no incompatibility between
a system of administrative regulation and a continued regime ofjudicial
control of administrative illegality. 198 Some of current law reflects an
emerging but still tentative belief-reminiscent of the New Deal-in
administrative autonomy from judicial intrusions, a belief that is
supported by similar references to agency expertise and accountability. 199
Here, however, the skepticism about judicial intrusion is typically
associated with fear that courts will compel rather than proscribe
administrative regulation 2 0 0-a peculiar reversal of the New Deal concern that
courts would invalidate, on ideological grounds, necessary
administrative action.</p>
        <p>From the standpoint of the separation of powers, this skepticism is
as myopic as its New Deal predecessor. There is no inconsistency
between adherence to law and administrative regulation, even if legal
intrusions occasionally produce pathologies. 20 Statutory requirements
will sometimes call for or proscribe agency action. Under the APA,
suits by those with a legal interest or an injury in fact as understood
here-including both beneficiaries and regulated entities, if
anachronistic concepts of this sort are to be used-should therefore be
permitted.</p>
        <p>It is, moreover, possible to read the recent cases relatively
narrowly. Both EKWRO and Allen involved efforts by one taxpayer to
litigate the tax liability of another. In neither case, moreover, were the
injuries characterized as regulatory harms. Bakke, 20 2 the Centerfor Auto
Safety cases, 20 3 and other decisions 20 4 suggest that under some
constidards are often ambiguous and suggest that in the absence of injury to an object of
regulation, outcomes should be the product of the political process, as reflected in
informal interactions involving the executive branch, legislative authorities, and affected
groups. This argument is, however, hard to defend when there is an injury in fact to a
regulatory beneficiary who is within the zone of protected interests. See supra notes
182-88 and accompanying text (criticizing distinction between objects and beneficiaries
of regulation).</p>
        <p>198. The nature ofjudicial intrusion must be made to accommodate the dynamics
of the regulatory process, and here there is considerable room for substantive
regulatory change and reform of the approaches of reviewing courts. See Mashaw &amp; Harfst,
supra note 132, at 312-16 (criticizing judicial review of rulemaking in NHTSA context);
Stewart, supra note 87, at 683-85 (suggesting market incentives replace legal regulation
in certain settings).</p>
        <p>199. See supra notes 20-25 and accompanying text.</p>
        <p>200. Thus, most of the standing cases involve suits brought by regulatory
beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>201. See Mashaw &amp; Harfst, supra note 132, at 302-09 (discussing pathologies of
legalism); Stewart, supra note 87, at 673-78 (same).</p>

tutional and statutory provisions, the device of recharacterization is
appropriate. There is thus reason to believe that the causation
requirements will not signal a significant departure from the
understandings that underlay the rejection of private-law notions of standing.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-3">
        <title>D. Injury, Causation,and Article III: An Excursus</title>
        <p>Because references to article III have played a prominent role in
recent standing decisions, it is useful to conclude with a brief treatment
of the relationship between the causation requirements, the
characterization of injuries, and the case or controversy requirement of article
111.205</p>
        <p>The connection between standing limitations and article III is far
from clear. Article III limits federal 'courts to cases or controversies,
but this limitation does not explicitly require that plaintiffs have a
particular stake in the outcome. A case or controversy might exist quite
apart from whether there is an injury, legal or otherwise, to the
complainant. To explore the problem, it is useful to distinguish among
three conceptions of the relationship between article III and standing
requirements. The first view would allow Congress to create judicially
cognizable injuries whenever it chooses; the second would interpret
article III to require a traditional private right; the third would impose
some limitations on congressional power to create judicially
enforceable rights, but would allow courts to redress regulatory harms of the
sort involved in the Centerfor Auto Safety and similar cases.</p>
        <p>On the first view, article III requires a case or controversy, but
whether there is a case or controversy is something on which, with
respect to standing, article III is silent. The existence of a case or
controversy with respect to standing is a question of positive law and
therefore for congressional resolution. Whether there is standing
depends on whether positive law has created it by granting a cause of
action or a legal right or immunity to the particular plaintiff. On this
view, article III does require standing in the form of a legally
cognizable injury; but article III does not say whether there is a legal injury in a
particular case. The existence of standing, like the existence of
property, depends on what the law provides. 20 6 Whether there is a "case or
205. See generally Berger, supra note 8, at 827 (questioning the historical accuracy
of the "personal stake" element of the article III "case or controversy" requirement in
Flast v. Cohen); Currie, Judicial Review Under Federal Pollution Laws, 62 Iowa L. Rev.
1221, 1225-47 (1980) (surveying requirements for judicial review under Glean Air Act
and Federal Water Pollution Control Act); Currie, supra note 103, at 183-85 (criticizing
Court as "unnecessarily stingy" in denying plaintiffs standing in EKWRO); Fallon, supra
note 5, at 47-59 (arguing in favor of broad congressional power to create legal rights
and therefore standing);Jaffe, supra note 8, at 1037-39 (arguing for a broader definition
of "case or controversy").</p>
        <p>206. In this respect, the problem of standing is distinct from the questions of
ripeness, mootness, and advisory opinions. The latter requirements are not wholly within
congressional control, though the legislative power to define injury includes some
controversy" is not answered by article III, but instead by Congress and
the Constitution in creating legal rights and obligations.</p>
        <p>On this view, moreover, the existence of standing and the
existence of a cause of action present the same basic question. And in this
respect, the requirement of standing serves an important
separation-ofpowers function, by ensuring that it will be Congress, rather than the
courts, that will decide who may bring suit against the government.
This view has two principal implications. The first is that litigants do
not have standing unless Congress or the Constitution has granted
them a right to bring suit. This view draws considerable support from
the first hundred and fifty years or so of the republic. 20 7 It also receives
significant though not unanimous support from the recent cases. 20 8
power over these requirements as well. What is distinctive about standing is that its
existence depends on the creation of a legal right. While there may be some limitations
on congressional power to create standing, those limitations, if they exist, are quite
insubstantial. See infra notes 221-32 and accompanying text. In all of these settings,
however, the New Deal reformation has large implications; but the general relationship
between justiciability and the rise of the administrative state is beyond the scope of the
present discussion.</p>

        <p>When the objects of regulation are seeking to test the question of authorization, it is
plausible to understand previous doctrine as having been rooted in a belief that the due
process clause implicitly furnishes a cause of action to bring suit. It was on this
understanding that courts permitted regulated entities to challenge unlawful administrative
incursions on their interests. This reading of the cases raises interesting questions
about more modern and more controversial cases in which plaintiffs claim that a
constitutional provision implicitly creates a cause of action. See, e.g., Bivens v. Six Unknown
Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 390-92 (1971). The
difference is that in some of the most controversial of the modern cases, damages are often
sought, and it may be less clear that plaintiffs are seeking to fend off unauthorized
governmental intervention; but that distinction is quite thin.</p>
        <p>On this view, moreover, some of the cases involving standing to assert
constitutional claims raise the question, not whether there is injury in fact, but whether the
relevant provision creates a cause of action. Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83 (1968), would
be understood as recognizing an implied cause of action under the establishment clause
when certain conditions are met. Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United
for Separation of Church and State, 454 U.S. 464 (1982), denied a cause of action when
those conditions were not met. Bivens, Flast, and Valley Forge thus raise closely related
questions. Furthermore, the struggle over the characterization of the plaintiff's injury in
cases involving constitutional claims might be understood as part of an effort to define
the circumstances in which constitutional provisions implicitly create causes of action.
In addition, the manipulable character of the causation requirements in constitutional
cases might be defended on the basis of the (controversial) claim, made most notably in
A. Bickel, supra note 20, at 115-27, that courts use doctrines of justiciability so as to
control the amount and timing of their intervention into the democratic process. The
discussion in the text, however, deals with the question whether and when the
ConstituThe second implication is that if Congress has granted such a right,
there is no problem under article III.</p>
        <p>Notably, the pre-Data Processingview of standing largely
incorporates this understanding of article 111.209 The legal-interest test reflects
a conception of standing that draws an inference of congressional
intent to allow the plaintiffs' action to go forward on the basis of the
congressional desire to protect their interests in the regulatory process.</p>
        <p>There is much to be said in favor of this view of article 111.210
Insofar as it suggests that the problem of standing is largely within
congressional control, it seems to be correct as a matter of both history and
logic. The basic position has, moreover, been accepted explicitly or
implicitly in a number of recent decisions by the Supreme Court.2 1 1
Those decisions recognize that the problem of standing is, in
administrative-law cases, governed by the APA, 21 2 and that Congress can create
standing if it chooses. 2 13 In this view, Congress can create a legal
injury where none had existed before. Consider the fact that the
Freedom of Information Act creates a cause of action for "any person, 2 14
and that the injury, thus defined, has raised no constitutional
problem. 21 5 Consider also the legislative creation of citizens' suits under
various statutes 216 and the creation of legal injuries quite foreign to the
common law. 2 17

        <p>For the most part, the question of standing therefore involves the
meaning of congressional enactments. 2 18 The Data Processing
requirement of "injury in fact" has confused this point. But it is notable that
the Supreme Court has also said that this requirement is a creation of
Congress in enacting the APA, emphasizing that the APA generally
creates standing for those whb are harmed, and that there need be no
separate indication of congressional intent to create a cause of
action.2 1 9 The downfall of the legal interest test in Data Processingis thus
an interpretation of the APA, 220 and the problem of standing in this
sense remains within congressional control.</p>
        <p>
          The claim that the problem of standing is for congressional
resolution might be thought to run into two sorts of constitutional objections.
First, the denial of standing, like the denial ofjudicial review, 22 1 might
sometimes raise serious problems under the due process clause or
article III. If, for example, Congress provided that those subject to
environmental regulation could not seek review of the regulation, a serious
problem would arise under the Constitution. In the modem period,
the same proposition may sometimes hold for regulatory
beneficiaries. 22 2 From this direction, one can find a limitation, even if a
relaof Fair Housing Act of 1968 "establishes an enforceable right to truthful information
concerning the availability of housing"); Trafficante, 409 U.S. at 212
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Civil Rights Act of
1968 creates right to protection against housing discrimination)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>218. See Clarke v. Securities Indus. Ass'n, 107 S. Ct. 750, 754 (1987) (describing
the problem in Data Processingas "basically one of interpreting congressional intent");
id. at 755 n.9, 757, 758 n.16 (emphasizing that availability of standing is different from
availability of implied cause of action because of broad purposes of standing provision
of APA).</p>
        <p>219. See id.</p>
        <p>220. But seeJ. Vining, supra note 1, at 39-41; supra notes 36-37 and
accompanying text.</p>
        <p>221. See supra note 34 and accompanying text.</p>
        <p>222. The denial of standing to regulatory beneficiaries would be most likely to run
into constitutional obstacles if the benefit is individual rather than collective. The issues
would be (a) whether the due process clause requires judicial review of the
administrative determination and (b) whether article III requires some role for a federal court in
supervising the administrative decision. See Fallon, supra note 32, at 963-67; cf.
Webster v. Doe, 108 S. Ct. 2047, 2051-52 (1988) (construing CIA statute so as to permit
judicial review of constitutional claims); id. at 2058-60 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (arguing
that there is no general right to judicial review); Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254,
260-61 (1970) (welfare benefits qualify as property for purposes ofprocedural due
process).</p>
        <p>If the answer to either question is in the affirmative, a legislative repeal of the
standing provisions of the APA, or a general effort to insulate administrators from judicial
review, would run into serious constitutional difficulty-unless heavy reliance is placed
on the distinction between legislative and adjudicative determinations. Compare
BiMetallic Inv. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 239 U.S. 441, 445 (1915) (taxpayer has no
due process right to a hearing when tax is part of general statute within state power)
with Londoner v. Denver, 210 U.S. 373, 385 (1908) (when state legislature commits the
tively unimportant one in practice, 223 on the claim that the question of
standing is for congressional resolution.</p>
        <p>The second constitutional objection is that the grant of standing
might sometimes be thought to raise questions under article III-an
objection that can be generalized into a second and different view of
the relationship between article III and standing requirements. On this
view, article III does impose substantive limitations on the sorts of
injuries that can be redressed in federal court. Only injuries to nineteenth
century individual rights-those that are, or that resemble,
commonlaw harms-can be remedied by the judiciary. Congress is without
power to allow federal courts to remedy certain sorts of injuries, even if
it attempts to create a cause of action to do precisely that. This view
takes various forms. 224 In all of those forms, however, the central point
is plain: article III allows federal courts to vindicate some injuries and
not others, and the line between them depends on traditional
conceptions of what constitutes a legal harm.</p>
        <p>Some of the Court's decisions offer support for this view,
appearing to conflate APA and constitutional standards, 22 5 to require a
judicially approved injury in fact no matter what Congress has said, and at
least to imply that the Constitution disallows standing even if Congress
has created it.226 For this reason, it is controversial to claim that there
are no limitations on congressional power to grant standing. To be
sure, any such limitations should come up infrequently even if they
exist. But on one view, the requirement of an injury in fact stems from
determination of the tax to a subordinate body, taxpayer has due process right to a
hearing).</p>
        <p>There would be no anomaly in a constitutional order that permitted Congress to
grant standing freely but limited its power to deny it. A principle of that sort is rooted in
the idea, with powerful roots in current law, that whether there is a legal "case" is a
function of positive law, but that there are constitutional limits on Congress's power to
authorize administrative officials to make unreviewable decisions about legal rights. But
a detailed exploration of these complex issues is beyond the scope of the present
discussion.</p>
        <p>223. The background rule recognized in the APA, allowing standing for regulated
entities and beneficiaries, means that the constitutional objection will come up quite
rarely, if at all.</p>
        <p>224. Thus it might be said that Congress is without power to authorize courts to
remedy probabilistic or systemic harms, or that courts may redress only injuries of the
sort cognizable at common law, or, more narrowly, that article III forbids Congress from
conferring on citizens a right to vindicate merely ideological claims. On the latter view,
Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727 (1972), is properly decided as a matter of article III,
but Congress has the constitutional power to overrule the decisions in, for example,
Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737 (1984), EKWRO, 426 U.S. 26 (1976), and Warth v. Seldin,
422 U.S. 490 (1975).</p>
        <p>225. Allen, 468 U.S. at 750-56; EKWRO, 426 U.S. at 38; United States v. SCRAP,
412 U.S. 669 (1973). But see Clarke v. Securities Indus. Ass'n, 107 S. Ct. 750 (1987).</p>
        <p>226. Allen, 468 U.S. at 750-52; EKWRO, 426 U.S. at 38-41. The cases are,
however, quite ambiguous on this point. See supra note 208.
article III; it forbids courts to redress or prevent regulatory harms; and
the requirement cannot be overcome by statute.</p>
        <p>That view is, however, misguided. 22 7 The best interpretation of
article III would recognize that Congress has the authority to define
legal rights and obligations, and that it may therefore, by statute, create
an injury in fact where, as far as the legal system was concerned, there
had been no injury before. Article III does not require an injury in fact,
even if the APA does, and article III certainly does not require a
traditional private right. Article III requires a case or controversy, a concept
that depends on the acts of Congress. Many of the Court's decisions
appear to recognize this point.2 28</p>
        <p>In this respect, the question whether an injury is merely ideological
or instead legal is one of positive law; there is no pre- or post-legal
metric for distinguishing between the two. This view draws support
from the original understanding of the case-or-controversy
requirement.2 29 It also draws support from the view, prominent in the
postNew Deal period as well as in the founding era, that whether there is a
case or controversy, or a legal injury and legal right, cannot be
understood independently of what the law provides. The modem network of
legal rights may or may not closely resemble the sorts of interests
protected at common law, and nothing in the Constitution requires that
they do so. There is much to be said, then, in favor of the view that
article III does not limit Congress' power to grant standing, and that
the only limitations, grounded in article III and the due process clause,
are those that prohibit Congress from denying standing in certain
cases. The contrary position is based on a peculiar and quite modem
revisionist reading of the Brandeis-Frankfurter effort-itself
revisionist-to immunize administrative regulation from judicial control. 23 0</p>
        <p>Like the second view, and unlike the first, the third approach reads
article III as imposing substantive limitations on the sorts of injuries
that plaintiffs may invoke; but it would allow courts to redress injuries
that do not in any sense resemble those recognized at common law. On
this view, Congress could not enact a statute providing, for example,
that all citizens may bring suit to redress all official illegality. The
requirement of an injury in fact is thus constitutional in status; it is not
solely an interpretation of the APA; and merely ideological or law
enforcement interests cannot be converted into legal harm by legislative
227. See supra notes 206-20 and accompanying text; see also Berger, supra note 8,
at 827; Fallon, supra note 5, at 30-34; Stewart, supra note 1, at 1735-42 (all resolving
the question in the same way as the text).</p>
        <p>228. See supra note 208.</p>
        <p>229. See Winter, supra note 8, at 1394-97; see also Berger, supra note 8, at 827,
832-35 (arguing against requirement of personal stake); Jaffe, supra note 8, at 1034
(same).</p>
        <p>230. See Winter, supra note 8, at 1442-52; supra notes 20-25 and accompanying
text.
fiat. 23 1 On the other hand, this third view would allow systemic or
probabilistic harms to be redressed if Congress has created a regulatory
system to reduce or eliminate those harms. If article III is to be
understood as imposing substantive limitations on the sorts of injuries that
may suffice for federal jurisdiction, this third position is preferable to
the second-even though, for reasons suggested above, the best view is
that article III permits Congress to create standing as it chooses.</p>
        <p>It would be ironic indeed if article III were interpreted to preclude
federal courts from compelling regulatory agencies to adhere to the
will of Congress by undertaking enforcement action to the degree or of
the nature that statutes require. Such an interpretation would be
reminiscent, above all, of the early period of administrative law, when
constitutional provisions were similarly interpreted so as to frustrate
regulatory initiatives in deference to private-law understandings of the
legal system.2 32</p>
        <p>CONCLUSION</p>
        <p>The rise of administrative regulation was a deliberate rejection of
common-law principles. In particular, regulatory regimes often
repudiated common-law baselines for distinguishing between inaction and
action, or neutrality and partisanship. In these circumstances, it is not
surprising that the principles governing legal control of administrative
behavior have largely abandoned common-law categories, allowing
courts to remedy violations of statutorily protected interests.</p>
        <p>Recent decisions by the Supreme Court and some lower courts,
however, threaten to reintroduce a sharp distinction between the
interests of regulatory beneficiaries and those ofregulated entities, a
distinction that would move the law not only toward the period before Data
Processing, but toward anachronistic understandings that restricted the
category of legally cognizable interests to nineteenth century private
rights. The recent use of the causation requirements has been justified
as an inference from the system of separation of powers, but it is more
realistically understood as an outgrowth of a private-law model of
public law, one that stems not from a belief in judicial restraint in the
abstract, but instead from hostility to suits brought by beneficiaries of
regulatory programs to ensure fidelity to statute. The reintroduction of
such hostility would not only be inconsistent with a wide range of cases
pointing in the direction of an independent public law; it would also
contradict the text and history of article III, fly in the face of
congressional understandings and expectations, and skew administrative
incentives in undesirable directions.</p>
        <p>231. The view that Congress should be entitled to define legal rights as it wishes is,
however, supported by judicial acceptance ofvarious provisions furnishing citizens' suits
against public and private actors. See supra note 77.</p>
        <p>232. See, e.g., Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905).</p>
        <p>Such a step should be firmly resisted. For the most part, the
question of standing is for legislative resolution. Because the constitutional
constraints are thin, the law of standing has generally depended on
congressional intent, which must sometimes be extrapolated on the
basis of background understandings about the circumstances in which
judicial relief ought to be presumed to be available.</p>
        <p>In the 1970s, the Supreme Court interpreted the APA as granting
standing to almost all those actually harmed by administrative
illegality2 3 3 -an interpretation that departed from the original understanding
of the APA, but that can be understood in a way that is largely
consistent with the basic purposes of that statute, and that placed the
problem of standing in the control of Congress, where it largely belongs.
Neither the APA nor article III need be interpreted to make
commonlaw conceptions of injury controlling in public-law cases. The
development of a set of independent, principles of public law is a large task
indeed; but in the context of itanding, a revival of private-law ideas,
coexisting with administrative regulation, would be singularly
illconceived.</p>
        <p>233. The qualification is necessary because (a) the "zone" test prevented suit by
those whose interests were entirely far afield of the statute and (b) the injury-in-fact test
had to be interpreted in such a way as to exclude suits by those incidentally or indirectly
harmed.</p>

          <article-title>An additional justification for standing limitations is that they are an effective means of limiting the federal caseload. But unless there is an independent reason for the limitation in question, it is an entirely arbitrary way of accomplishing that goal; and in any case, there is little evidence that the elimination of standing requirements would materially affect the number of suits brought in federal court. Indeed, the available evidence suggests that broadened standing has produced very little in the way of increased lawsuits-perhaps an unsurprising result in light of the numerous costs, monetary and nonmonetary, of initiating litigation</article-title>
