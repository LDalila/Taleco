Was the Standard of Care for

We determined the frequency of antenatal corticosteroid use
for mothers with threatened premature delivery in 1985,
1990, 1995, and 2000. We next compared published data to
the surveyed recollections of 302 obstetricians who were
practicing during these years. Two points emerged. First,
published reports reveal that the use of antenatal corticosteroids
increased steadily, from 8% in 1985 to 20% in 1990, 52% in
1995, and 75% in 2000 (P &lt; .001). Second, “expert” opinions
derived from the recollections of practicing obstetricians
consistently overestimated the actual use of antenatal
corticosteroids during the year in question—31% versus 8% for 1985,
56% versus 20% for 1990, 78% versus 52% for 1995, and 92%
versus 72% for 2000 (all Ps &lt; .001). The use of antenatal
corticosteroids by obstetricians in the past 15 years reveals a
phenomenon that is widely recognized
elsewhere—retrospective memories are often wrong, and when they are wrong
they are not randomly wrong. Rather, recollections are
systematically skewed toward an outcome that, in hindsight, is
considered desirable (the “Monday morning quarterback”
phenomenon). We offer a simple proposal. In determining
the “standard of medical care,” the legal system should rely on
statistical data about doctors’ performance rather than the
recollections of experts about doctors’ performance. The
fallible memories of isolated experts are a crude second-best, far
inferior to the data that they approximate. Widespread
adoption of this view by professional physician organizations
would dramatically increase the rationality of expert
testimony in medical malpractice tort law.

        Imagine this: In the early 1990s, a woman was admitted
to an obstetric service in the early stages of labor at 28
weeks’ gestation. At the time of admission, her fetus was
estimated to weigh 0.9 kg (2 lb). The likelihood of
survival for an infant born at that gestation in the early
1990s was approximately 80%. However, the likelihood
that the infant would exhibit respiratory distress
syndrome (RDS) of prematurity after birth was also
approximately 80%. There had been reports in the medical
literature for more than a decade that administration of
antenatal corticosteroids might reduce the incidence and
severity of RDS in infants after birth. However, the
indications and side effects of administering antenatal
corticosteroids to mothers were not well understood.
      </p>
      <p>Some obstetricians used antenatal corticosteroids
routinely in the early 1990s. Most did not. This woman’s
obstetrician did not.</p>
      <p>The woman delivered the infant at 28 weeks’
gestation, and it weighed 0.9 kg (2 lb). The infant was sick
with RDS but did not die. It suffered long-term
permanent morbidity related to the RDS. The obstetrician was
sued for malpractice—specifically, for failing to
administer antenatal corticosteroids to the mother before
delivery.</p>
      <p>At trial, the plaintiff’s expert claimed that in the early
1990s it was the “standard of care” to administer
antenatal corticosteroids, and that a failure to have
administered them to this mother constituted medical
negligence. This claim was based on the expert’s experience
and training in the field. A defense expert argued that
only a minority of obstetricians were using antenatal
corticosteroids in the early 1990s, and consequently the
standard of care, which he took to be the use of
“ordinary care in similar circumstances,” did not require
antenatal corticosteroids in this case. The defense expert
buttressed his opinion by pointing to a large body of
medical literature. Published articles described the
experience of more than 30,000 women in the early 1990s
who delivered comparably premature infants. The
overall percentage receiving antenatal corticosteroids was
20%.</p>
      <p>How should a juror decide which of these arguments
is more persuasive? More precisely, how much weight
should be given to statistical descriptions of medical
practice versus anecdotal recollection of an expert’s
individual experience?</p>
      <p>In most jurisdictions in the United States, jurors are
instructed that a doctor must “use the skill and care that
is ordinarily used by reasonably well-qualified doctors in
similar cases. . . . A failure to do so is a form of
negligence called malpractice.”1,2 Moreover, except in
unusually obvious circumstances (such as operating on the</p>
      <p>0029-7844/03/$30.00
doi:10.1016/S0029-7844(03)00510-6
wrong limb), lay jurors are not expected to understand
what level of care physicians ordinarily provide and
consequently are informed by the testimony of medical
expert witnesses. Expert witnesses, in turn, are expected
to describe the relevant standards of medical care by
reflecting on their own professional experience.2</p>
      <p>A problem immediately arises, although it is not
usually recognized as such. No additional instructions are
offered regarding the mechanism by which the expert is
supposed to convert experience, knowledge, and
training into an opinion. One might assume that the expert is
being asked to recall what he or she and his or her
reasonably well-qualified colleagues usually did in
similar circumstances and testify accordingly. This seems
obvious. However, there is much more to say. To begin
with, a great deal of literature over several decades in
many related areas of memory research suggests that
anecdotal recollection of past experience is flawed.3,4
Moreover, anecdotal recall is not randomly wrong—
rather, it tends to be skewed in the direction that in
hindsight would have been preferred. That is, once an
outcome is known to have occurred, the predominant
reaction is “I knew it all along.” This is often called the
“Monday morning quarterback” phenomenon.5,6</p>
      <p>Experts are not immune to such memory flaws. Even
professional golfers misremember. In an extensive
survey, golfers on average claimed that the percentage of
6-foot putts they made was 75%, but actual observation
put the number significantly lower, at 55%.7 As another
example, when emergency room physicians were asked
how long it took them to diagnose and begin antibiotic
treatment for children with suspected meningitis, they
recalled 46 minutes. Actual observation found the
number to be significantly longer, at 120 minutes.8</p>
      <p>These examples are not elicited to demonstrate that
professional golfers or emergency room physicians are
deliberately untruthful. Rather, selective skewed recall
appears to be part of us all. We would all rewrite parts of
history if we could, and in our minds, we cannot help
doing it.</p>
      <p>We have explored the Monday morning quarterback
phenomenon in the context of administration of
antenatal corticosteroids to women in preterm labor in the
United States over the past 15 years. To do so, we first
determined the actual use of antenatal corticosteroids at
5-year intervals between 1985 and 2000, as documented
in reports from tens of thousands of patients in the
medical literature. We then sampled the recollections of
several hundred potential “expert witnesses”:
obstetricians who had been in clinical practice during the period
in question. We compared the published data to the
recollections of the obstetric specialists.</p>

      <title>Published Data on Antenatal Corticosteroid Use From 1985 Through 2000</title>
      <p>
        To estimate the actual frequency of antenatal
corticosteroid use, we searched MEDLINE and PubMed for the
MeSH key word “antenatal corticosteroids.” We then
found and read each article that pertained to the
incidence of antenatal corticosteroid use in human infants in
1985, 1990, 1995, and 2000

        .9 –24 In addition, a National Institutes of
Health (NIH) conference on the use of antenatal
corticosteroids convened in 1994 produced many articles that
dealt directly and indirectly with antenatal corticosteroid
use and contained numerous references to earlier
studies. After 1994, several publications directly assessed the
impact of the NIH consensus statement on increasing the
use of antenatal corticosteroids. Finally, to assess recent
antenatal corticosteroid use
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56 ref58 ref59">(around the year 2000)</xref>
        we
could not rely on published literature, as much remains
in press or under review. Consequently, we reviewed
abstracts from pediatric academic societies and the
Society of Maternal/Fetal Medicine.
      </p>
      <p>We restricted our database to mothers for whom
antenatal corticosteroids might appropriately have been
prescribed. Consequently, we reviewed publications
with one of two possible inclusion criteria: 1)
prematurity or low birth weight—typically, very low birth weight
(VLBW) infants (birth weight less than 1500 g)—where
data were reported from population-based neonatal
intensive care unit outcome studies, or 2) RDS—typically,
mechanically ventilated infants—where data were
derived from studies of the efficacy of surfactant
administration.
“Expert Opinions” About Antenatal Corticosteroid Use
From 1985 Through 2000
We had no way of determining which obstetricians had
ever served as expert witnesses, nor were we interested
in sampling just that subset. Rather, we were interested
in demonstrating the phenomenon of hindsight bias for
the field as a whole. Consequently, we obtained a list of
all registered obstetricians in the United States from Ross
Laboratories. The obstetricians were identified by city
and state. We sent out two mailings of 500 surveys each
to ten randomly selected obstetricians in each of the 50
states. We received 153 responses from the first survey
and 149 responses from the second survey.</p>
      <p>The survey questionnaire described a hypothetic case
of a woman presenting in early labor at approximately
28 weeks’ gestation. The obstetricians were asked two
questions regarding the use of antenatal corticosteroids
for this woman:
1) What percentage of obstetricians do you think were
using antenatal corticosteroids in such cases in 1985,
1990, 1995, and 2000?
2) Was it your personal practice to administer antenatal
corticosteroids in such cases in 1985, 1990, 1995, and
2000?</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>Statistical Analyses</title>
      <p>Two separate mailings were sent to obstetricians
between July 2000 and June 2001. Responses regarding
antenatal corticosteroid use from the first mailing were
compared with those from the second mailing using both
two-way analysis of variance, with year as the
withingroup variable and mailing as the across-group variable,
and comparison of proportions test, with correction for
multiple comparisons. No significant differences were
found comparing results from the first and second
mailings. Consequently, data from the two mailings were
combined.</p>
      <p>Responses from the obstetricians regarding antenatal
corticosteroids were then contrasted with data derived
from the medical literature using two-way analysis of
variance, z scores derived from the comparison of
proportions test, and 2 analysis.25 Meta-analysis of the
multiple published descriptions of antenatal
corticosteroid use during each period was performed using the
number of patients involved, not the number of hospitals
or publications. For all tests, an level of P .01 was
required to assume statistical significance.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>RESULTS</title>
      <p>Table 1 shows antenatal corticosteroid use in 1985,
1990, 1995, and 2000, as determined from case reports of
92,169 infants in the medical literature. Figure 1
contrasts the use of antenatal corticosteroids as reported in
the medical literature with the compiled recollections of
302 “expert” obstetrician respondents to our
questionnaire. Two points are readily apparent. First, published
reports revealed that the use of antenatal corticosteroids
increased steadily, from 8% in 1985 to 20% in 1990, 52%
in 1995, and 75% in 2000 (P .001). Second, expert
opinions derived from the recollections of practicing
obstetricians consistently overestimated the actual use of
antenatal corticosteroids during every year in question:
31% versus 8% for 1985, 56% versus 20% for 1990, 78%
versus 52% for 1995, and 92% versus 72% for 2000 (all
Ps .001).</p>
      <p>
        In addition to consistently overestimating their
colleagues’ use of antenatal corticosteroids from 1985 to
2000, the obstetrician respondents consistently ranked
their personal use higher than their estimates of the
average behavior at the time: 68% versus 3
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">1% in 1985</xref>
        ,
88% versus 56% in 1990, 99% versus 78% in 1995, and
100% versus 92% in 2000 (all Ps .01).
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>We demonstrate a phenomenon that is widely
recognized elsewhere: Retrospective memories are often
wrong, and when they are wrong they are not randomly
wrong. Rather, recollections are systematically skewed
toward an outcome that, in hindsight, is considered
desirable.</p>
      <p>Over the past 15 years it has become widely accepted
that antenatal corticosteroid administration to women in
preterm labor significantly reduces complications in
prematurely delivered infants.9 –12 Antenatal corticosteroid
use has risen roughly ten-fold, from 8% to 75% for
prematurely delivered infants during this period.
Consequently, viewed retrospectively from the vantage point
of 2001, antenatal corticosteroid use for women in
preterm labor at 28 weeks’ gestation has always been
desirable. As we hypothesized, the recollections of 302
obstetricians surveyed in 2001 about the use of antenatal
corticosteroids for preterm labor in the past 15 years
were wrong and predictably skewed. Obstetricians
recalled antenatal corticosteroid use to have been greater
than it demonstrably was at each 5-year interval between
1985 and 2000.</p>
      <p>To the extent that obstetricians like the ones in our
survey might serve as expert witnesses in antenatal
corticosteroid cases, testifying about ordinary care in similar
circumstances based upon their recollection of their own
personal experience, they are likely to be wrong. What
do such discrepancies between recollections of expert
practitioners and objective documentation of medical
practice imply for expert testimony in cases of alleged
medical negligence?</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>Personal Knowledge and Statistical Knowledge</title>
      <p>A substantial body of evidence on the psychology of
decision making documents systematic biases in the anecdotal
recall of experience. People are excessively optimistic about
what can happen or has happened; at the same time, they
are overconfident about the accuracy of their
memories.26–28 Medical experts are not immune from this
phenomenon.3,8,29–31 Moreover, and perhaps most
importantly from the standpoint of malpractice testimony, people
reliably suffer from hindsight bias. Once an outcome is
known to have occurred, the predominant reaction is “I
knew it all along.”3,5,29–31 Excessive optimism and skewed
recall about past practices appear to be human nature. This
point raises some serious problems for adjudication of
negligence allegations.</p>
      <p>A central purpose of medical malpractice law is to protect
the general public by ensuring that physicians provide
reasonable care. Reasonable care is determined, at least in
part, by asking about ordinary practice. If descriptions of
ordinary practice are important to the judicial process, why
should jurors and judges rely on the fallible and
anecdotedriven recollection of an individual expert’s experience,
especially if we know that this recollection is likely to be
wrong? Instead, why not inform jurors and judges of the
verified and reverifiable collective experience of dozens,
hundreds, or even thousands of cases reported by
comparably expert physicians? Citations of practice distributions
derived from published medical literature could provide a
necessary buffer for jurors specifically and the public more
generally against the inevitable possibility that an individual
expert’s memory is faulty.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-8">
      <title>Methodological Concerns With Reliance on Databases</title>
      <p>Several methodological concerns must be addressed
directly. Most reflect difficulties traditionally associated
with meta-analysis of the efficacy of medical procedures.
Comparisons across and within studies of different size
may be difficult to describe succinctly. How is one to
balance a small study from a single center with a large
study from multiple centers? As an example from the
antenatal corticosteroid analysis, in 1990 14% of 11,077
infants reported from 446 centers in the Exosurf
Neonatal Treatment Investigational New Drug Program
received antenatal corticosteroids,12 compared with 20%
of 480 infants reported from a single center by Teberg et
al.13 Should we consider the number of studies or the
number of patients within studies? Further, single
publications that report data from multiple centers often
describe a wide spectrum of behavior around a mean value.
As an example, the use of antenatal corticosteroids
among the 30 reporting centers of the Vermont-Oxford
Trials Network in 1990 ranged from 0% to 58%.18
Finally, inclusion criteria may differ across studies.
Consider in the context of antenatal corticosteroids whether
a hypothetic published article included or excluded
mothers with premature rupture of membranes,
pregnancies above 32 gestational weeks, pregnancies below
26 gestational weeks, or twins. Each of these conditions
has, at times, been argued to be a contraindication for
administration of antenatal corticosteroids.9 –11</p>
      <p>There are two related questions here, one narrow and
one broad. Narrowly, how can we deal with published
data in the context of the standard of care for antenatal
corticosteroids? More generally, given the recognition
that published studies will always have overlapping but
nonidentical inclusion criteria and that they will
inevitably invoke an interval of uncertainty around every point
estimate, how can statistical analysis ever determine the
standard of care for a single case?</p>
      <p>In the specific instance of antenatal corticosteroids,
one might proceed as follows: Our survey was
deliberately designed to ask obstetricians about behavior in a
single “idealized” case, analogous to the opinion an
expert witness would be asked to provide in a single case
of alleged negligence. Published data are, inevitably,
more messy. Even when antenatal corticosteroid use is
intended in all cases, we must assume there will be some
“slippage,” such as mothers who for one reason or
another did not receive antenatal corticosteroids even
though the doctors intended them to do so.
Consequently, the actual use of antenatal corticosteroids will
always be a bit lower than the intended use. How can we
account for this slippage in our data-based formulation of
standard medical care?</p>
      <p>We might start by assuming that by the year 2000
almost all obstetricians wanted to use antenatal
corticosteroids in idealized cases of women threatening preterm
delivery. We then can look to see how close the
obstetricians came to that ideal and note that the answer is
“quite close.” In 2000, approximately 75% of 30,000
mothers who delivered VLBW infants received
antenatal corticosteroids (cf Figure 1 and Table 1). This, then,
can be taken as a “ceiling” against which other
comparisons can be measured. As an example, in 1990, 20% of
all VLBW infants actually received antenatal
corticosteroids, compared with a theoretic ceiling of 75% who
might have received antenatal corticosteroids.
Consequently, the “adjusted” antenatal corticosteroid use in
idealized circumstances in 1990 was approximately 20 of
75 (27%). Even after adjustment for slippage, this value is
significantly lower than the 56% that our obstetricians
recalled for antenatal corticosteroid use in 1990. For
every time interval studied, even after adjusting
published reports of antenatal corticosteroid use to account
for the potential of nonideal cases, “expert recollection”
still significantly overestimated adjusted antenatal
corticosteroid use.</p>
      <p>There is a larger claim here. Meta-analysis has become
widely accepted in modern medicine. Indeed, it has
become essential to the growth of evidence-based
medical care in obstetrics and elsewhere. However,
metaanalysis is complicated. One possible response to these
complexities might be to argue that statistical analysis is
just too hard for judges, lawyers, and juries to
understand. If this is true, then attempts to import data into the
courtroom are doomed. In such a postmodern legal
world, the scientific method would be abandoned and
only anecdotal narrative would survive.</p>
      <p>There is another response, which we favor. We
welcome methodological complexities and encourage their
elucidation enthusiastically. With this view, the more
light shone upon the meaning of data and the difficulties
of importing it the better, precisely because accuracy is
what is most important. Whatever difficulties might arise
in importing statistical methodology into the courtroom,
these problems pale against the alternative: relying on
the memories of individual experts, where none of the
methodological rigor required for scientific analysis is
applied, or even acknowledged, and where the
recollections are almost certain to be inaccurate.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-9">
      <title>Ordinary Practice and the Standard of Medical Care</title>
      <p>Is standard medical care always the standard of medical
care? That is, are physicians obliged to administer the
care that is “ordinarily provided in the same or similar
circumstances,”1 or are physicians obliged to conform to
a more aspirational standard, “the care that should be
provided in such circumstances”? In other words, does
customary practice determine negligence?</p>
      <p>There is a dispute about the weight to be given to
ordinary practice in medical negligence cases. In some
jurisdictions, custom defines reasonable conduct.32– 40
However, in other jurisdictions, both federal41 and
state,42– 45 a more aspirational standard is applied (not
what physicians ordinarily do, but what a reasonable
physician should have done), and customary medical
treatment is not decisive on the exercise of standard care.</p>
      <p>In these latter jurisdictions, do statistical compilations of
normative practice become irrelevant to expert
testimony regarding the standard of care?</p>
      <p>The answer is “No.” Even when ordinary practice is
not controlling, it is always relevant, and when it is
relevant, juries and judges should learn what it actually
is. Moreover, in their attempts to influence judge and
jury, experts ought to distinguish exhortation from
normative description. As an example, consider expert
testimony in the context of an allegation concerning
whether use of antenatal corticosteroids for a woman in
preterm labor in the early 1990s was part of the ordinary
standard of care. One can envision an expert obstetric
witness saying that one should have given antenatal
corticosteroids to this woman or even that he or she would
have given antenatal corticosteroids (although,
intriguingly, our data suggest that even these memories are
flawed). However, under no circumstances could an
expert accurately claim that administration of antenatal
corticosteroids in the early 1990s conformed to ordinary
care in similar circumstances. That point is sufficient for
our purposes here. If legal authorities want to depart
from the standard of ordinary care, they should do so
with an accurate rather than fanciful understanding of
what ordinary care is (cf Meadow46,47).</p>
      <p>There can be no doubt that experts know a great deal
about topics on which ordinary people lack information.</p>
      <p>But experts, no less than other people, are subject to
predictable memory biases. As a specific example, we
have shown that a majority of obstetricians “recalled”
antenatal corticosteroid use to be common in the early
1990s, but the best available data suggest that only a
small minority of obstetricians were actually using
antenatal corticosteroids during this time.</p>
      <p>We offer a simple proposal. In determining the
standard of medical care, the legal system should rely,
whenever it can and far more than it now does, on statistical
data about doctors’ performance rather than the
opinions of experts about doctors’ performance. The fallible
memories of isolated experts would be seen as a kind of
crude second-best, far inferior to the data that they
approximate. Widespread adoption of this view by
professional physician organizations, supplemented by
anticipatory publication of practice distributions for
potentially problematic clinical scenarios, would dramatically
increase the sense and rationality of expert testimony in
medical malpractice tort law.
