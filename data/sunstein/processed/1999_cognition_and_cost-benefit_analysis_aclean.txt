Sunstein* “The American people have no doubt that more people die from coal dust than from nuclear reactions, but they fear the prospect of a nuclear reactor more than they do the empirical data that would suggest that more people die from coal dust, having coal-fired burners. They also know that more lives would be saved if we took that 25 percent we spend in the intensive care units in the last few months of the elderly’s lives, more children would be saved. But part of our culture is that we have concluded as a culture that we are going to rightly, or wrongly, we are going to spend the money, costing more lives, on the elderly. . . . I think it’s incredibly presumptuous and elitist for political scientists to conclude that the American people’s cultural values in fact are not ones that lend themselves to a cost-benefit analysis and presume that they would change their cultural values if in fact they were aware of the cost-benefit analysis.”1           Joseph Biden Many people have argued for cost-benefit analysis on economic grounds.2 On their view, a primary goal of regulation is to promote economic efficiency, and cost-benefit analysis is admirably well-suited to that goal. Arguments of this kind have met with sharp criticism from those who reject the efficiency criterion3 or who believe that in practice, cost-benefit analysis is likely to produce a kind of regulatory paralysis.4 In this essay I offer support for cost-benefit analysis, not from the standpoint of conventional economics, but on grounds associated with cognitive psychology and behavioral economics. My basic suggestion is that cost-benefit analysis is best defended as a means of overcoming predictable problems in individual and social cognition. Most of these problems might be collected under the general heading of selective attention. Cost-benefit analysis should be understood as a method for putting “on screen” important social facts that might otherwise escape private and public attention. Thus understood, cost-benefit analysis is a * Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Jurisprudence, University of Chicago Law School.

Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis words, I try to show how a certain understanding of cost-benefit analysis might contain considerable appeal precisely because it overcomes problems in individual cognition, and do so without taking a stand on controversial issues about the ultimate goals of regulation and law. Let us begin with two simple tables. It is well known that there is a great deal of variability in national expenditures per life saved. Consider the following, which has come to define many discussions of these problems7: Table 1: Cost Per Life Saved Cost-Effectiveness of Selected Regulations Regulation Unvented Space Heater Ban Aircraft Cabin Fire Protection Standard Auto Passive Restraint/Seat Belt Standards Steering Column Protection Standard Underground Construction Standards Trihalomethane Drinking Water Standards Aircraft Seat Cushion Flammability Standard Alcohol and Drug Control Standards Auto Fuel-System Integrity Standard Standards for Servicing Auto Wheel Rims Aircraft Floor Emergency Lighting Standard Concrete & Masonry Construction Standards Crane Suspended Personnel Platform Standard Passive Restraints for Trucks & Buses (Proposed) Side-Impact Standards for Autos (Dynamic) Children’s Sleepwear Flammability Ban Auto Side Door Support Standards Low Altitude Windshear Equipment & Training Standards Electrical Equipment Standards (Metal Mines) Trenching and Excavation Standards Agency Cost-Effectiveness of Selected Regulations Regulation Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance (TCAS) Systems Hazard Communication Standard Cost per premature death averted ($ millions 1990) Agency Grain Dust Explosion Prevention Standards Rear Lap/Shoulder Belts for Autos Standards for Radionuclides in Uranium Mines Ethylene Dibromide Drinking Water Standard Asbestos Occupational Exposure Limit Benzene Occupational Exposure Limit Electrical Equipment Standards (Coal Mines) Arsenic Emission Standards for Glass Plants Ethylene Oxide Occupational Exposure Limit Hazardous Waste Listing for Petroleum Refining Sludge Cover/Move Uranium Mill Tailings (Inactive Sites) Cover/Move Uranium Mill Tailings (Active Sites) Acrylonitrile Occupational Exposure Limit Coke Ovens Occupational Exposure Limit Lockout/Tagout Asbestos Occupational Exposure Limit Arsenic Occupational Exposure Limit Asbestos Ban Diethylstilbestrol (DES) Cattlefeed Ban 1,2 Dichloropropane Drinking Water Standard Hazardous Waste Land Disposal Ban (1st 3rd) Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Standards (Proposed) Formaldehyde Occupational Exposure Limit Atrazine/Alachlor Drinking Water Standard Hazardous Waste Listing for Wood-Preserving Chemicals Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis This table should be taken with many grains of salt.8 It does not contain nearly all of the benefits from regulation, including those that fall short of mortalities averted (including illnesses averted, benefits for animals, and aesthetic and recreational gains). An adequate cost-benefit analysis would certainly take those benefits into account. We will shortly see that the table depends on many contentious assumptions, above all involving the appropriate discount rate; modest changes in the discount rate can greatly reduce the expenditures and the disparities. But at the very least, the table creates a presumption that the current system of regulation suffers from serious misallocation of resources. It also suggests that with better allocations, we could obtain large gains. Indeed, a recent study finds that it would be possible to save the same number of lives that we now save with tens of billions of dollars left over—and that better priority-setting could save 60,000 lives, and 636,000 lifeyears, annually at the same price.9 What is the source of the misallocations? Interest-group power undoubtedly plays a substantial role, as well-organized groups are able to obtain measures in their interest or to fend off measures that would harm them, and as poorly organized ones typically fail. Indeed, cost-benefit analysis might be defended partly as a corrective to interest-group power, operating as it might as a kind of technocratic check on measures that would do little good or even produce net harm (and also on measures that do much less good than they should).10 But officials are of course responsive not only to interest groups but also to general public pressures, and thus part of the answer must lie in the distinctive judgments of ordinary people, who do not assess risks through a well-informed cost-benefit lens. Indeed, divergences between expert and lay assessments of risks have been demonstrated in many places. Consider this comparison.11 Table 2: Rating health risks Public 1. Hazardous waste sites 2.

Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis I. Six Problems in the Public Demand for Regulation For the moment, I attempt no controversial specification of cost-benefit analysis and understand the term broadly to refer to a regulatory method that calls for regulators to identify, and make relevant for purposes of decision, the good effects and the bad effects of regulation, and to quantify those as much as possible in terms of both dollar equivalents and life-years saved, hospital admissions prevented, workdays gained, and so forth. Let us also assume that cost-benefit analysis, thus understood, can accommodate distributional factors, by, for example, giving distributional weights to certain adverse effects, or by assuming uniform numbers for various goods (such as increased longevity) so as to ensure that they do not vary in accordance with wealth. The first problem is purely cognitive: the use of the availability heuristic in thinking about risks.15 It is well-established that people tend to think that events are more probable if they can recall an incident of its occurrence.16 Consider, for example, the fact that people typically think that more words, on any given page, will end with the letters “ing,” than have “n” as the second-to-last letter (though a moment’s reflection shows that this is not possible).17 With respect to risks, 13 A colorful discussion is Barry Glassner, The Culture of Fear: Why Americans are Afraid of the Wrong Things (1999). judgments are typically affected by the availability heuristic, so that people overestimate the number of deaths from highly publicized events (motor vehicle accidents, tornadoes, floods, botulism), but underestimate the number from less publicized sources (stroke, heart disease, stomach cancer).18 Similarly, much of the concern with nuclear power undoubtedly stems from its association with memorable events, including Hiroshima, Chernobyl, and Three-Mile Island. The availability heuristic does not, of course, operate in a social vacuum. It interacts with emphatically social processes, and in particular with informational and reputational forces.20 When one person says, through words or deeds, that something is or is not dangerous, he creates an informational externality.21 A signal by some person A will provide relevant data to others. When there is little private information, such a signal may initiate an informational cascade, with significant consequences for private and public behavior, and with possibly distorting effects on regulatory policy.22 Imagine, for example, that A says that abandoned hazardous waste sites are dangerous, or that A initiates protest activity because such a site is located nearby. B, otherwise skeptical or in equipoise, may go along with A; C, otherwise an agnostic, may be convinced that if A and B share the relevant belief, the belief Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis must be true; and it will take a confident D to resist the shared judgments of A, B, and C. The result of this set of influences can be social cascades, as hundreds, thousands, or millions of people come to accept a certain belief simply because of what they think other people believe.23 There is nothing fanciful to the idea. Cascade effects help account for the existence of widespread public concern about abandoned hazardous waste dumps (a relatively trivial environmental hazard), and in more recent years, they spurred grossly excessive public fears of the pesticide Alar, of risks from plane crashes, and of dangers of shootings in schools in the aftermath of the murders in Littleton, Colorado. Such effects recently helped produce massive dislocations in beef production in Europe in connection with “mad cow disease”; they are currently giving rise to growing European fear of genetic engineering of food. 23 See David Hirshleifer, The Blind Leading the Blind: Social Influence, Fads, and Informational Cascades, in The New Economics of Human Behavior 188 (Mariano Tommasi & Kathyrn Ierulli eds., 1995). nothing undemocratic about a governmental effort to divert resources to serious problems that have not been beneficiaries of cascade effects. Why are people so concerned about the risks of nuclear power, when experts tend to believe that the risks are quite low—lower, in fact, than the risks from competing energy sources, such as coal-fired power plants, which produce relatively little public objection? Why do they believe that small risks from pesticides should be regulated, even if comparatively small risks from X-rays are quite tolerable? Suggestive answers come from research suggesting that for many activities that pose small risks but that nonetheless receive public concern, people perceive low benefits as well as high risks.25 For example, nuclear power itself is seen as a low-benefit, high-risk activity. Similar findings appear for some activities that are in fact relatively high-risk: a judgment of “low risk” accompanies a judgment of “high benefits.” The very fact that they are known to have high benefits skews judgment in their favor, and hence makes people understate the costs as well. 25 The fact that nuclear power, and application of pesticides, produce benefits as well as risks may not “register” on the lay viewscreen, and this may help produce a “high risk” judgment. See Ali Siddiq Alhakami and Paul Slovic, A Psychological Study of the Inverse Relationship Between Perceived Risk and Perceived Benefit, 14 Risk Analysis 1085, 1088 (1994). Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis a new risk adds danger, people may focus on the danger itself, and not on the benefits that accompany the danger. And an important problem here is that in many cases where dangers are on-screen and benefits off-screen, the magnitude of the danger is actually quite low. Cost-benefit analysis can be a corrective here, by placing the various effects on-screen. Often people focus on small pieces of complex problems, and causal changes are hard to trace. Consider an analogy. The German psychologist Dietrich Dorner has done some illuminating computer experiments designed to see whether people can engage in successful social engineering.29 Participants are asked to solve problems faced by the inhabitants of some region of the world. Through the magic of the computer, many policy initiatives are available to solve the relevant problems (improved care of cattle, childhood immunization, drilling more wells). But most of the participants produce eventual calamities, because they do not see the complex, system-wide effects of particular interventions. Only the rare participant can see a number of steps down the road—to understand the multiple effects of one-shot interventions on the system. of Measure to Value Environmental Changes, in Environment, Ethics, and Behavior: The Psychology of Environmental Valuation and Degradation 52, 64-65 (Max H. Bazerman, David M. Messick, Ann E. Tenbrunsel & Kimberly A. Wade-Benzoni eds., 1997). Chicago Working Paper in Law and Economics increase electricity prices, and because higher electricity prices will deprive poor people of air conditioning or lead them to use it less, such regulation may literally kill people.32 These are simply a few examples of situations in which a government agency is inevitably making “health-health tradeoffs” in light of the systemic effects of one-shot interventions. Indeed, any regulation that imposes high costs will, by virtue of that fact, produce some risks to life and health, since “richer is safer.”33 A virtue of cost-benefit analysis is that it tends to overcome people’s tendency to focus on parts of problems, by requiring them to look globally at the consequences of apparently isolated actions. A set of data now suggests that people are subject to “alarmist bias.”34 The mere existence of discussions of new risks can aggravate concern, even when the discussions take the form of assurances that the risk level is relatively low. And when presented with information suggesting that a risk may range from A (low) to Z (high), the high risk number is especially salient, and it appears to have a disproportionate effect on behavior. phenomenon, see John D. Graham and Jonathan Baert Wiener, Risk Versus Risk (1995). Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis price of flying and causing a shift to driving, a more dangerous form of transportation).37 It is important to be careful with the relevant categories here. There is no sharp distinction between “cognition” and “emotion.”38 Emotions are generally the products of beliefs, and hence an emotional reaction to risk—terror, for example—is generally mediated by judgments.39 But this is not always true; sometimes the operation of the brain allows intense emotional reactions with minimal cognitive activity.40 In any case the judgments that fuel emotions may be unreliable. We need not venture into controversial territory in order to urge not that emotions are free of cognition, but that some risks seem to produce extremely sharp, largely visceral reactions. These reactions are sometimes largely impervious to argument. Indeed, experience with “mass panics” has shown exactly this structure, as assurances based on statistical evidence have little effect in the face of vivid images of what might go wrong.41 Some fears even appear to have a genetic foundation; consider, as a possible example, fear of snakes, which appears in people who have no reason to think that snakes are dangerous. F. Separate Evaluation and Incoherence Suppose that you are asked to say, without reference to any other problem, how much you would be willing to pay to protect certain threats to coral reefs. Now suppose that you are asked to say, without reference to any other problem. how much you would pay to protect against skin cancer among the elderly. Suppose, finally, that you are asked to say how much you would be willing to pay to protect certain threats to coral reefs and how much you would be willing to pay to protect against skin cancer among the elderly. Empirical evidence suggests that people’s answers to questions, taken in isolation, are very different from their answer to questions when they are asked to engage in cross-category comparisons.43 It appears that when people assess problems in isolation, they do so by reference to other problems in the same basic category—and that this intuitive process is dramatically altered when people are explicitly told to assess problems from other categories as well. The result of assessing individual problems, taken in isolation, is to produce what people would themselves consider a form of incoherence. The cognitive argument for cost-benefit analysis, thus understood, is now in place. It is true but obvious to say that people lack information and that their lack of information can lead to an inadequate or excessive demand for regulation, or a form of “paranoia and neglect.”44 What is less obvious is that predictable features of cognition will lead to a demand for regulation that is unlikely to be based on the facts. When people ask for regulation because of fears fueled by availability cascades, and when the benefits from the risk-producing activity are not 43 See Daniel Kahneman, David Schkade, Iliana Ritov, & Cass R.Sunstein, Reversals of Judgment: The Effect of Cross-Category Comparisons on Intendedly Absolute Responses (unpublished manuscript 1999). Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis interest-groups exploit cognitive mechanisms registering, it would be highly desirable to create cost-benefit filters on their requests. When to create unwarranted fear or diminish concern with serious problems, it is desirable to have institutional safeguards. When people fail to ask for regulation for related reasons, it would be desirable to create a mechanism by which government might nonetheless act if the consequences of action would be desirable. Here too cost-benefit balancing might be desirable, as in fact it has proved to be in connection not only with the phase-out of lead but also with the Reagan Administration’s decision to phase-out CFC’s, motivated by a cost-benefit analysis suggesting that the phase-out would do far more good than harm.45 A caveat: It is entirely possible that the public demand for regulation will result from something other than cognitive errors, even if the relevant risk seems low as a statistical matter. People may think, for example, that it is especially important to protect poor children from a certain risk in a geographically isolated area, and they may be willing to devote an unusually large amount to ensure that protection. What seems to be a cognitive error may turn out, on reflection, to be a judgment of value, and a judgment that can survive reflection. I will return to this point. For the moment note two simple points. Whether an error is involved is an empirical question, subject, at least in principle, to empirical testing. And nothing in cost-benefit analysis would prevent people from devoting resources to projects that they consider worthy, even if the risk is relatively low as a statistical matter. The argument made thus far, cautious though it may seem, runs into three obvious objections. The first involves democratic considerations; the second points to the limitations of quantification; the third involves the possibility that ordinary people’s judgments are based not on cognitive limitations, but on a kind of “rival rationality.” 45 See Economic Analysis at EPA, supra note 33. See also Richard Elliot Benedick, Ozone Diplomacy: New Directions in Safeguarding the Planet 63 (1991) (Reagan administration supported aggressive regulation largely because cost-benefit analysis from the Council of Economic Advisers demonstrated that “despite the scientific and economic uncertainties, the monetary benefits of preventing future deaths from skin cancer far outweighed costs of CFC controls as estimated either by industry or by EPA”). A. Populism The first objection, populist in character, is captured by the opening quotation from Senator Biden. The objection would be that in a democracy, government properly responds to the social “demand” for law. Government does not legitimately reject that demand on the ground that cost-benefit analysis suggests that it should not act. On this view, a democratic government should be accountable. Any approach that uses efficiency, or technocratically-driven judgments, as a brake on accountability is fatally undemocratic. I have noted that the cost-benefit chart described above raised many questions. Those questions might be made into a thoroughgoing challenge to cost-benefit analysis. In an extensive discussion, Lisa Heinzerling has attempted to do precisely that.47 Heinzerling argues that many of the values depend on controversial judgments of value, and that the table itself masks those judgments. Her first point is that the table includes many regulations that were in fact rejected. Some of them were not issued on the ground that their benefits would exceed their costs. The table is also underinclusive, for many regulations have been issued that impose dramatically lower costs than many of those included on the table. But by itself this is no indictment of cost-benefit analysis. Indeed, it 46 At least assuming the decisions involve nothing peculiar or invidious, such as racial animus. Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis provides support for cost-benefit analysis insofar as it suggests that the tool has resulted in a rejection of undesirable regulations. Regulation Adjusted Cost Estimate (Thousands of 1995 dollars) Uranium Mill Tailings/Inactive (EPA 1983) Uranium Mill Tailings/Active (EPA 1983) Arsenic/Los-Arsenic Copper (EPA 1986) This table may be more accurate than Table I; certainly there are problems with any approach that assumes a 10% discount rate. But even if Heinzerling’s table is better, it offers an ironic lesson, serving largely to confirm the point that current regulatory policy suffers from poor priority-setting. The disparities here are not as dramatic, and they certainly do not establish pervasive overregulation; but they do support the view that resources are being misallocated. This, then, is a lesson about “the perils of precision.”48 Heinzerling also suggests that it “would be better if we left the picture blurry, and declined to connect the dots between all the confusing and sometimes conflictiung intuitions and evidence.”49 She is concerned that “some, probably many, people will be fooled into believing that numerical estimates of risks, costs, and benefits are impartial reflections of factual reality, in which case the likely result of increased reliance on quantification in setting regulatory policy will be that the side that best obscures the value choices implicit in its numbers will prevail.”50 There is considerable truth here; but I think that Heinzerling’s lesson is overdrawn. Truth first: If an agency says that the cost of regulation is one hundred million dollars, and the benefit seventy million dollars, we still know much less than we should. It is important to know who bears these costs, and if possible with what consequences. Will wages be lower? Whose wages? Will prices be higher? Of what products? A disaggregated picture of the benefits would also be important; what does the seventy million dollar figure represent? Consider, for example, a recent table explaining that the costs of skin cancer, from health effects of reducing tropospheric ozone, are between $290 million and $1.1 billion, with dollar subtotals for skin cancers and cataracts.51 By itself, this table is insufficiently informative to tell people what they need to know. Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis days will be saved that would otherwise be lost? How many hospitalizations will be avoided? How many asthma attacks will be prevented? It could even be useful to attempt to describe these effects in terms of “quality-adjusted life years,”52 knowing that here too, a good analyst will go back and forth between bottom lines and the judgments that go into their creation. Such arguments are convincing if cost-benefit analysis is taken to suggest a controversial position in favor of the commensurability of all goods—if costbenefit is seen to insist that people value environmental amenities, or their own lives, in the same way that they value a bank account, or if cost-benefit is taken as a metaphysical claim to the effect that all goods can be aligned along a single metric, or if five lives saved is seen as the same, in some deep sense, as $20-$30 million saved. Part of what people express, in their daily lives, is a resistance to this form of commensurability, and some goods are believed to have intrinsic as well as instrumental value.54 The existence of qualitative differences among goods fortifies the claim that any “bottom line” about costs and benefits should be supplemented with a more qualitative description of the variables involved. But cost-benefit analysis should not be seen as embodying a reductionist account of the good, and much less as a suggestion that everything is simply a “commodity” for human use. It is best taken as pragmatic instrument, agnostic on the deep issues and designed to assist people in making complex judgments where multiple goods are involved. To put it another way, cost-benefit analysis might be assessed pragmatically, or even politically, rather than metaphysically. overambitious understandings of what cost-benefit balancing entails. But it is not an argument against cost-benefit balancing. The final objection to the discussion thus far is the most fundamental. On this view, cost-benefit analysis is not desirable as a check on ordinary intuitions, because those intuitions reflect a kind of “rival rationality.” Ordinary people have a complex understanding of what it is that they want to maximize. They do not simply tabulate lives saved; they ask questions as well about whether the relevant risk is controllable, voluntary, dreaded, equitably distributed, and potentially catastrophic. Consider the Table 4. Table 4: Aggravating and mitigating factors in risk judgments Risk Traits Familiarity Aggravating Mitigating Personal control Uncontrollable Controllable Voluntariness Involuntary Voluntary Media attention Ignored by media Heavy media coverage Equity Children Unfairly distributed Equitably distributed Children at special risk Children not at risk Future generations Future generations at risk Future generations not at risk 55 See Paul Slovic, Baruch Fischhoff & Sarah Lichtenstein, Regulation of Risk: A Psychological Perspective, in Regulatory Policy and the Social Sciences 241 (Roger G. Noll ed., 1985); Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis Reversibility Irreversible Reversible Victims known Victims not identifiable Benefits clear Benefits invisible Source Human origin Created by nature Low trust in relevant institutions High trust in relevant institutions Effects delayed Effects immediate Mechanisms poorly understood Mechanisms understood Identifiability of victims Accompanying benefits Trust in relevant institutions Timing of adverse effects Understanding Precedents History of accidents No past accidents One problem with this view is that it may not be a criticism of cost-benefit analysis at all; it may suggest only that any judgment about benefits and costs (whether or not based on willingness to pay) will have to take account of people’s divergent assessments of divergent risks. In principle, there is no problem with doing exactly that. There is, however, reason to question the nowconventional view that qualitative factors of this kind in fact explain people’s disagreement with experts about certain risks of death. In fact I do not believe that the “psychometric paradigm” can defend its own central claims. The first point is technical. In the relevant studies, the key factors—voluntariness, controllability, potentially catastrophic nature—have not been generated spontaneously or independently by subjects. Instead those who conduct the relevant research ask people to rank risks along these dimensions . From this information it cannot be said that ordinary people think that these qualitative differences justify departing from the “lives saved” criterion. The evidence is simply too indirect. Chicago Working Paper in Law and Economics No doubt it is possible that people’s judgments about risk severity are a product of some of the more qualitative considerations listed above; this idea leads to the widespread view that ordinary people have a “richer” rationality than do experts, since ordinary people look at the nature and causes of death, not simply at aggregate deaths at issue. But it is also possible that an apparently “rich” judgment that a certain risk is severe, or not severe, depend not on wellconsidered judgments of value, but instead on an absence of ordinary contextual cues, on a failure to see that tradeoffs are inevitably being made, on heuristic devices that are not well-adapted to the particular context, or instead on a range of confusing or confused ideas that people cannot fully articulate. When people say, for example, that the risk of nuclear power is very serious, they may be responding to their intense visceral concern, possibly based on (uninformed) statistical judgments about likely lives at risk and on their failure to see (as they do in other contexts) that that risk is accompanied by a range of social benefits. Thus it is possible that a judgment that a certain risk of death is unusually bad is not a “rich” qualitative assessment but an (unreliable) intuition based on a rapid balancing that prominently includes perceived lives at stake and the perceived presence of small or no benefits associated with the risk-producing activity. It is often said, on the basis of evidence like that outlined above, that especially dreaded deaths deserve special attention. Deaths from cancer and AIDS fall in this category. There is nothing at all mysterious to this idea. The underlying point is probably that the relevant deaths are especially grueling and hence there is a kind of “pain and suffering premium”—not merely a life lost, but an antecedent period of intense emotional and physical difficulty as well. This period of intense difficulty might impose costs on those with the illness and on friends and family members as well. Sudden, unanticipated deaths can be point, from which I have learned a great deal. Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis dreaded too—consider the extremely unpleasant idea of dying in an airplane crash. But the dread here stems from some factor (perhaps terror) different from and much shorter than the extended period of suffering that precedes some deaths. Thus it might be concluded that dreaded deaths deserve special attention in accordance with the degree of suffering that precedes them. A special problem with cancer deaths is that at least some of the time, people like to have upwardsloping utility. It is particularly bad to be in a situation in which things will constantly get worse.60 With cancer deaths, the slope goes downward fairly consistently until the point of death. People seem to perceive voluntarily incurred risks as less troublesome than involuntarily incurred risks. Consider diverse public reactions to airplane crashes and automobile crashes. Or consider the fact that tobacco is by far the largest source of preventable deaths in the United States. Why do we not devote much more of our regulatory effort to reducing smoking? The reason seems to lie in a judgment that smoking is a voluntary activity and hence the resulting deaths are less troublesome than other sorts of deaths. Here—it might be said—people have voluntarily assumed the relevant risks. It is tempting to think that the apparent lay preference for according greater weight to “involuntary” risks to life requires significant qualification of the criterion of lives or life-years saved. But a simple reference to voluntariness, if taken to suggest something special about “lay rationality,” raises many puzzles. The most important problem is that it is not simple to know when a risk is voluntarily incurred. “Voluntariness” may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid; but voluntariness is not, in the cases under consideration, an all-or-nothing matter. Instead it is a matter of degree. Return to the conventional thought that airplane crashes are “involuntary” and automobile crashes more “voluntary.” Certainly it would be possible to see the risks from air travel as voluntarily run; people have a choice about whether to fly, and when they do fly, they pay a certain amount for a certain package, including risks of various sorts. The same is true of automobile safety—and it is not in any way less true, however disparately the two kinds of risks may “seem.” Perhaps people are responding to the perceived fact that they have no control over the pilot’s behavior, whereas they have considerable control over automobile safety since they are themselves drivers. But airlines respond to market forces, including the market for safety, and many people injured in automobile accidents are not at fault, and thus along the dimension of voluntariness this is hardly a crisp distinction. The difference between the two risks is hardly so categorical as to justify an assessment that they fall on poles of some voluntariness-involuntariness divide. Indeed, it is not clear even what is meant by the suggestion that one is voluntary and the other is not. Something else appears to underlie that suggestion. To shed some light on the issue, let us consider three classes of cases. First, consider the question whether workers exposed to cancer risks are voluntarily or involuntarily so exposed. If workers do not know about such risks—if they lack relevant information—we seem to have an easy case of involuntariness. Thus it makes sense to say that risks are run involuntarily when the people running them do not know about them. Lack of adequate information provides a legitimate case for a judgment of involuntary exposure to risk. But of course information itself can be obtained at some cost, pecuniary or otherwise. We are thus dealing, in cases of this kind, with high costs of risk avoidance, in the distinctive form of high costs of acquiring relevant information. Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis it is not clear how the two differ. The underlying judgment must be that the compensation is inadequate, perhaps because background inequality has produced a wage package that seems unfair even if voluntarily chosen by the parties. Death-risks may seem “voluntarily” run when people do not approve of the purpose for which people run the relevant risks, and involuntarily run when people think that the purpose for which the risk is run is laudable. It is predictable that people will not want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with sky-diving, even if the dollars/life-years saved ratio is quite good. By contrast, it is doubtful that people think that it is wrong to spend enormous resources on the prevention of death from childbirth or being a police officer, even though the decision to have a child is (with appropriate qualifications) voluntary, and so too with the decision to become a police officer. People may think that when the appeal or purpose of the activity is associated with its very riskiness, resources should not be devoted to risk-reduction. At least this is plausible when the risk is an independent good or part of the benefit of the activity. And it is easy to imagine a belief that some activities—unsafe sex, cigarette smoking—are like the sky-diving case, perhaps because the risk is sometimes part of the benefit, perhaps because the risks are not incurred for a purpose that observers find worthy or valuable. Chicago Working Paper in Law and Economics purpose might seem inadequate. But on reflection the two ideas are hardly the same. It may well be that failing to sky-dive, or sky-diving with some safetyincreasing technology, imposes high costs on sky-divers. There seems to be an objective judgment, not necessarily connected with subjective costs, in the claim that some risks are voluntary, or deserve less attention, because they are run for inadequate purposes. that d. Underlying questions and assumption of risk We might therefore conclude that whether a risk qualifies as involuntary raises many of the questions raised by the question whether government should regulate the market at all. A risk might be characterized as involuntarily run because affected people lack relevant information; because the transactions costs of bargaining are high; because the risks should be seen to amount to externalities; because collective action problems make market outcomes unsatisfactory since (for example) workers are in a prisoner’s dilemma best solved through law; or because some motivational or cognitive defect makes successful solutions through markets unlikely. These of course are among the conventional grounds for regulation in the first instance. When a risk seems voluntary, and not worthy of substantial regulatory resources, the term “voluntary” is serving as a placeholder for an argument that there is no sufficient ground for government action, because the accompanying benefits are high or Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis the risk-reduction costs are low, and because market arrangements take adequate account of these facts. The psychological evidence suggests, thought it does not squarely identify, important and relevant fact: Some deaths produce unusually high an externalities, in the sense that they generate widespread losses, including those stemming from empathy and fear, in a way that leads to predictable pecuniary and nonpecuniary costs. Consider, for example, the death of the President of the United States, a death that imposes a wide range of costs and that taxpayers invest significant resources to prevent. Part of the reason for allocating those resources is undoubtedly the greater risk that the President will be murdered; but the external costs associated with his death are undoubtedly important too. A parallel can be found in the relatively large level of resources devoted to prevent the assassination of many important public officials. But the point is hardly limited to the highest public officials. An airplane hijacking or crash, partly because it is likely to be well-publicized, may produce large externalities in the Chicago Working Paper in Law and Economics form of empathy and fear. It may even deter air travel by making people unusually frightened of air travel, simply because of heuristic devices (availability) and other predictable factors that make people’s probability assessments go awry. This fear may be damaging because it is itself a utility loss and because it may lead people to use less safe methods of transportation, such as automobiles. Or an airplane crash might be especially disturbing because the sudden loss of dozens or hundreds of people seems so unusually and senselessly tragic, in a way that produces large empathetic reactions, or because it signals the further possibility of random, apparently inexplicable events in which large numbers of people die. Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis lay and expert assessments rest on genuine value differences (four times as many deaths may be much more than four times as bad) rather than on factual errors in cognitive processes of ordinary people. Some risks might be, or be thought to be, inequitably distributed, above all because the victims are disproportionately members of socially disadvantaged groups. Certain deaths might, for example, be concentrated among poor people, African-Americans, or homosexuals. Consider the risk of lead paint poisoning suffered by inner city children, or the risk of AIDS, faced disproportionately by African-Americans as well as homosexuals. Citizens or elected representatives may think that inequitably distributed risks of death deserve special attention from government. Here the relevant deaths are bad not because each one is especially bad to experience, but because there is social concern about the fact that a certain cause of death falls disproportionately on members of certain social groups. 64 It is inadequate to response that potential compensation could be made to losers in the context of efficient programs; if the compensation is only potential, the concern remains. weights to risks whose distributional incidence is especially troublesome.65 These weights might take a technical form (through adding numbers to the ones that would otherwise be used) or appear via the official judgment about how to proceed after the cost-benefit analysis has been supplied (through deciding in favor of a strategy not strictly suggested by the numbers). The distributional concern supports special efforts to control AIDS; environmental risks like asthma, which are concentrated among inner city children; and perhaps the spread of diseases whose incidence is concentrated among women. My minimal claim is that if there is a public judgment in favor of according a distributional weight to a certain death-reduction policy, and if that judgment is not unconstitutional or otherwise illegitimate, policy makers should not be barred from respecting that judgment. I conclude that there is no “rival rationality,” and that people are willing to depart from the “lives saved” criterion for reasons that cast a clearer light on what it is that they are attempting to maximize. More particularly: a. People are willing to pay a premium to avoid deaths that involve a high degree of pain and suffering. At least presumptively, this desire, or judgment, should be respected by government regulators; the presumption might be rebutted if, for example, the “premium” seems so high as to suggest that some kind of irrationality is at work. 65 See the critical comments about willingness to pay in Amartya Sen, The Discipline of Cost-Benefit Analysis, J. Legal Stud. (forthcoming 2000), and in Matthew Adler and Eric A. Posner, J. Legal Stud. (forthcoming 2000). Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis glance seem to deserve special attention. The major qualification is that it may be possible to address them directly, rather than to cater (pander?) to them. Suppose, for example, that education can assure the public that flying is generally quite safe. If information can accomplish this end, it is better to provide it than to engage in regulation that is costly and that has no purpose other than to reassure. III. An Incompletely Theorized Agreement on Cost-Benefit Analysis? A. Problems With Aggregated Willingness to Pay Thus far I have suggested that cost-benefit analysis is a sensible approach to cognitive problems faced by ordinary people in the assessment of risk. I have also suggested that there is no democratic objection to using cost-benefit analysis as an ingredient in decisions, even a crucial ingredient, and that cost-benefit analysis can be understood in a way that responds to reasonable concerns about quantification and about the idea that the only thing to be maximized is total lives saved (or, somewhat better, life-years saved). 67 See Amartya Sen, The Discipline of Cost-Benefit Analysis, J. Legal Stud. (forthcoming 2000); compare the notion of cost-benefit analysis as a decision procedure in Matthew Adler and Eric A. Posner, Rethinking Cost-Benefit Analysis, 109 Yale L.J. (forthcoming 1999). Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis example, people may overstate the risks from various hazards that receive disproportionate media attention. If this is so, it seems odd to base government policy on those judgments. Second, willingness to pay is imperfectly correlated with utility—at best the first is a proxy for the second—and the two should not be confused in principle. One problem is that poor people are willing to pay less than wealthy people simply by virtue of being poor, and their willingness to pay for something (eg, a reduced mortality risk) is crudely connected with the utility that they would gain from it. In the face of disparities in wealth, willingness to pay should not be identified with expected utility or with the value actually placed on the good in question.73 Third, there is a purely distributive concern.74 Because poor people have less money than wealthy people, they are willing to pay less for equivalent goods (such as reduced risks to life). The result of the use of willingness to pay would be to produce greater expenditures to protect wealthy people than poor people, a controversial result to say the least.75 Fourth, the willingness to pay criterion will produce losers as well as winners, and many of the losers will go uncompensated; it is scant comfort to say that they could be compensated with side payments or a system of optimal taxation. Hence an attempt to defend cost-benefit analysis by reference to the efficiency criterion, as measured by private willingness to pay, runs into great difficulties, at least unless steps are taken to ensure against distributional bias.76 Fifth, and finally, there may be differences between the choices people make as consumers and the choices that they make as citizens, and it is not clear that the former should be preferred. The context of citizenship may evoke otherregarding or altruistic values, or preferences, that are not reflected in private choices. This is partly because aggregating private willingness to pay can replicate various collective action problems faced in the private domain; people may be willing to pay more simply because they know that other people are contributing as well.77 If this is so, it makes no sense to base policy on private willingness to pay, where the collective action problem arises. 76 There are some complexities here. Of course markets are ordinarily based on willingness to pay, and poor people are willing to pay less for safety, simply because they have less. Poor people are willing to pay less, as a class and other things equal, for safer cars, safer neighborhoods, and so forth. The aggregated willingness to pay approach simply generalizes this phenomenon; there is nothing unusual about it. Thus a system that assigns uniform values to life embeds a kind of subsidy, or redistribution, to people with relatively less resources or, more precisely, to people with less willingness to pay. A system of uniform values might be thought sufficient to correct any distributional bias in cost-benefits analysis. Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis numbers are far too low. Much further work remains to be done to test whether people would in fact be willing to spend more for safety, or for environmental amenities, if the result would be significant decreases in absolute income but the same relative income. Often it is possible to resolve hard questions of law and policy without resolving deeply contested issues about justice, democracy, or the appropriate aims of the state.80 Often it is possible to obtain an incompletely theorized agreement on a social practice, and even on the social or legal specification of the practice. In many areas of law and public policy, people can reach closure about what to do despite their disagreement or uncertainty about why, exactly, that ought to do it. Thus people who disagree about the purposes of the criminal law can agree that rape and murder should be punished, and punished more severely than theft and trespass. Thus people can support an Endangered Species Act amidst disagreement about whether the protection of endangered species is desirable for theological reasons, or because of the rights of animals, plants, and species, or because of the value of animals, plants, and species for human beings. A great advantage of incompletely theorized agreements is that they allow people of diverse views to live together on mutually advantageous terms. An even greater advantage is that they allow people of diverse views to show one another a high degree of both humility and mutual respect. 79 See Martha C. Nussbaum, The Fragility Of Goodness: Luck and Ethics In Greek Tragedy and Philosophy (1983); Martha Nussbaum, J. Legal Stud. (forthcoming 2000). to pay” for various social goods.81 But my basic claims here are that it should be possible for diverse people to agree on presumptive floors and ceilings for regulatory expenditures, and that the presumptions can do a great deal of useful work for policymaking and for law. In short, a great deal can be done without confronting the hardest theoretical questions raised by contentious specifications of cost-benefit analysis. Here, then, are eight propositions, offered in the hope that they might attract support from diverse theoretical standpoints. I do not attempt to defend them in detail here; The goal is to provide a starting point for the effort to anchor costbenefit analysis in an incompletely theorized agreement about regulatory policies. Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis 1. Agencies should identify the advantages and disadvantages of proposed courses of action, and also attempt to quantify the relevant effects to the extent that this is possible. When quantification is not possible, agencies should discuss the relevant effects in qualitative terms, and also specify a range of plausible outcomes, e.g., annual savings of between 150 and 300 lives, or savings of between $100 million and $300 million, depending on the rate of technological change. The statement should include the full range of beneficial effects. The problem of particulates and ozone regulation poses some serious difficulties to challengers to cost-benefit analysis (CBA); if the EPA is not to do a form of CBA, what is it to do, concretely? 2. The quantitative description should supplement rather than displace a qualitative description of relevant effects. Both qualitative and quantitative descriptions should be provided. It is important to know the nature of the relevant effects, e.g., lost workdays, cancers averted, respiratory problems averted. To the extent possible, the qualitative description should give a concrete sense of who is helped and who is hurt, e.g., whether the beneficiaries are mostly or partly children, whether the regulation will lead to lost jobs, higher prices, more poverty, and so forth. Where the only possible information is speculative, this should be noted, along with the most reasonable speculations. Chicago Working Paper in Law and Economics governmental measures point in the same basic direction.83 OMB should establish presumptive floors and ceilings for various regulatory benefits. If an agency is going to spend (say) no more than $500,000 per life saved, or more than $20 million, it should have to explain itself. Actual agency practice reveals a mixed record. EPA now values a life at $4.8 million; some agencies go as high as $5.6 or as low as $1; and some agencies do not provide specific numbers at all. 6. Agencies should be permitted to make adjustments on the basis of the various “qualitative” factors discussed above. For example, they might add a “pain and suffering premium,” or increase the level of expenditure because children are disproportionately affected or because the victims are members of a disadvantaged group. It would be reasonable to conclude that because AIDS has disproportionate adverse effects on homosexuals and poor people, special efforts should be made to ensure against AIDS-related deaths. To the extent possible, they should be precise about the nature of, and grounds for, the relevant adjustments, especially in light of the risk that interest-group pressures will convert allegedly qualitative adjustments in illegitimate directions.85 83 Note, however, that if relative position is what matters, these numbers may be too low, for reasons stated above. Cognition and Cost-Benefit Analysis 7. The appropriate response to social fear not based on evidence, and to related “ripple effects,” is education and reassurance rather than increased regulation. Sometimes public concern about certain risks is general and intense, even though the concern is not merited by the facts.86 The best response is educational; the government should not expend significant resources merely because an uninformed public believes that it should. But if education and reassurance fail, increased regulation may be defensible as a way of providing a kind of reassurance in the face of intense fears, which can themselves impose high costs of various kinds. (Consider, for example, the possibility that people who afraid of risks of plane crashes will shift to driving, a more risky method of transportation; consider also the fact that the fear is itself a cost.) 8. Unless the statute requires otherwise, judicial review of risk regulation should require a general showing that regulation has produced more good than harm, on a reasonable view about valuation of both benefits and costs.87 On this view, courts should generally require agencies to generate and to adhere to ceilings and floors. But they should also allow agencies to depart from conventional numbers (by, for example, valuing a life at less than $1 million, or more than $10 million) if and only if the agency has given a reasonable explanation of why it has done so. The ultimate task would be develop a kind of “common law” of cost-benefit analysis, authorizing agencies to be law-making institutions in the first instance.88 I have suggested that cost-benefit analysis, often defended on economic grounds, can be urged less contentiously on cognitive grounds. Cost-benefit analysis, taken as an inquiry into the consequences of varying approaches to regulation,89 is a sensible response not only to interest-group power, but also to limited information and to predictable problems in the public demand for regulation. These problems include the use of the availability heuristic; social amplification of that heuristic via cascade effects; a failure to see the benefits that 87 See Margolis, supra note. accompany certain risks; a misunderstanding of systemic effects, which can lead to unanticipated bad (and good) consequences; and certain emotional reactions to risks. In all of these areas, an effort to identify costs and benefits can properly inform analysis. Cass R. Sunstein Karl N.
