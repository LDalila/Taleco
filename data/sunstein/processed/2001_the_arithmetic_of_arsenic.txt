The Arithmetic of Arsenic

CASS  R.  SUNSTEIN*

ABSTRACT

What does  cost-benefit analysis  mean,  or do,  in actual  practice?  When  agencies
engage  in cost-benefit balancing, what are  the  interactions among  law, science, and
economics?  This  Article  attempts  to  answer  that  question  by  exploring,  in  some
detail,  the  controversy  over  the  EPA's  proposed  regulation  of arsenic  in  drinking
water  The  largest finding is  that often  science  can  produce  only  "benefit  ranges, "
and  wide  ones  at  that.  With  reasonable  assumptions  based  on  the  scientific  data
before  the  EPA  at  the  time  it  made  its  initial  decision,  the  proposed  arsenic
regulation  can  be  projected  to  save  as few  as  0  lives  and  as  many  as  112.  With
reasonable  assumptions,  the monetized  benefits of the  regulation  can  range from  $0
to  $560  million.  In  these  circumstances,  there  is  no  obviously  right  decision for
government agencies  to make.  These points  have  numerous implications for lawyers
and  courts,  suggesting  both  the  ease  of bringing  legal  challenges  on  grounds
specified  here  and  the  importance  of judicial  deference  in  the face  of scientific
uncertainty.  There  are  also  policy  implications.  Agencies  should  be  given  the
authority  to  issue  more  targeted,  cost-effective  regulations.  They  should  also  be
required to accompany the cost-benefit analysis with an effort  to identify the  winners
and losers, to see if poor people are mostly hurt or mostly helped.

Americans  may  disagree  on  a  lot  of things,  but  drinking  arsenic  isn't  one  of
them  ....  When  you  turn  on  the  kitchen  sink,  you  ought  to  be  able  to  drink
what comes out, without worrying  about  being  poisoned.'

"What  we  know  is  a  drop,  what  we  do  not  know-an  ocean."  In  spite  of
significant  gains  in  knowledge,  we  are  still  moving  mainly  in  the  dark  when
dealing  with  the quantitative  importance of risk factors  in chemical  carcinogen-
esis,  the  mechanisms  of  action  of  chemical  carcinogens,  and  hence,  their
detection  and  the  assessment  of  their  risks  to  human  health.  The  basic
understanding...  is  still missing.2

Because  the  shape  of  the dose-response  curve  in  the  low-dose  region  cannot

correct.... 
[W]hen  modeling  the  risks  associated  with  lower  doses,  the

INTRODUCTION

Within  the  past  two  decades,  cost-benefit  analysis  (CBA)  has  become  one  of
the  most  widely  discussed  topics  in  all  of  regulatory  law. 6  Much  of  the
discussion  is  occurring  within  the  three  branches  of government.  The  Office  of
Management  and  Budget  (OMB)  has  overseen  a  series  of  executive  orders
calling  for  cost-benefit  balancing,7  and  OMB  has  attempted  to  give  concrete
guidance  for  agencies  to  follow. 8  Courts  have  adopted  a  series  of  cost-benefit
default  principles,  authorizing  agencies  to  engage  in  cost-benefit  balancing
unless  Congress  requires  otherwise. 9  Congress  itself  has  shown  considerable
interest  in requiring  agencies  to compile  information  on the  costs  and benefits  of
regulation.' °  At  the  same  time,  there  has  been  renewed  academic  interest  in
CBA,  resulting  in  explorations  of the  technique  from  a  remarkable  variety  of

perspectives. "

In all  of these  contexts, the  discussion  has  tended  to be  quite  abstract.  Within
the  legal  culture,  there  has  been  little  discussion  of  what  CBA  specifically
entails  or  of  how  the  technique  might  be  used  or improved  by  agencies. 12  To
date,  there  appears  to  be  no  sustained  investigation  within  the  legal  culture  of
any  regulation  in  which  CBA  proved  pivotal  to  the  outcome.  In  this  Article,  I
hope  to  begin  to  fill  the  gap.  I  do  so  by  exploring  one  of  the  most  contested
early  decisions  of the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  under President
George  W. Bush:  the  suspension  of  the  EPA  regulation  of  arsenic  in  drinking
water.' 3 Much  of the contest  over that  decision  has  involved  a  debate  about  the
relevant  costs  and  benefits  of  the  regulation.  As  we  will  see,  it  is  possible  to
draw  a range  of general  lessons  from the  arsenic  controversy.

My  principal  finding  is  simple:  Sometimes  the  best  that  can  be  done  is  to
specify  an  exceedingly  wide  "benefits  range,"  one  that  does  not  do a  great deal
to  discipline  judgment.  Much  of this Article  will be  devoted  to establishing  this
insufficiently  appreciated  point,  with  some  effort  to  specify  the judgments  that
must  be  made  both  to  identify  the  health  benefits  and  to  monetize  them.  As  a
result  of  this  finding,  it  would  be  wrong  to  have  confidence  that  the  EPA's
proposed  rule  in the  Clinton  Administration  was  either  right or wrong,  based  on
the  evidence  before  the  agency  at  the  time.  I  also  offer  three  more  positive
suggestions.  First, CBA,  even  with wide  ranges,  provides  an important  improve-
ment  over the  "intuitive  toxicology"  of ordinary  people,  in  which  general  affect
helps  to  determine  judgment.' 4  This  intuitive  toxicology  can  lead  people  to
large  blunders  in  thinking  about  risk,  not  excluding  the  public's  excessive
reaction  to the  Bush Administration's  decision  to suspend  the arsenic  rule  issued
by  the  Clinton  Administration.- 5  Second,  considerable  progress  could  be  made
by  authorizing  the  EPA  both  to  use  market  incentives  and  to  target  drinking
water  controls  to  areas  where  they  would  do  the  most  good.  Third,  the  EPA
should  be  required  to  provide,  if  feasible,  a  distributional analysis  showing
exactly  who  would  be  helped  and  hurt by  regulation.  In  its  voluminous  materi-
als  on  the  effects  of the  new  arsenic  rule,  for  example,  the  EPA  does  not  say  a

compiled  by  the  EPA at the  time that  it made  its  decision; subsequent  to  that decision,  new evidence  has
been  found  and discussed,  giving  rise to  increased fears  about the  risks  posed  by  arsenic. See  SUBCOMM.
ON  ARSENIC  IN  DRINKING  WATER,  NAT'L  RESEARCH  COUNCIL,  ARSENIC  IN DRINKING  WATER:  2001  UPDATE.  In
part  as  a  result  of this  evidence,  the  EPA  has  decided  to  go  forward  with  the  Clinton  Administration
initiative. See  Katherine  Q.  Seelye,  EPA to Adopt Clinton Arsenic Standard, N.Y. TIMES,  Nov.  1, 2001,

word  about  whether  poor  people  would  bear  the  sometimes  significant  costs  of
the  regulation.  It  would  be  easier  to  assess  the  new  rule  with  a  clearer  sense  of
the benefited  and  burdened  classes.

More  particularly,  I  suggest  that  an  understanding  of the  arsenic  controversy

offers  seven  general  lessons:

(1)  The  illusion of  certainty. CBA  can  sometimes  produce  an  illusion  of
certainty.' 6  Even  when,  as  in  the  arsenic  case,  science  has  a  great  deal  to
offer,  the  most  that  the  agency  can  be  expected  to  do may  be  to  specify  a
range,  sometimes  a wide  range,  without  assigning  probabilities  to  various
points  along  the  spectrum.  This  suggestion  should  be  taken  as  an  attack
not  on  CBA,  but  on  what  might  be  described  as  the  false  promise  of
CBA:  the  thought  that  science  and  economics,  taken  together,  can  pro-
duce  bottom  lines  to  be  mechanically  applied  by  regulatory  agencies.
"[T]here  is  wide  recognition  among  experts-but  not  necessarily  in  the
public  opinion-that  current  approaches  to  the  regulation  of most  agents
remain judgmental."  17

(2)  The  wide benefits range. With respect  to health  benefits,  plausible  assump-
tions  can lead  in dramatically  different  directions.  In  the case of arsenic,  it
would  be  possible  to conclude  that  the annual  number of lives  saved  from
the  EPA's  proposed  regulation  would  be  as  low  as  5  or  as  high  as
112-and  that  the  annual  monetized  benefits  of  the  proposed  standard
would  be  as  high as  $1.2  billion  or as low  as  $10  million!  It  is  worthwhile
to  pay  special  attention  to  the  dose-response curve,  on  which  direct
information  is  typically  absent.  I  will  make  a  particular  effort  to  connect
the  legal  and  economic  issues  involved  in  cost-benefit  balancing  to  the
underlying  scientific  questions.

(3)  The  potentially  extraordinary power  of creative  lawyers.  If  literate  in
some  basic science  and  economics,  an  adroit lawyer,  on  either side,  might
mount apparently  reasonable  challenges  to any EPA decision  about  whether
and  how  to  regulate  arsenic  in  drinking  water. An  industry  lawyer  should
be able  to urge,  not  without some  force,  that  any new  regulation of arsenic
is  too  severe,  because  the  costs  exceed  the  benefits.  An  environmental
lawyer  should  be  able  to  urge,  not  without  some  force,  that  nearly  any
imaginable  regulation  of  arsenic  is  too  lenient,  because  the  benefits  of
further  regulation  would  exceed  the  costs.  Both  challenges  would  be
plausible  for a simple  reason:  It is easy  to identify  assumptions  that  would
drive  the  numbers  up  or  down.  Hence  one  of  my  principal  goals  is  to
provide  a  kind  of primer  on  how  informed  lawyers  can  integrate  science,
economics,  and  law  to challenge  regulatory  outcomes.

(4)  The need for judicial deference. In part  because  of point three,  and  in  light
of the  scientific  and economic  complexities,  courts  should play  an  exceed-
ingly  deferential  role  in  overseeing  CBA  at  the  agency  level.  To  say  the
least, judges  are  not  specialists  in  the  relevant  topics,  some  of  which  are
highly  technical,  and  because  good lawyers  will  be  able  to  raise  so  many
plausible  doubts,  the  best  judicial  posture  is  one  of  deference.  In  the
arsenic  case  and  in  many  other  contexts,  agencies  must  decide  in  the
midst  of considerable  scientific  uncertainty  and  on  the  basis  of judgments
of  value  on  which  reasonable  people  can  differ.  If  agencies  have  been
both  open  and  reasonable,  the  judicial  role  is  at  an  end.  It  follows,  for
example,  that  the  Clinton  Administration's  arsenic  rule,  if  it  had  been
finally  issued  and challenged,  should  have  survived judicial review.  It also
follows  that  a  less  stringent  regulation,  if it had  been  chosen  by  the  Bush
Administration,  should  survive judicial  review  too. The  claim  for judicial
deference, 
in  both  cases,  is  rooted  in  institutional  considerations  and
above  all  a sense  of the likely  problems  of intensive judicial  review-not
in  approval  of  any  particular  agency  decision.  Of  course  courts  should
invalidate  arbitrary  or  indefensible  judgments,  but  the  EPA's  approach
here  was  neither arbitrary  nor indefensible.

(5)  CBA  as  indispensable  information.  The  false  precision  of  CBA  is  a
significant  cautionary  note,  but  it  should  not  be  taken  as  a  fundamental
attack  on  the  method  itself,  at  least  if  CBA  is  understood  as  a  way  of
compiling  relevant  information.  In  the  arsenic  case,  an  assessment  of
costs  and  benefits  cannot  determine  the  appropriate  regulatory  outcome.
But even  so,  the  assessment  is  indispensable  to  informing  the  inquiry  and
to  ensuring  that  discretion  is  exercised  in  a way  that  is  transparent  rather
than  opaque.  Without  some  effort  to  ascertain  the  effects  of  regulation,
agencies  are  making  a  mere  stab  in  the  dark.  At  the  very  least,  an
understanding  of the data  helps  show  exactly  why the decision about how
to  regulate arsenic is genuinely difficult-and why, and where,  reasonable
people  might differ. This  is itself a  significant  gain.

(6)  Targeting. The  Safe  Drinking  Water  Act  (SDWA), 18  designed  to  control
pollution  in  drinking  water,  has  been  amended  to  require  cost-benefit
balancing,  partly to  permit the  EPA to  relax  regulatory requirements  when
the  benefits  are  low  and  the  costs  are  high.' 9  At  the same  time,  however,
the  SDWA  continues  to  have  a  high  degree  of  rigidity.  The  EPA  is  not
authorized  to  impose  regulation  selectively  or  in  those  areas  in  which
regulation  would  do  the  most  good;  it  is  required  to  proceed  with  a
uniform,  national  regulation. 20  The  EPA  is  also  forbidden  to  create  trad-
ing  programs,  which  might  well  make  best  sense  for  some  pollutants.
Statutory  amendments  would  be  sensible  here,  especially  under  a  statute

dedicated  to  cost-benefit  balancing.  Regulatory  statutes  generally  should
authorize  agencies  to  target  regulations  to  areas  where  the benefits  exceed
the  costs  and  should  also  allow  agencies  to  use  market  incentives  when
appropriate. 2 '

(7)  The  importance  of  distributional information.  It  would  be  extremely
valuable  to  assemble  information  about  the  distributional consequences
of regulation. The benefits  of some  regulations  are  enjoyed  disproportion-
ately  by  people  who  are  poor  and  members  of  minority  groups. 22  The
burdens  of  some  regulations  are  imposed  disproportionately  on  exactly
the  same  groups.  To  assess  the  arsenic  rule,  it  would  be  highly  desirable
to  know  whether  poor  people  are  mostly  helped  or  mostly  hurt.  Would
they  bear  high  costs?  Would  the  regulation  operate  as  a  regressive  tax?
Unfortunately,  the  EPA  has  not  answered  that  question,  though  it  would
almost  certainly  be  easy  for  it to  do  so.  Existing  executive  orders  calling
for CBA  should  be  amended  to  require  a careful  distributional  analysis  as
well.23

This  Article  comes  in  several  parts.  Part  I  offers  a  general  overview  of the
movement  toward  cost-benefit  balancing,  a  movement  in  which  the  SDWA
stands  as  the  most  dramatic  legislative  endorsement.  It  also  gives  a  brief
description  of the  public  outcry  over  President  Bush's  decision  to  suspend  the
regulation,  to  fortify  the  case  for  CBA.  Part  II  provides  a  brief  outline  of the
SDWA  and  of the  EPA's  rationale  in  its  regulation  of arsenic.  Part  III explores
the  very  different  analysis  coming  from  the  American  Enterprise  Institute-
Brookings  (AEI-Brookings)  Joint  Center  for  Regulatory  Studies.  Part  IV-in
many  ways  the heart  of the  Article-shows  how  apparently  reasonable  assump-
tions  lead  to  a  dramatically  diverse  set  of benefit  numbers,  both  monetized  and
nonmonetized.  Part  V  explores  how  lawyers  and  courts  might  respond  to  the
data.  Part  VI  discusses  the  role  of  policymakers  and  explains  that  agencies
should  be  permitted  to issue  targeted  regulations  and  to  use economic  incentives
and  that,  in  keeping  with  its  informational  functions,  CBA  should  include  a
description  of the  expected  winners  and  losers from regulation.

21.  I  do not  explore  here the  question  whether  national  standards  make  sense  for  drinking  water,  as
opposed  to  reliance  on  state  regulation.  For  a  pertinent  discussion  of  this  question,  see  Richard  L.

THE  ARITHMETIC  OF ARSENIC

2261

I.  INTUITIVE  TOXICOLOGY  AND  THE  COST-BENEFIT  STATE

A.  ARSENIC  AND  THE  PUBLIC

My  principal  topic  will  be  the  contest  over  the  appropriate  analysis  of
existing  data  relating  to  arsenic,  but it  will  be  useful  to  begin  with  a  puzzle.  In
April  2001,  the  Bush  Administration  suspended  the  Clinton  Administration's
arsenic  regulation  after  calling  for  further  study.2 4  There  seems  to  be  little
question that  of all the  controversial  environmental  actions of the Bush Adminis-
tration's  first  year, the  suspension  of the  arsenic  rule  produced  the  most  intense
reaction.

A national  survey,  conducted between April  21  and April  26,  2001,  found  that
fifty-six  percent  of Americans  rejected  the  Bush  decision,  whereas  only  thirty-
four  percent  approved  of  it-and  that  majorities  of  Americans  opposed  the
decision  in  every  region  of  the  nation.  At  various  points,  the  public  outcry
combined  concern,  certainty,  and  cynicism.  "Arsenic  Everywhere,  and  Bush  is
Not Helping,"  according  to  one  newspaper.2 6  "You  may  have  voted  for him, but
you  didn't  vote  for  this  in  your  water,"  wrote  the  Wall  Street Journal.2 7  In  an
editorial,  the  New  York  Times  demanded  that  "Americans  should  expect  their
drinking  water  to  be  at  least  as  safe  as  that  of  Japan,  Jordan,  Namibia  and
Laos,"  all  of which  impose  a  10  parts  per  billion  (ppb)  standard.2 8 A respected
journalist  asked,  "How  callous  can  you  get,  Mr.  Compassionate  Conserva-
tive? '29 The public  reaction  came to  a head  during  the  legislative  debates  on  the
issue,  particularly  within  the House  of Representatives,  which  voted  to reinstate
the Clinton  rule on the theory  that arsenic  "is  a  poison.' '3°

Here  is  the  puzzle:  With  respect  to  arsenic,  the  underlying  issues  are  highly
technical,  and  very  few people  are expert  on the  risks  posed  by exposure  to  low
levels  of arsenic.  What  accounts  for the  public  outcry?  I  believe  that  the  reason
is simple:  Arsenic was involved,  and  so  was drinking water.

These  two facts  made  the controversy  seem highly  accessible,  and  it was  easy
to  be  outraged.  Why  was  the  Bush  Administration  allowing  dangerously  high
levels  of arsenic  to  remain  in  drinking  water?  This  appeared  to  be  a  rhetorical
question.  By  contrast,  many  environmental  problems  are  both  obscure  and

technical,  and  people  do not  have an  easy  or intuitive  handle on  them.  Is  carbon
dioxide  a  serious  problem?  Most  people  have  no  idea.  But  arsenic  is  well-
known,  and  it is  well-known  to  be  a poison,  not least because  of the exceedingly
popular movie, Arsenic and Old Lace.3 1 An influential  environmental  group,  the
Natural  Resources  Defense  Council,  exploited  exactly  this  reference  with  its
work  on  the  arsenic  problem,  under  the  title,  Arsenic  and  Old  Laws. 32  The
public  reaction  would  have  been  different  if the  controversy  involved  a  water
contaminant  with  an obscure  name,  such  as  cadmium.

Ordinary  people  seem  to  be  "intuitive  toxicologists,"  with  a  set  of  simple
rules  for  thinking  about  environmental  risks.33  Among  those  simple  rules  is  a
belief that  substances  that  cause  cancer  are unsafe  and  should  be  banned.34  That
intuitive  toxicology does  not  easily  make  room  for issues  of degree.  It does  not
accommodate  the  judgment  that  low  levels  of  admittedly  carcinogenic  sub-
stances  should  sometimes  be tolerated  because  the risks  are  low  and  the costs  of
eliminating  them  are  high.  It  does  not  show  an  understanding  of  the  different
imaginable  dose-response  curves  and  the  possibility  of safe  thresholds  or  even
benefits  from low  exposure levels. 35

As  part  of intuitive  toxicology,  people  rely  on  the  "affect  heuristic,"  through
which  rapid,  even  automatic  responses  greatly  affect  judgments  about  risks.36
Consider,  for  example,  the  remarkable  fact  that  stock  prices  increase  signifi-
cantly  on  sunny  days,  a  fact  that  is  hard  to explain  in  terms  that  do not  rely  on
affect. 37  With  respect  to  risks,  affect often  operates  as a  kind  of mental  shortcut,
substituting  itself  for  a  more  careful  inquiry  into  consequences.3 8  Something
very  much  of this sort has  happened  with  the Bush  Administration's  suspension
of the  arsenic  standard,  partly  because  of skepticism  about  President  Bush,  but
mostly  because  of the  associations  of arsenic.  "If there  is  one  thing  we  all  seem
to  agree  on  is  that  we  do  not  want  arsenic  in  our  drinking  water.  It  is  an
extremely  potent  human  carcinogen  .... It is  this  simple:  arsenic  is  a  killer." 39
We  could  easily  imagine  public  outrage  over  any  decision  to  allow  arsenic  in
drinking  water, even  if the  permissible  level  were  exceedingly  low. The  outrage
would  likely  be  promoted  by  cascade  effects  in  which  people's  concern  would

be  heightened  by  the  fact  that  other  people  were  concerned.  Indeed,  the  Bush
Administration's  suspension  of the  arsenic  rule seems  to  have  created  a  cascade
effect  in  which  many  people  objected  to  the  suspension  because  other  (reason-
able)  people  seemed  to  have  objected.4 °  In  fact  one  of  the  most  compelling
arguments,  within  both  the  House  of  Representatives  and  the  public  at  large,
was  that  other  countries  regulated  arsenic  at the  level  of stringency  proposed  in
the  Clinton Administration. 4 1 The practices  of other countries  seemed  to  operate
as  a  kind  of mental  shortcut,  showing  what  it  is  right  to  do-notwithstanding
the reasonable  questions  that  might be  asked  about the  scientific  bases  for those
practices.

There  is  a  deeper  point  here.  The  problems  in  intuitive  toxicology  and  the
crudeness  of  the  affect  heuristic  seem  strongly  to  support  the  use  of  CBA,4 2
understood  not  as a  way  to  stop  regulation,  but to  ensure  that when  government
acts,  it does  so  with  some  understanding  of the likely  consequences.  CBA might
well  be  understood  as  a  way  of  moving  beyond  intuitive  toxicology  toward  a
form  of  toxicology  that  is  actually  supported  by  data.  This  point  raises  some
much  larger  issues,  involving  significant  trends  in  the  nature  of  government
regulation,  to which  I now  turn.

B.  THE  EMERGING  COST-BENEFIT  STATE

More  than  any  other  federal  statute,  the  SDWA,  as  a  result  of  the  1996
amendments,  reflects  a  strong commitment  to  cost-benefit  balancing.  The rise of
interest  in  cost-benefit  balancing  signals  a  dramatic  shift  from  the  initial  stages
of  national  risk  regulation.  Those  stages  were  undergirded  by  what  might  be
called  "1970s  environmentalism,"  which  placed  a  high  premium  on immediate
responses  to  long-neglected  problems,  emphasized  the  existence  of  problems
rather  than their  magnitude,  and  was  often  rooted  in  moral  indignation  directed
at  the  behavior  of  those  who  created  pollution  and  other  risks  to  safety  and
health.4 3  Important  aspects  of  1970s  environmentalism  can  be  found  in  the
apparently  cost-blind  national  ambient  air  quality  provisions  of the  Clean  Air
Act44 and  in  statutory  provisions  requiring  that  standards  be  set  by reference  to
"the best  available  technology"  without  a requirement  of cost-benefit  balancing
or even  an effort to quantify  benefits. 45

It is  clear  that  1970s  environmentalism  has  done  a  great  deal  of good.  It  has

THE  GEORGETOWN  LAW  JOURNAL

helped  to  produce  dramatic  improvements  in  many  domains,  above  all  in  the
context  of air  pollution,  where  ambient  air  quality  has  improved  for  all  major
pollutants.4 6  Indeed,  1970s  environmentalism  appears,  by  most  accounts,  to
survive  cost-benefit  balancing,  producing  aggregate  benefits  in  the  trillions  of
dollars,  well  in  excess  of  the  aggregate  Costs. 4 7  But  even  though  the  overall
picture  is  no cause  for  alarm,  a  closer  look  at  federal  regulatory  policy  shows  a
wide range  of problems.

Perhaps  foremost  is  the  problem  of exceptionally  poor  priority-setting,  with
substantial  resources  sometimes  going  to  small  problems  and  with  little  atten-
tion  paid  to  some  serious  problems.4 8  The  point  has  been  dramatized  by
repeated  demonstrations 
that  some  regulations  create  significant  substitute
risks49-and 
that  with cheaper,  more effective  tools, regulation  could achieve  its
basic  goals  while  saving  billions  of  dollars. 50  According  to  one  study,  each
embodying  admittedly  rough  calculations,  better  allocations  of health  expendi-
tures  could  save  60,000  additional  lives  each  year  at  no  additional  cost-and
better  allocations  could  maintain  the  current  level  of  lives  saved  with  $31
billion in  annual  savings.5 1

In  these  circumstances,  the  most  attractive  parts  of the  movement  for  CBA
have  not been  rooted  in  especially  controversial  judgments  about  what govern-
ment  ought  to  be  doing.  They  have  been  rooted  instead  in  a  more  mundane
search  for  pragmatic  instruments  designed  to  reduce  the  problems  of  poor
priority-setting,  excessively  costly  tools,  and  inattention  to  the  unfortunate
side-effects  of regulation.  By  drawing  attention  to  costs  and  benefits,  it  should
be  possible  to  spur  the  most  obviously  desirable  regulations,  to  deter  the  most
obviously  undesirable  ones,  to  encourage  a  broader  view  of consequences,  and
to  promote  a  search  for  least-cost  methods  of  achieving  regulatory  goals.5 z
Notice  here  that  so  defended,  CBA  is  not  only  an  obstacle  to  unjustified
regulation;  it  should  be  a  spur  to  government  as  well,  showing  that  regulation
should  attend  to  neglected  problems.  If  cost-benefit  balancing  is  supported  on
these  highly  pragmatic  grounds,  the  central  question  is  whether  that  form  of

balancing  is  actually  producing  what  can  be  taken  as  policy  improvements  by
people with  diverse  views about  appropriate  policy.

On  these  counts,  the  record  of CBA-at  least  within  the  EPA-is  generally
encouraging. 53  Assessments  of  costs  and  benefits  has,  for  example,  helped
produce  more  stringent  and rapid  regulation  of lead  in gasoline,  promoted  more
stringent  regulation  of  lead  in  drinking  water,  led  to  stronger  controls  on  air
pollution  at the Grand Canyon  and  the  Navajo Generating  Station,  and produced
a  reformulated  gasoline  rule  that  promotes  stronger  controls  on air  pollutants.5 4
In  these  areas,  CBA,  far  from  being  only  a  check  on  regulation,  has  indeed
spurred  government  attention  to  serious problems.

CBA has  also  led  to regulations  that  accomplish  statutory  goals  at  lower  cost, or
that  do  not  devote  limited  private  and  public  resources  to  areas  where  they  are
unlikely  to do  much  good. For regulation  of sludge,  protection of farm workers,  water
pollution  regulation  for  the  Great  Lakes,  and  controls  on  organic  chemicals,  CBA
helped  regulators  produce  modifications  that  significantly  reduced  costs.55  With  re-
spect  to  asbestos,  an  analysis  of  benefits  and  costs  led  the  EPA  to  tie  the  schedule
for phasing  down  (and eventually  largely  eliminating)  asbestos  to the  costs  of substi-
tutes  and  also  to  exempt  certain  products  from  a  flat  ban.5 6  With  respect  to  lead  in
gasoline  and  control  of chlorofluorocarbons  (destructive  of  the  ozone  layer),  CBA
helped  promote  the  use  of  economic  incentives  rather  than  command-and-control
regulation.5 7  In  this  case,  economic  incentives  are  much  cheaper  and  make  more
stringent  regulation  possible  in  the  first  place.  For modem  government,  one  of  the
most serious  problems appears  to be not agency  use  of CBA, but frequent noncompli-
ance  with executive  branch requirements  that agencies  engage in  such analysis. 58

Of course,  CBA is  hardly uncontroversial.5 9  Insofar  as  both costs  and  benefits
are  measured  by  the  economic  criterion  of "private  willingness  to  pay,"  there
are  many  problems.  Poor  people  often  have  little  ability  and  hence  little
willingness  to  pay. Some  people  will be  inadequately  informed  and  hence  show
unwillingness  to  pay  for  benefits  that  would  make  their  lives  go  better.6 °
Perhaps  regulatory  agencies  should  seek  not  private  willingness  to  pay,  but
public  judgments  as  expressed  in  public  arenas. 6'  Society  is  not  best  taken  as

some  maximizing  machine  in  which  aggregate  output  is  all  that  matters.  Some-
times  a  regulation  producing  $5  million  in  benefits  but  $6  million  in  costs  will
be  worthwhile,  if  those  who  bear  the  costs  (perhaps  representing  dollar  losses
alone?)  can  do  so  easily,  and  if  those  who  receive  the  benefits  (perhaps
representing  lives  and  illnesses  averted?)  are  especially  needy.

In  view  of these  problems,  the  strongest  arguments  for cost-benefit  balancing
are  based  not only-or even  mostly--on  neoclassical  economics,  but  also on  an
understanding  of  human  cognition,  on  democratic  considerations,  and  on  an
assessment  of the  real-world  record  of such  balancing.6 2  All  of these  points  are
directly  relevant  to  the  arsenic  controversy.  Begin  with  cognition:  Ordinary
people  have  difficulty  calculating  probabilities,  and  they  tend  to  rely  on rules of
thumb,  or  heuristics,  that  can  lead  them  to  make  systematic  errors.6 3  CBA  is  a
natural  corrective  here.  Because  of  intense  emotional  reactions  to  particular
incidents,  people  often  make  mistakes  in  thinking  about  the  seriousness  of
certain  risks. 64  Cost-benefit  balancing  should  help  government  resist  demands
for regulation  that are  rooted in  misperceptions  of facts.  Unless  people  are asked
to  seek  a  full  accounting,  they  are  likely  to  focus  on  small  parts  of problems,
producing  inadequate  or  even  counterproductive  solutions.65  CBA  is  a  way  of
producing  that  full  accounting.

With  respect  to  democracy,  the  case  for  CBA is  strengthened  by the  fact  that
interest-groups  are  often  able to  use  these  cognitive  problems  strategically, thus
fending  off  regulation  that  is  desirable  or  pressing  for  regulation  when  the
argument  on  its  behalf  is  fragile.6 6  Here  CBA,  taken  as  an  input  into  decisions,
can  protect  democratic  processes  by  exposing  an  account  of  consequences  to
public  view.  With  respect  to  pragmatic  considerations,  a  review  of the  record
suggests  that cost-benefit  balancing  leads  to improvements,  not on any controver-
sial view  of how  to  value  the goods  at  stake,  but  simply  because  such  balancing
can  lead  to  more  stringent  regulation  of serious  problems,  less  costly  ways  of
achieving  regulatory  goals,  and  a  reduction  in  expenditures  for  problems  that
are,  by  any  account,  relatively  minor.67  All  of  these  points  help  explain  the
content  of the  SDWA,  as  we  shall now  see.

THE  ARITHMETIC  OF ARSENIC

2267

II.  DRINKING  WATER:  CONGRESS  AND  THE  EPA

A.  STATUTORY  BACKGROUND

Regulatory  statutes  typically  instruct  agencies  to  require  as  much  as  "fea-
sible ' 68  or  to  "protect  the  public  health. ' 69  Only  a  few  such  statutes  expressly
require  agency  decisions  to  turn  on  cost-benefit  balancing. 70  The  SDWA  is  an
intriguing  hybrid,  combining  an  analysis  of  public  health  and  feasibility  with
reference  to  CBA  as  well.  Indeed,  the  cost-benefit  provisions  of the  SDWA  go
as far as any other federal  statute in requiring  close  attention to costs  and benefits,  and
because  Congress  has  been  quite  interested  in  imposing  more  general  cost-
benefit  requirements,7 '  the  SDWA  might  well  be  a  harbinger  of the  future.  For
this reason  alone,  the  implementation  of the  statute is worth  careful attention.

More  particularly, the  SDWA asks  the EPA  to proceed  in  three steps.  First, the
EPA  is  asked  to  set  "maximum  contaminant  level  goals"  (MCLG)  for  water
pollutants.72  The  goals  must  be  set  "at  the  level  at  which  no  known  or
anticipated  adverse  effects  on  the  health  of persons  occur  and  which  allows  an
adequate  margin  of safety. ' 73 In  practice,  this  statutory  standard  will  frequently
call  for  a  MCLG  of zero  because  many  contaminants  cannot  be  shown  to  have
safe  thresholds  and  because  the  "adequate  margin  of  safety"  language  will,  in
these  specific  circumstances,  seem to  support  a  zero  MCLG. 4  Second,  the  EPA
is  told  to  specify  "a  maximum  contaminant  level  [MCL]  for  such  contaminant
which  is  as  close  to  the  maximum  contaminant  level  goal  as  is  feasible."75  The
statute  defines  feasible  (not  terribly  helpfully)  to  mean  "feasible  with  the  use  of
the  best  technology,  treatment  techniques  and  other  means  which  the  [EPA]
finds  ..  . are  available.",76  Third,  the  EPA  is  required  to  undertake  a  risk
assessment  for  pollutants,  discussing  the  level  of  the  danger  and  the  costs  of
achieving  the  requisite  reduction. 7  The  risk  assessment  is  supposed  to  give  an
account,  for  the  MCL  being  considered  and  for  all  alternative  levels  being

be  available"),  7412(d)(2)  (2000)  ("achievable"),  7411(a)(1)  (2000)  ("has  been  adequately  demon-

The  risk  assessment  is  no  mere  disclosure  provision.  The  SDWA  expressly
permits-but  does  not require-the  EPA  to  set  a  MCL  at  a  level  other  than  the
feasible  level  if it  determines  that  the  benefits  of that  level  "would  not justify
the  costs  of complying  with  the  level. ' 8 2  On  the basis  of that  determination,  the
EPA  is  permitted  to  set  a  maximum  level  "that  maximizes  health  risk reduction

review  the  EPA's judgment  about  whether  the  benefits  of a  certain  level  justify
the  costs,  but  only  by  asking  whether  that  judgment  is  "arbitrary  and  capri-
CiOHS.,,84

What  does  all  this  mean?  The  SDWA  is  quite  different  from  the  Toxic
Substances  Control  Act  (TSCA),  which  expressly  requires  the  EPA  to  base
decisions  on  a  simple  comparison  of costs  and  benefits.85  The  SDWA  is  more
indirect,  even  circuitous,  in  its  endorsement  of  cost-benefit  requirements.  But
the  difference  between  the  SDWA  and  the TSCA  is  more  apparent  than real.  In
regulating  contaminants  in  drinking  water,  the  EPA is  required  to  show  that  its
judgment  about  cost-benefit  balancing  is  not  "arbitrary,"  and  this  standard  is
essentially  the  same  as applied  under the  TSCA.8 6  Perhaps  the  SDWA  gives  the
EPA  somewhat  more  room  for  the  exercise  of  discretion.  But  at  most,  the
difference  is  one  of degree.  It is  clear that  courts  are  authorized  to  invalidate  an
arbitrary  or unreasoned  assessment  on the  cost or benefit  side  or on the  question
of whether  the  benefits justify the  costs.  As  we  shall  see,  this  point raises  many
questions  for the future.

water  supply,  where  it  can  be  found  in  many  regions,  including  New  England,
eastern  Michigan,  and  the  southwestern  United States.8 8  It has  long been  known
that  arsenic  can  be  toxic, 89  even  carcinogenic, 90  and  since  1942,  the  EPA  has
had  in  place  an  arsenic  regulation  calling  for  an  MCL  of  50  ppb.91  But  in  the
past  decades,  some  evidence  has  suggested  that  arsenic  may  have  significant
adverse  effects  at levels  well below  the 50 ppb  standard.  The principal  evidence
comes  from epidemiological  studies  in Chile,  Argentina,  and  above  all Taiwan.
The evidence  from these  studies  suggests  that exposure  levels  of 300  to  600 ppb
cause  significant  increases  of various  cancers  and  other  adverse  effects.9 2  These
levels  are of course  far higher than  50 ppb;  but  if we  extrapolate  from  the  risk at
high  levels  to  what  might  well  happen  at  lower  levels,  there  could  be  serious
reason  for concern.  I  will return  to this point shortly.

In  1996,  Congress  directed  the  EPA to  propose  a  new  standard  for arsenic  by
January  1, 2000. 9  At  the  same  time,  Congress  told  the  National  Academy  of
Sciences  and  the  EPA to  study the  health  effects  of arsenic  in  order to  assist the
rulemaking  effort.94  In  1996,  the  EPA  requested  that  the  National  Research
Council  (NRC)  of  the  National  Academy  of Sciences  conduct  an  independent
review  of  arsenic  toxicity  data  and  recommend  changes  to  the  EPA's  arsenic
criteria. 95 In  its  1999  report, the NRC  located  few  studies  that examined  arsenic
effects  at  low-level  concentrations  and  even  fewer  studies  in  agreement.96  A
1995  Japanese  study  found  cancer  mortality  near  or  below  expectation  among
persons  exposed  to  arsenic  in  drinking  water  at  less  than  50  ppb.97  Domestic
research  in  the  same  year  revealed  no  association  between  bladder  cancer  risk
and  arsenic  exposure,  where  eighty-one  of eighty-eight  Utah  towns  (ninety-two
percent)  had  concentrations  below  10  ppb,  and  only  one  town  exceeded  the  50
ppb  standard.9 8  A  1999  assessment  of  Utah  mortality  rates,  which  the  EPA
described  as  "the  best  U.S.  study  currently  available," 99  found  no  increased

bladder or lung  cancer risks  after exposure  to arsenic  levels  of 14  to  166 ppb per
liter.  °°  More  recent  studies  in  Finland  and  Taiwan,  however,  linked  increased
risks  of  bladder  cancer  and  cerebrovascular  disease  to  groundwater  arsenic
consumption  as  low  as  0.1  to  50  ppb.' 0 '  The Taiwan  study, with  its  significant
population  base,  seemed especially  impressive. 0 2

These  results  could  have  led  the NRC  in  several  different  directions.  It  would  not
have  been  entirely  astonishing  for  the  NRC  to  find  that  the  evidence  was  too
inconclusive  to  support  a  new  rule.  Nonetheless,  the  NRC  concluded  that  the
Taiwan  studies  provided  the  best  available  evidence  on  human  health  effects  of
arsenic. 103  The  NRC  used  linear  extrapolations  from  these  data  to  obtain  cancer
risks  at  exposure  levels  below  50  ppb  per  liter  and  subsequently  recommended
that  the  EPA  should  significantly  lower  its  current  standard.' °4  Indeed,  the  NRC
concluded  that  "considering  the  data  on  bladder  and  lung  cancer  noted  in  the
studies  ...  a similar  approach for  all  cancers  could  easily  result in a  combined  cancer
risk  on  the  order  of 1 in  100"  from  exposure  at  50 ppb.'0 5 The  1 in  100  risk  figure
is  a special  source  of concern  because  the  EPA  is  usually  attentive  to environmental
risks at or below  1 in  1 million,' °6 and a  risk of t  in  100 seems plainly intolerable.

Critics  attacked  the  NRC's  recommendation  on  the  grounds  that  Taiwanese
cooking  and  health  practices  put  Taiwanese  citizens  at  greater  risk  for  arsenic
toxicity  than  Americans,  as  demonstrated  by  the  absence  of  a  single  report  of
U.S.  arsenic-induced  cancer.' 0 7 The  Taiwanese  population  is  much  poorer  than
the  American  population  and  suffers  from  a  number  of dietary  and  nutritional
deficiencies,  including  a higher  intake  of arsenic  from  food  and  a  deficiency  in
selenium,  zinc,  and  vitamin  B 12,  all  of which  can reduce  the toxicity  of arsenic.
Animal  studies  even  suggest  the  possibility  that  arsenic  may  be  a  nutritional
requirement,  though  there  is  insufficient  data  to  indicate  any  nutritional  role  in
human  health.' 0 8  Despite  these  criticisms,  the  EPA  relied  heavily  upon  the
NRC's  scientific  conclusions  when  redeveloping  its current MCL.

THE  ARITHMETIC  OF  ARSENIC

2271

In  2000,  the  EPA issued  a  proposed  regulation  setting  an  MCLG  of 0  ppb,  on
the  ground  that  no  safe  level  could  be  identified;  an  MCL  of  3  ppb,  on  the
ground  that  this  was  the  lowest  feasible  level;  and  a regulatory  ceiling  of 5  ppb,
on  the  ground  that  the  CBA justified  this  approach  but  not  any  more  stringent
mandate.' 0 9 The  EPA also  requested  comments  on  regulatory  ceilings  of 3,  10,
and  20  ppb,  for  which  it  provided  accounts  of  both  benefits  and  costs.  On
January  22,  2001,  the EPA issued  a  final rule  that essentially  embodied  the  same
analysis  as  the  proposal,  but with  a  crucial  change  to  a  regulatory  ceiling  of  10
ppb  rather  than  5 ppb."  0 The EPA  urged  that  its assessment of costs  and  benefits
for  the  four  different  levels  of stringency  justified  the  10 ppb  level."'  The  rule
was  to  become  effective  on March  23,  2001,  with  a compliance  date  of January
23,  2006.  12

1. Costs

The  new  regulation  would  have  required  several  thousand  water  systems-
serving  about  10  million  people-to  install  new  equipment.1 3  The overall  cost
of the  10  ppb  standard  would  have  been  about  $206  million.'  14  This  aggregate
figure  is  not  entirely  informative  because  the  additional  payments  would  vary
considerably  across  the  nation.  For  most  households,  the  annual  increase  in
water  bills  would  be  in  the  range  of  $30."  5  Water  systems  with  500  or  fewer
customers,  however,  would  face  significantly  higher  costs,  ranging  up  to  $325
per  household." 16  These  water  systems  represent  a  small  fraction  of  the  total
number  of people  affected  by  arsenic,  and  they  tend  to  involve  rural  communi-
ties.

As  it  was  required  to  do,  the  EPA  also  calculated  the  costs  of  alternative
levels  of regulation.  A  20  ppb  standard  would  cost  about  $70  million;  a  5  ppb
standard,  $470  million;  and  a  3 ppb  standard,  $790  million." 17  Here,  too,  the
disaggregated  figures  are  important. The  most  stringent  standard of 3 ppb would
cost  an  average  of $41  per affected  household,  while  the  20 ppb standard  would
cost about  an average  of $24."  8 At the  extremes,  the  20 ppb  standard  is  actually
more  expensive  ($351)  than  the 3 ppb  standard  ($317),  because  of the particular
control  technologies  that would be involved. 1 9 Consider the following  summary:

The  EPA  did  not offer  a  population-wide  breakdown  to  show  the numbers  of
people  served  by  the  various  system  sizes  and  to  examine  whether  the  people
who  would  bear  the  costs  could  do  so  easily  or  with  difficulty.  One  analysis,
admittedly  from  a  group  with  a  particular  point  of  view,  suggests  that  eighty-
seven  percent  of people  who  consume  arsenic  at  a  significant  level  in  their  tap
water  (over  1 ppb)  are  served  by  systems  serving  more  than  10,000  custom-
ers. 12'  This data suggests that  almost nine out  of ten of the people who  will  have
to  pay  for  water  technology  would  face  annual  increases  of less than  $30-not
entirely  trivial perhaps,  but certainly not  a huge  expenditure.

2.  Benefits

Within  the  EPA,  the  much  harder  issues  involved  the  benefits  of the  10  ppb
requirement.' 2 2  The  most  easily  quantified  benefits  involve  prevented  cases  of
bladder  and  lung  cancer;  here  the  epidemiological  data,  mostly  from  Taiwan,
allowed  quantitative  estimates  to  be  made.' 2 3  For  two  reasons,  however,  even
these  estimates  should  be  taken  with  some grains  of salt. The  first reason  is  that
there  are  differences  between  the  population  of Taiwan  and  that  of the  United
States.' 24  The  second  reason  is  that  a  great  deal  turns  on  the  nature  of  the

dose-response  curve.  If the  curve  is  "linear,"  meaning  that  cancer  cases  do  not
drop  sharply  at  low  exposure  levels,  many  more  cancers  will  be  predicted  than
if  the  curve  is  "sublinear,"  meaning  that  after  exposure  declines  to  a  certain
level,  the  number  of  cancer  cases  drops  off. 125  Lacking  any  data  on  the
question,  the  EPA  decided  to  assume  that  the  dose-response  curve  is  linear,
noting  that  "[t]he  use  of  a  linear  procedure  to  extrapolate  from  a  higher,
observed  data  range  to  a  lower  range  beyond  observation  is  a  science  policy
approach  that  has  been  in  use  by  Federal  agencies  for  four  decades."' 26  The
EPA  added  that  the  policy  objectives  were  "to  avoid  underestimating  risk  in
order  to  protect  public  health  and  be  consistent  and  clear  across  risk  assess-
ments."' 127  From  these  remarks,  it  seems  clear  that  the  default  assumption  of
linearity  is  not  based  on  science-which  cannot  produce  a  standard  default
assumption-but on a  policy judgment, designed to  err on  the  side of protecting
health  by  ensuring  against  underestimation  of  the  risks.  I  will  return  to  this
important  issue below. 128

Armed  with  the  assumption  of linearity, the  EPA  thought that  estimates  were
feasible  for  bladder  and  lung  cancer  and  calculated  bladder  and  lung  cancer
risks  using  the  analysis  of  the  NRC. 129  The  NRC  used  the  Taiwan  data  to
calculate  a  I  to  1.5  per  1000  lifetime  risk  of  male  fatal  bladder  cancer  at  the
current  50  ppb  standard;  it  also  examined  the  Chile  and  Argentina  studies  and
concluded  the  rates  of cancer  were  comparable  to  the  Taiwan  data.' 30  The  EPA
assessed lung cancer  risks,  which  are known  to  be two  to five  times greater than

these  are  certain  health  impacts  known  to  be  caused  by  arsenic,  though,  while
they  may be  substantial,  the  extent  to which  these  impacts occur  at levels  below
50 [ppb]  is unknown." 135

The  relevant  effects  include  several  kinds  of  cancer:  skin,  kidney,  liver,
prostate,  and  nasal  passages.' 3 6  They  also  include  pulmonary,  cardiovascular,
immunological,  neurological,  and  endocrine  effects. 137  To  these  health  effects,
the EPA added  that  there would  be other  benefits  that  would  defy quantification.
Among  these  benefits  is  "the  effect  on  those  systems  that  install  treatment
technologies  that can  address  multiple  contaminants."'' 38  Some  of the  technolo-
gies  that would  reduce  arsenic  levels  would  also  remove  "many  other contami-
nants  that [the]  EPA is in  the process of regulating  or considering  regulating."  139

c.  Converting Quantities to  Dollars.  To  compare  the  quantified  benefits  of
regulation  with  the  $206  million  cost, the EPA  was  required to  engage  in several
exercises  in  conversion.  With  respect  to  lives  saved,  the  EPA  used  a  value  of a
statistical  life  of  $6.1  million.' 40  That  figure  was  derived  by  calculating  the
average  of over two  dozen  studies,  conducted  mostly  in  the  1970s  and  generally
designed  to  show  how  much  an  employer  had  to  pay  employees  to  compensate

ties  by $6.1  million,  the  EPA  obtained  most of the  "dollar  value"  of the  arsenic
regulation. 142

As noted,  however,  many of the  cancers  caused  by  arsenic  are  not fatal.  For  a
nonfatal  cancer,  the  EPA  used  a  figure  of  $607,000.143  This  figure  does  not
come  from  measurements  of people's  willingness  to  pay  to  reduce  a  statistical
risk  of  nonfatal  cancer,  but  instead-and  somewhat  astonishingly 144-from
shoppers'  responses  to  hypothetical  questions  about  how  much  they  would  be
willing  to  pay  to  reduce  a  statistical  risk  of chronic  bronchitis. 145  Apparently,
the EPA thought that this was  the closest  available  analogue to a nonfatal  cancer.

3.  Summary  of the EPA's  Analysis

The EPA's basic  analysis is  captured  in the following  table.

The  monetized  costs  of the  10  ppb  standard  are  between  $2  million  and  $60
million  higher  than  the  monetized  benefits-and  the  overall  benefits  are  in  line
with  overall  costs  only  at  the  20  ppb  level. 147  The  EPA  was  well  aware  of this
point.  Nonetheless,  it  concluded  that  once  the  nonquantified  benefits  of the  10
ppb  standard  were  included,  the  costs  would  be  well  justified.  The  cost  per
cancer  case  avoided  for  the  final  rule  would  be  between  $3.2  million  and  $4.8

III.  PEER  REVIEW?  ARSENIC  AT  AEI-BROOKINGS

The  EPA's  conclusion  was  sharply  criticized  by  a  widely  reported  paper  from
the  AEI-Brookings  Joint  Center  for  Regulatory  Studies. 14 9  The  authors,  Jason
Burnett and  Robert  Hahn,  concluded  that  the  costs  of the  rule would  exceed  the
benefits  by  about  $190  million  each  year  and  hence  that  the  rule  deserved
membership  in  the  Joint  Center's'  "$100  million  club,"  which  includes  regula-
tions  that  cost at  least  $100  million more  than  they  promise  to  deliver. For  two
reasons,  the  Burnett-Hahn  study  is  worth  close  attention.  First,  the  AEI-
Brookings  Joint Center is  highly  respected  for its  careful  work on CBA,  and Hahn  is
an especially  able  and  influential  observer  of the  regulatory  process. 15  Second,
the disagreements  between  the  EPA and  the Joint Center  provide  a great  deal  of
information about the  nature  of CBA itself and the  likely  nature  of legal  challenges to
such  analysis  by  federal  agencies.  Burnett  and  Hahn  raised  no questions  about
the  EPA's  finding  of a  $200  million cost  to  the  arsenic  rule.  Instead,  they  made
several  key  adjustments  to  the  EPA's  calculation  of  benefits.  The  first  set  of
adjustments  involved  the  actual  number  of cancer  cases  to  be  prevented.  The
second  set involved  the  translation  of that  figure into  a dollar number.

To  calculate  cancer  cases,  Burnett  and  Hahn  made  two  changes.  First,  they
attempted  to  quantify  the  "nonquantifiable  benefits"  by  multiplying  the  EPA's
estimate  of  twenty-eight  lives  saved  by  two,  for  a  total  of  fifty-six.)5'  They
reasoned  that  "including  'nonquantifiable  risks'  would  increase  the  lives-saved
estimate  by  some  factor between  one  and  four."' 52  This  number  came  from  the
report  of  the  NRC,  which  suggests  that  the  risk  of  death  from  all  kinds  of  cancer
might  be  eight  times  the  risk  of  bladder  cancers.  Recognizing  that  the  EPA's
quantified  figure  represents  both  bladder  and  lung  cancers,  Burnett  and  Hahn
took  a  multiple  of  four  as  producing  a  "reasonable  upper  bound"  of  112;  but
they decided  to  use  the  fifty-six  estimate  because  it seemed  more reasonable. 153
Second,  Burnett  and  Hahn  divided  their chosen  number  of fifty-six  by  five to
reflect  their judgment  that  the  risk  of arsenic  is  not  linearly  related  to  arsenic
concentrations.  They  explained  that  "[t]his  assumption  is  not  realistic  because
the  human  body  can metabolize  arsenic  at  low  levels,  rendering  it nontoxic."'' 54

THE  ARITHMETIC  OF  ARSENIC

2277

(Note  that  the  EPA  concluded  that  recent  research  has  drawn  into  doubt  the
claim  that  the  metabolized  forms  of arsenic  are  any  less  toxic. 155) According  to
Burnett  and  Hahn,  the  upshot  is  that  the  new  regulation  would  save  about
eleven  lives  annually. 156

To  translate  this  amount  into  dollar  terms,  Burnett  and  Hahn  adjusted  the  $6.1
million  figure  downward.  They  emphasized  that  cancer  follows  exposure  to  arsenic
not  immediately  but  only  after  a  latency  period  ranging  from  ten  to  forty  years. 57
Burnett  and Hahn  use a  seven percent discount rate  on the theory  that  "future  benefits
5 8 As  a  result  of the  adjustment,  the
should  be  discounted  just as  future  costs  are."  1
value  of a  statistical  life  fell  to  $1.1  million.  Sharply  disagreeing  with  the  National
Research  Council's  and  the  EPA's  projected  risk  of  1 in  100,  Burnett  and  Hahn
added  that  "the  risk  reduction  is  about  1 in  1 million,  which  is  so  small  as  not  to be
worth  addressing,  given  the  uncertainties  in the  data and  the  EPA's  limited  resources
to develop  regulations."' 59  Burnett  and  Hahn  concluded  that  no plausible  version  of
the  arsenic  proposal  going beyond  the  existing  50  ppb standard  could be justified  on
cost-benefit  grounds. Here is their overview:

Burnett  and  Hahn  go  further  still.  They  urge  that  the  arsenic  regulation  is
likely  to  produce  a  net  loss  in  life  rather  than  a  gain.  The  reason  is  that
expensive  regulations  have  been  found  to have  mortality effects,  in  part because
they  make  less  money  available  for  health  care  expenditures.' 6 1  According  to
one  estimate,  a  statistical  life is  lost for every  $15  million  expenditure,  so  that  a
regulation  that  costs  $15  million  per  life  saved  results  in  no  net  mortality
reduction. 162  If  this  is  correct,  a  regulation  that  costs  $190  million  on  net  is
likely to  result  in  a  loss  of over  ten  lives,  on  balance,  every  year. This  in  fact  is
the  Burnett-Hahn  conclusion.16 3

It  is  not clear  if the  Burnett-Hahn  analysis  influenced  the  actions  of the  Bush
Administration,  but the  arsenic  rule was  delayed  shortly  after the election' 64  and
the  EPA  asked  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  to  produce  an  "expedited
review"  of the  options  between  3  ppb  and  20 ppb. At the  same  time, the Agency
sought new  studies  on both  the cost and  benefit sides. 16 5

IV.  QUESTIONS  AND  DOUBTS

Many  questions  should  be  raised  about  the  analysis  by  both  the  EPA  and
Burnett  and  Hahn.  The  first  set  of  questions  involves  the  judgment  about  the
likely benefits  in  terms  of  mortality  and  morbidity. The  second  set  involves  the
translation  of those benefits  into dollar equivalents.

My  goal  here  is  not  to  take  sides  on  the  disagreement  between  the  EPA  and
Burnett  and  Hahn.  Instead,  it  is  to  suggest  that  the  state  of  scientific  know-
ledge  at the time justified  only  benefit  ranges,  not  specific  benefit numbers. This
point  easily  might  be taken  as  a  challenge  to  CBA in  general,  and  it is  properly
so  taken  if CBA  is justified  as  a  way  of giving  specific  bottom  lines  to  resolve
hard  cases.  But if CBA  is justified  more  modestly, as  a  way  of getting a  sense  of
the  potential  consequences  of  various  courses  of  action,  nothing  I  say  here
should  be  seen  as  a  challenge  to  the  basic  method.  Indeed,  a  virtue  of  CBA  is
that  it  helps  to  explain  why  the  arsenic  question  is  hard  and  why  competing
judgments  of value  could lead  in competing  directions.  I  will  say  more  about all
this below.

THE  ARITHMETIC  OF  ARSENIC

2279

1.  The  Dose-Response  Curve  in General

A.  LIFE  AND  HEALTH  AGAIN

In  calculating  health  effects,  the  EPA  assumed  a  linear dose-response  curve
for  arsenic. 166  In  so  doing,  it  followed  its  usual practice,  which  is  to  assume  a
linear,  no-threshold  model  for  Class  A  carcinogens  in  drinking  water.  In  the
EPA's  words,  this  is  a  "conservative  mathematical  model  for cancer  risk  assess-
ment"  that  "is  consistent  with  a  no-threshold  model  of  carcinogenesis, 
i.e.,
exposure  to  even  a  very  small  amount  of the  substance  is  assumed  to  produce  a
finite  increased  risk of cancer."1 67 Note  that the  EPA's  Science  Advisory  Board,
which  consisted  of  prominent  scientists  who  issued  a  report  advising  the
Agency, also  recommended  linear extrapolation  based  upon  the  Taiwan  data. 168
But  Burnett  and  Hahn  are  correct  to  urge  that  this  was  not  an  inevitable
decision.  It  is  quite  possible  that  the  effects  of arsenic  dwindle  at  low  levels.
"There  is  no strict  rule with  respect  to the  shape  of the  dose-response  curve." 169
To  summarize  what  will  be  a  lengthy  and  somewhat  technical  discussion:  On
the  basis  of  what  is  known  about  carcinogens  generally,  the  best  scientific
judgment  seems  to  be  that  the  dose-response  curve  for arsenic  is  sublinear. But
this  is  a  speculative  judgment,  not  based  on  direct  evidence.  In  addition,  we
certainly  do not  know  how  sublinear  the  dose-response  curve  is,  if indeed  it  is
sublinear.

There  are  many  complexities  here,  for  dose-response  curves  come  in  many

shapes and  sizes:

It  has  long  been  recognized  that  a  number  of different  mathematical  models
can  fit  a given  set  of dose-response  data  reasonably  well,  but  produce  vastly
different  predictions  of risk when  extrapolated  to  doses below  the  data range.
Thus,  extrapolated  doses  corresponding  to  'de minimis' risk  levels  can  differ
by  several  orders  of  magnitude,  depending  on  the  shape  of  the dose-response
curve  at low doses.170

Often  there  is  no  evidence  about  the  relationship  between  adverse  effects  and
low  doses;  hence,  a  great  deal  of guesswork  is  involved.  An  overview  suggests
that:

a  number of models  have  been  proposed,  and  there  is  active  debate  on  which
of  these  is  most  appropriate.  One  that  is  widely  used  by  regulatory  agencies

THE  GEORGETOWN  LAW  JOURNAL

(Vol.  90:2255

because  it  is  'conservative' 
is  a  linear  no-threshold  extrapolation.  As  noted,
proof has  not  been  provided  for  any  carcinogen  that  no  threshold  exists,  and
in fact,  thresholds have  been  observed  in  many  studies,  particularly  with  weak
carcinogens.  The  assumption  of  linearity  at  low  doses  is  also  not  well
founded.  Indeed,  even  for  the  less  complicated  process  of chemical  mutagen-
esis  in  vivo,  a  drop  below  linearity  at  low  doses  has  been  demonstrated.
Therefore,  a  'hockey  stick'-shaped  curve  would  appear to  best  fit  current  data
and  concepts on  carcinogenic  mechanisms  at low  levels  of exposure.  17

There  are  five basic  possibilities. 172

a.  Supralinearity.  For some forms  of radiation,  the curve  is  actually  "supralin-
ear"  in  the  sense  that  with  lower  doses,  deaths  fall  at  relatively  lower rates  than
a  linear  curve  would  predict.' 73  If  a  dose-response  curve  is  supralinear,  of
course,  the  death  rate  will be  higher  than  if it  is  linear. Agencies  do not  assume
supralinearity,  apparently  because  it  is  an  unusual  pattern.  No  one  has  urged
supralinearity  in the  context  of arsenic.

b.  Linearity.  It  has  long  been  assumed  that  linear  curves  are  appropriate  for
"genotoxic"  carcinogens;  that  is,  carcinogens  that  work  directly  on  DNA  to
produce  mutations  that  give rise  to  tumors. 174  For  a  long  time  arsenic  has  been
assumed  not  to  be  genotoxic-a  point  that  draws  the  EPA's  assumption  of
linearity  into  some  doubt  because  sublinearity  is  the  ordinary  assumption  for
nongenotoxic  carcinogens.  But  a  recent  paper  suggests  that  arsenic  may  be
genotoxic  after  all. 175

c.  Sublinearity.  According  to  a  standard  text,  the  typical  dose-response  curve
is  "sigmoidal"  in  shape  and  thus  sublinear  at low  doses. 17 6  While  there is  some
dispute  about  the  issue,  evidence  suggests  that  this  is  the  shape  of  the  dose-

d.  Thresholds.  Sometimes  there  is  a  threshold  below  which  exposure  pro-
duces  no  adverse  effects,  as  is  apparently  the  case  for  basal  cell  carcinoma-
exposure  to  the  sun179-and 
also  for chloroform.' 80  This  is  the  extreme  case  of
sublinearity.  It  is  generally  agreed  that  thresholds  exist  "for  all  toxicities  other
than  cancer. ... Conceptually,  a  threshold  makes  sense  for  most  toxic  ef-
fects."' 8"' Government  agencies  tend  to treat  carcinogens  as  lacking  safe  thresh-
olds.  Taken  purely  as  a  scientific  judgment,  this  is  disputed:  "It  is  a  fact  that
most  of the  identified  human  carcinogens  induce  cancer  only  after  exposure  to
high  doses."'' 82

e.  U-shapes.  Some  dose-response  curves-like  the  curve  for  fluoride-
actually  show desirable  effects  at low  levels,  so that  what is  harmful  to  health  at
high  doses turns  out to  produce  beneficial  effects  at  low doses. 183  This is  true of
course  for  many  medicines,  like  aspirin,  antibiotics,  and  antihistamines.  There
appears  to  be  increasing  reason  to  believe  that  u-shapes  are common.  "In  recent
years,  the  concept  of  hormesis,  the  phenomenon  whereby  a  toxic  substance
elicits  a  beneficial  effect  at  doses  below  its  observed  range  of toxicity,  has  been
gaining  popularity  among  scientists  engaged  in  toxicology  and  risk  assess-
ment."  1

184.  See id. at  11-12. The  author's  conclusion  is worth  quoting:

For carcinogens  that  may  exhibit  U-shaped  dose-response  curves,  traditional  linear,  low-dose
extrapolation  truly  is  conservative  in  the  sense  of  public-health  protection.  However,  this
'default'  procedure  cannot  be justified  simply  on  the  basis  of either  presumed  genotoxicity  or
additivity  to  background.  If  definitive  data  on  low-dose  behavior  of  specific  carcinogens
should  indicate  U-shaped  behavior,  then  relaxing  the  default  procedure  to  accommodate
substantially  lower-than-linear  estimates  of  risk  seems  justified,  without  fear  of  seriously
underestimating  risk (EPA  1996).  However,  it will  require  strong data,  of a  nature  and  quality
not  customarily  available,  to  warrant  a  regulatory  agency's  acceptance  of  a  dose-response
relationship  that  predicts  less-than-background  risk  at  low  doses.  The  modeling  exercise
presented  here  provides  additional  support  and  encouragement  for  investigators  to  pursue  the
gathering  of biologically  definitive data  other  than  typical  tumor  incidence  data  when  horme-
sis is  strongly suggested  or  conjectured.

2.  The Dose-Response  Curve in Particular

The  possibility  of  varying  shapes  suggests  many  possible  projections  of the
health  consequences  of  exposure  to  low  doses  of arsenic.  Without  having  any
direct  evidence  for  arsenic  in  particular,  the  NRC  suggested:  "Of  the  several
modes  of action  that  are  considered  most  plausible,  a  sub-linear  dose  response
curve in  the low-dose range is predicted,  though linearity cannot be  ruled out."'  85

This  statement  should  be  taken  as  exceptionally  speculative.  It  ought  not  to
be  read  to  suggest  a  reliable  scientific  judgment  about  the  true  dose-response
curve,  for  the  NRC  offered  no  evidence  that  would justify  its  "prediction"  for
arsenic. It  appears  to  have been  generalizing  from  the  more typical  patterns.  If a
specific  judgment  is  required,  this  approach  is  as  sensible  as  any  other,  but  it  is
not  much  more  than  a  hunch.  Nonetheless,  we  can  reach  some  more  definite
conclusions.  First:  When  agencies  generally  assume  linearity,  it  is  not  because
anything  in  the  science  solidly  justifies  this  assumption,  but  because  of  a
"conservative"  approach  to  uncertain  data.186  This  is  a  policy  choice,  not  a
technical  one-a  point  with  implications  for  judicial  review,  as  we  shall  see.
Second:  Rather  than  setting  forth  a  specific  number,  it  seems  best  to  acknowl-
edge  the  uncertainty  about  the  dose-response  curve  and  hence  to  identify  a
range of benefits-capturing  a  low end  and  a high  end.

The  upshot?  For  arsenic  in  particular,  the  high  end  emerges  from  a  linear
curve  and  therefore  would  be  twenty-eight  lives  saved  annually.  The  low  end is
six  lives  saved  annually,  which  is  what  emerges  from  dividing  that  number  by
five.  That  division  is  essentially  arbitrary,  so  we  should  not  credit  the  Burnett-
Hahn  suggestion  that it is likely to be  accurate.

3.  Nonquantified  Benefits

What  about  the  nonquantified  benefits?  Here  it  would be certainly  responsible
to  say,  as  did  the  EPA,  that  the  data  do  not  allow  numerical  judgments  of any
kind. But  it  would  also be  responsible  to  attempt  to  specify  an upper  and  lower
bound.  Burnett  and  Hahn  estimate  the  "nonquantified"  benefits  by  multiplying
the EPA's  expected  lives  saved by  two. 187  But  this  seems arbitrary.  As they note,
the  National  Research  Council  estimated  the risk  of all  types  of cancer  as  eight
times  greater  than  the  risk from  bladder cancer  alone.  Because  the EPA's  figure
of twenty-eight  lives  saved  came  from  both  bladder  and  lung  cancer,  it  would
have  been  sensible  to  posit  an  upper  bound  of  112  (arrived  at  by  multiplying
twenty-eight  by  four).  The  multiplier  of  four  is  reasonable  because  the  NRC
suggested  a  risk  eight  times  as  high  as  the  risk  from bladder  cancer,  which  is  to

evidence that linearity  is  a scientifically  plausible  assumption).

say  approximately  four  times  the  risk  from  bladder  cancer  and  lung  cancer.  If
the  lower  bound  of  lives  saved  (from  the  analysis  of  possible  sublinearity)  is
six,  the lower bound,  from that  assumption, would  be  twenty-four.

4.  Problems  in Taiwan

I  have  suggested  that  there  are  many  reasons  to  question  the Taiwan  data,
which  involved  a  poorer  population  with  a  worse  diet,  at  risk  of  arsenic
exposure  from  multiple  sources  other  than  drinking  water.  Another  criticism
of  the  Taiwan  data  is  that  it  measures  arsenic  exposure  by  overall  exposure
to  village  wells  and  not  individual  exposure.' 88  There  is  an  additional
problem.  Wells  within each  village  had  varying  arsenic  levels  (so  that  people
using  certain  wells  had  much  higher  exposures  than  others  in  the  same
village),  but  not  all  village  wells  were  measured,  and  villagers  were  as-
signed  a  single  median  concentration  (the  data  also  did  not  account  for
villagers  who  moved  because  it  assumed  a  lifetime  exposure  to  the  levels  of
a  subject's  present  village).' 89  Thus  the  principal  data  on  which  the  EPA
relied  did  not  allow  precise  extrapolations.  The  NRC  explicitly  acknowl-
edged  this  point:  "Some  factors,  such  as  poor  nutrition  and  arsenic  intake
from  food,  might  affect  assessment  of  risk  in  Taiwan  or  extrapolation  of
results in  the  United  States."' 90

On  the  basis  of the  EPA's  data  and  with  reasonable  assumptions,' 9 '  the  best
conclusion  is  that  the  number  of  lives  saved  by  the  regulation  would  range
between  6  and  112.  To  say  the  least,  that  is  an  exceedingly  wide  range.  If  the
regulation  were  expected  to  cost  $6  million,  it  would  seem  reasonable  to
proceed;  almost  no  one  denies  that  a  cost  per  life  saved  of  $1  million  is
worthwhile.  If the  regulation  were  expected  to  cost  $10  billion,  it  would  seem
reasonable  not to  proceed.  But  what if the  cost  fell  between  $6  million  and  $10
billion?  What  if  the  cost  were  about  $200  million,  as  the  EPA  estimated?  To
make  progress  on  that  question,  it  is  necessary  to  discuss  the  question  of
monetization.

B.  MONETIZING

With  respect  to  money,  the  principal  disagreement  between  the  EPA  and
Burnett  and  Hahn  involves  the appropriate  discount rate.  For  the  moment, let  us
put  that issue  to one  side;  I  will  return  to  it shortly. As  the  EPA acknowledges  in
its  "sensitivity  analysis,"  there  are  good  reasons  to  adjust the  EPA's  monetized
estimate  upwards  rather than  downwards.

1.  Arsenic  Versus  the Workplace

As  I  have  noted,  the  EPA's  $6.1  million  figure  comes  from  workplace  risks
not involving  cancer  and  generally  involving  dangers  to  which  workers  expose
themselves  voluntarily-in  the  sense  that  they  receive  compensation  in  return.
In  fact  many  questions  might be  raised  about the  workplace  risk  studies. 192  One
problem  is  the  sheer  variety  of the  number  in  those  studies,  ranging  from  $0.7
million to  $16.3  million  in  1997  dollars.  Consider  the following  table:

This  wide  range  of the  outcomes  raises  questions  about  the  reliability  of the
$6.1  million  figure.  The  EPA  updated  the  relevant  numbers  for  inflation,  but  it
did  not  otherwise  make  adjustments.  On  reasonable  assumptions,  the  EPA
appears  to  have  produced  a  significant  undervaluation  of the  monetary  value  of
the  lives at  stake.  Consider  the following  points.

a.  Income  Growth.  The  EPA  acknowledged  that  the  $6.1  million  figure  re-
flects  no  adjustment  to  account  for  changes  in  national  real  income  growth.  In
principle,  the  failure  to  undertake  an  adjustment  seems  to  be  a  serious  mistake.

THE ARITHMETIC  OF  ARSENIC

2285

Of course  people  with  more  money would  be willing to  pay  more, other  things  being
equal,  to  reduce  statistical  risks.  As  the  EPA also  noted  in  its  sensitivity  analysis,  the
appropriate adjustment  would  increase  the VSL from  $6.1  million to $6.7  million. 94

b.  Distinctive Risks.  The  risk  of  cancer  from  drinking  water  is  qualitatively
different  from  the  workplace  risks  that  the  EPA  used  to  generate  its  VSL.  The
risks  from  drinking  water  seem  peculiarly  involuntary  and  uncontrollable,  and  a
great  deal  of literature  suggests  that  involuntary  and  uncontrollable  risks  pro-
duce  greater  individual  concern. 195  It  is  important  not  to  think  that  there  is  a
rigid  dichotomy  between  the  involuntary-uncontrollable  and  the  voluntary-
controllable. 196  This  is  a  continuum  without  sharp  divisions  among  various
points.  The  underlying  issues  seem  to  be  whether  those exposed  to  the  risk  are
exposed  knowingly  and  whether  it  is  costly  or  otherwise  difficult  for  people  to
avoid  the risk. As  compared  to  workplace  risks,  there can be  little doubt  that the
risk of arsenic  from  drinking  water  is  worse  along  the  relevant  dimensions.  For
this  reason,  it  makes  sense  to  think  that  people  would  be  willing  to  pay  a
premium  to  avoid the risks  associated with  arsenic.

There  are  some  related  points.  People  seem  to  have  a  special  fear  of cancer,
and  they  seem  to  be willing  to  pay  more  to  prevent  a  cancer  death  than  either  a
sudden  unanticipated  death  or  a  death  from  heart  disease. 197  The  cancer  "pre-
mium"  might  be  produced  by  the  dreaded  nature  of  cancer;  it  seems  well-
established  that  some  risks  are  particularly  dreaded  and  that  dreaded  risks
produce  special  social  concern,  holding  the  statistical  risk  constant.  Some
studies  suggest  that  people  are  willing  to  pay  twice  as  much  to  prevent a  cancer
death  as  an instantaneous  death. 198

The  EPA  was  alert  to  these  points.  Its  own  sensitivity  analysis  suggests  the
need  for  an  upwards  revision  of seven  percent  because  of the  involuntariness
and  uncontrollability  of  the  risk.' 99  With  this  revision  and  the  revision  for
income  growth,  the value  of a  statistical  life  would rise  to  about  $7.2  million.2 ° °
In  fact  there  are  reasons  to  believe  that  this  might  be  far  too  low.  One  study
suggests  that  "the  value  of avoiding  a  death  from  an  involuntary,  carcinogenic
risk  should  be  estimated  as  four  times  as  large  as  the  value  of  avoiding  an
instantaneous  workplace  fatality."'20 1  If  we  take  this  approach,  the  value  jumps
from $6.7  million  to $26.8  million.

THE  GEORGETOWN  LAW  JOURNAL

[Vol.  90:2255

c.  One  More Wealth  Effect.  There  is  a  final  point.  The  studies  that  produced
the  $6.1  million  figure  involved  the  workplace,  and  the  people  involved  were
poorer  than  most  workers.  Because  the  median  salary  of  all  wage  earners  is
twenty-three  percent  higher than the  median  salary  of most workers  involved  in
the  willingness-to-pay  studies,  a  further adjustment  seems  appropriate,  produc-
ing a VSL of $33  million.

Now  it  would  be  foolish  to  claim  that  this  figure  has  a  unique  claim  to
accuracy.  But  with  different  assumptions,  none  of them  entirely  implausible,
the  value  of a  statistical  life at  risk  from  arsenic  can  range  from  $1.1  million
to  $33  million-and  the  number  of  lives  saved  from  6  to  112.  In  terms  of
dollars,  that  produces  a  lower  bound  of  $6.6  million,  and  an  upper bound  of
$3.7  billion!

d.  Life-Years  as  Opposed  to  Lives.  Would  the  arsenic  rule  protect  young
people  or old  people?  The  question  seems  to  matter  because,  in  principle,  it is
better  for  the  government  to  devote  resources  toward  saving  many  years  rather
than  simply a  few. 20 2 If the  government  can  prevent  a  death  at seventy-five  that
would  otherwise  occur  at  eighty,  surely  it  should  attempt  to  do  so;  but  if
resources  are  limited,  the  government  would  do  better  to  prevent  a  death  at
twenty  that  would  otherwise  occur  at  eighty.  The  point  seems  to  matter  here
because  it  appears  that  the  arsenic  rule  would  protect  mostly  older  people,  not
younger  ones.  If this  is  right,  it  is  because  of the  long  latency  period.  Because
arsenic-induced  cancer  does  not occur  until  decades  after exposure,  the average
age  of the  victims  of arsenic-induced  cancer  would  be  relatively  high,  possibly
above  retirement  age.20 3  Nonetheless,  the  EPA  treated  each  life  involved  as
worth  $6.1  million.  This number  might  well  be  inflated.

e.  Nonfatal Cancers.  As  we  have  seen,  the  EPA  valued  a  nonfatal  cancer  at
$607,000  based  on  shopping  mall  studies  involving  answers  to  hypothetical
questions  with  respect  to  chronic  bronchitis.  There  are  obviously  many  prob-
lems  with  this  approach;  chronic  bronchitis  simply is  not nonfatal  cancer. In  fact
another  study  (also  with  serious  methodological  problems)  produced  a  $3.6
million  figure  for  nonfatal  cancers. 2
4  This  amount  seems  quite  odd  because  it
0
suggests  that  preventing  a  nonfatal  cancer  is valued  at well  over  fifty percent of
the  value  of preventing  a  fatal  cancer  ($6.1  million  using  the  EPA's  estimate).
But  suppose  that  this  number  is  taken  to  be  accurate  or  a  reasonable  upper
bound.  If so,  the  monetized  value  of reductions  in nonfatal  cancers  from  the  10

ppb  standard  rises  in  value  to  about  $93.6  million-a  sizeable  jump  over  the
$15  million  produced  by the  $607,000  figure.

2.  Discounting

It  does  seem  sensible  to  say  that  a  discount  rate  should  be  applied  to  latent
harms.  A cancer  thirty  years  from  now  is  not  as  bad  as  a  cancer  tomorrow.  Note
that  this  point  does  not  take  a  stand  on  the  controversial  question  of  whether
harms  to future  generations  should be discounted. 0 5  The  only  suggestion  is  that
people  today  would  be  willing  to  pay  less to  prevent  a  cancer  in  decades  than  a
cancer  in  weeks.  Now  it  would  be  possible  to  suggest  that  arsenic  regulation  is
designed to  prevent  risks,  not actual  harms,  and  that  the risks,  unlike  the  harms,
will  occur  immediately.  The  suggestion  is  correct,  but  it  is  not  responsive.
People  would  pay  more  to  prevent  a  risk  of harm  in  a  month  than  a  risk  of  a
harm  in  two decades,  and that claim  is  sufficient to justify  discounting  here.

But  to  make  an  assessment,  it  is  not  enough  to  decide  to  discount.  We  also
have  to  decide  (a)  the  appropriate  discount  rate  and  (b)  the  latency  period.
Burnett  and  Hahn choose  a  seven  percent  figure, which  comes  from  the discount
rate  for  money. 20 6  But  it  is  not  obvious  that  the  same  discount  rate  is  sensible
for  latent  harms  as  for  money, and  there  is  some reason  to  think  the  opposite.  If
the  seven  percent  figure  is  correct  for  money,  there  are  two  reasons.  First,
money  can  be  invested  and  will  grow,  and  because  of that  simple  fact  a  dollar
today  is  worth  more  than  a  dollar  in  a  year. Second,  people  have  a  "pure"  time
preference  for  current  income.  Even  apart  from  investment  value,  it  would  be
better to  have  money  soon.  If willingness  to  pay  is  to  govern  the  discount  rate,
then  the  calculation  of that  rate  for  money  should  be  a  function  of  these  two
points.  To  be  sure,  government  selection  of  the  discount  rate  is  usually  a
simplified  version  of this analysis and depends on  the investment  value of money.

Note,  however,  that  the  analysis  is  not  the  same  for  risks  of harm.  It  is  not
possible  to "invest"  good  health,  at least not in the  same way  as  dollars.  If one is
going  to  get  cancer  in  any  event,  a  cancer-free  year  cannot  be  used  to  produce
more  of the  same.  To  be  sure,  most  people  would  rather  get  cancer  thirty  years
hence  than  ten  years  hence-perhaps  to  ensure  more  life-years  or  perhaps
because  of a  pure time  preference.  And  indeed,  it  would be desirable  to  shift the
analysis  from  lives  to  life-years.  But  there  is  no  reason  to  think  that  the  time
preference  for  health  is  identical  to  the  time  preference  for  money.  There  are
many  uncertainties  here.  Some evidence  supports  a  discount  rate  of two  to  three
percent, 2° 7  which  would  result,  not in  a  figure  of $1.1  million per  life  saved,  but
a  figure  closer  to  $4.5  million.  My  principal  points  are  that  no  evidence  shows

that  future  health  benefits  should  be  discounted  at  the  same  rate  as  future
monetary  costs-and, more  speculatively,  that  there  is  good reason  to think  that
the  discount  rate  for  health  benefits  should  be  lower  than  the  discount  rate  for
monetary  costs.

What  of  the  latency  period?  Hahn  and  Burnett  chose  thirty  years,  but  this
time  period  seems  both  long  and  somewhat  arbitrary.  If  the  latency  period  is
chosen  to  be  twenty  years  rather  than  thirty,  the  value  per  life  saved  increases
still further, approaching  $5 million.

One final  point on  this table.  It might  be suggested  that  some  effort  should be
made  to  identify  a  "best estimate"  and  that  analysis  would  be  greatly  improved
by  trying  to  assign  probabilities  to  the  various  outcomes,  with  the  "best  esti-

208.  This  number  was  calculated  by  multiplying  112 by  $33  million,  obtaining  $3.7  billion,  and  then
adding  $3.6  million  (the  highest  reasonable  upper  bound  for  nonfatal  cancers)  multiplied  by  26,
producing  $93.6  million,  for the  total of $3.794  billion.

209.  This  number  was  calculated  by  multiplying  112  by  $6.7  million,  obtaining  $750  million,  and
then  adding  $1.5  million  (a  more  reasonable  upper  bound  for  nonfatal  cancers)  multiplied  by  26,
producing  $39  million,  for the  total  of $789  million.

210.  This  figure  cannot  be  calculated  because  there  is  no  estimate  of lives  saved.  To  calculate  this
figure,  one  would  multiply  lives  saved  by  about  $4.5  million  (to  accommodate  both  cancer  premium
and  latency  period),  multiply  nonfatal  cancers  prevented  by  about $1.5  million  or  more,  and  add  those
two figures  together.

mate"  consisting  of  the  most  probable  one.  The  goal  of  this  suggestion  is
correct.  When  the  underlying  science  and  economics  allow  analysts  to  come  up
with  a  "best  estimate"  and  to  assign  probabilities  to  the  alternative  outcomes,
this  indeed should  be  done. In  terms of monetizing  the relevant  values,  it  seems
correct  to say  that  the cancer  risk deserves  a  premium  as compared  to  workplace
risks,  but  also  to  insist  on  discounting  the  monetary  value  of  the  risk  to  take
account  of  the  latency  period  and  the  fewer  life-years  saved.  Hence,  rough
estimates  of  $4.5  million  per  life  saved  and  $1.5  million  per  nonfatal  cancer
prevented  seem  as  reasonable  as  anything  else,  even  if somewhat  arbitrary.  At
the  very  least,  the EPA's  $6.1  million  figure  appears  too  high  in  light of the long
latency  period,  and  the  AEI-Brookings  $1.1  million  figure  appears  too  low  in
light  of the  high  discount  rate  that  it  reflects  and  the  various  factors  suggesting
that  the  workplace  studies  understate  the  monetary  value  of  the  risk  involved
here.

But  with  respect  to  health  benefits,  science  does  not  allow  best  estimates  to
be  provided  here.  It  would  be  reasonable  to  suggest  that  the  high  estimate  of
112  lives  saved  is  unrealistically  high  and  a  bit of a  scare  tactic  in  light of  the
problems  in  the Taiwan  data  and  the  probability  that  the dose-response  curve  is
sublinear.  The  estimate  of  zero  lives  saved  is  highly  improbable.  But  it  does
seem  to  me  sensible  to  move  toward  concern  with  life-years  saved  rather  than
lives  saved,  and  because  of the  long  latency  period,  the  quantified  benefits  are
most  unlikely  to  be  enormously  higher  than  the  $210  million  price  tag.2 '  On
the  other hand,  they  might well  be  higher  whether  or not  they  are  much  higher,
and  for  reasons  to  be  elaborated  shortly,  the "bottom  line"  numbers  need  not  be
dispositive.

C.  LESSONS

Does  all  this  suggest  that  CBA  is,  in  cases  of this  sort,  unhelpful?  It  would
not  be  hard  to  imagine  an  affirmative  answer  to  that  question.  A  skeptic  might
conclude  that  because  the  range  of uncertainty  is  so  large,  any  number  at  all
could  be justified  and  the  ultimate  decision  is  essentially  political  or  based  on
"values."  This  view  is  not  exactly  wrong,  but  it  should  not  be  taken  as  a
convincing  challenge  to  CBA.

An  analysis  of benefits  and  costs  cannot  resolve  the  ultimate judgment,  but it
can  certainly  inform  it.  Once  we  understand  the  potential  effects  of  different
arsenic  regulations  and  see  where  the  uncertainties  come  from,  we  are  in  a
much better  position  to know  what to do. Of course  a  decision  on that count will
be  a  product  of  "values"-how  could  it  be  otherwise?  The  point  is  that  the
values  should  be  identified  as  such,  so  that  when  the  government  acts,  its

211.  This judgment  is  based  on  the  information  before  the  EPA when  it initially  decided to  issue  the
new  regulation.  New  data  suggest  that  the  monetized  benefits  may  indeed  be  much  higher  than  the
monetized  costs. See  SUBCOMM.  ON ARSENIC  IN  DRINKING  WATER,  supra  note  13,  at  4.

THE GEORGETOWN  LAW  JOURNAL

(Vol.  90:2255

reasons  are transparent  and  explicable.  If what I have  said thus  far is  correct,  the
choice  of a  new  arsenic  rule  was  a  genuinely  hard  question  on  the  data  before
the  EPA  in  2000.  Under  the  best  case  scenario,  the  benefits  will  exceed  the
costs,  though  perhaps  not  by  a  great  deal.  Under  the  worst  case  scenario,  the
costs  will exceed  the  benefits.  It  is  a  tribute  to CBA  that  we  know  exactly  why
the  ultimate judgment  is hard.

V.  CBA IN  COURT

We  are  now  in  a  position  to  see  the  multiple  possible  challenges  to  any
agency  decision,  that  involves  cost-benefit  balancing.  Because  such  balancing
has  become  a  staple  of regulatory  practice,  it  is  important  for  lawyers  to  have
some  understanding  of the  underlying  ideas  and  of how  agencies  might be  said
to  have  gone  wrong. There  are  lessons  for courts  as  well,  mostly  involving  the
need  for deference  to  agencies.

A.  LAWYERS:  HOW  TO  MAKE  BENEFITS  GO  WAY  UP OR  WAY  DOWN

With  respect  to  the  regulation  of social  risks, the  legal culture  is  increasingly
required  to  pay  close attention  to  both  science  and economics, 21 2 and  here  legal
understandings  remain  in  a  primitive  state.  If we  keep  in  mind  the  arithmetic  of
arsenic,  we can  see how creative  lawyers  representing  water systems  or environ-
mentalists  might  be  able  to  mount  plausible  challenges  to  the  EPA's  decisions
regardless  (almost)  of  the  content  of those  decisions.  I  do  not  mean  to  endorse
these  challenges,  but  simply  to  give  a  sense  of what  they  might  look  like.  The
following  list catalogues  the  potential  challenges.

1. The  Dose Response  Curve

A  great  deal  depends  on  the  dose-response  curve,  and  at  low  levels  the
scientific  evidence  will  often  be  inconclusive.  With  the  assumption  of a  linear
curve,  the  benefits  of regulation  will  seem  far higher  than  they  might  otherwise
be.  But from  the  scientific  point  of view,  that  assumption  might  be  vulnerable.
In the  case  of arsenic,  the  most striking  point  is  that the  independent  entities  on
which  the  EPA  relies  actually  split  on  the  issue,  with  the  Scientific  Advisory
Board  supporting  linearity and  the  National  Research  Council  tentatively  favor-
ing  sublinearity.  In  addition,  linearity  makes  more  sense  for genotoxic  carcino-
gens,  and  there  is  a  dispute  about  whether  arsenic  is  genotoxic.  A  decision  to
assume  linearity,  in  the  face  of  scientific  uncertainty,  is  best  seen  as  a  (reason-
able)  policy judgment.  Under a  statute  that  calls  for a  "margin  of safety,"  such  a
judgment  is  plainly  supportable.  It  may  be  that  an  agency  can  indulge  such  a

212.  See,  e.g.,  Am. Trucking Ass'ns  v.  EPA,  175  F.3d  1027  (D.C.  Cir.  1999)  (discussing  the  scientific
and  economic  issues  involved  in  regulating  particulates  and  ozone),  rev'd, Whitman  v.  Am. Trucking
Ass'ns,  531  U.S.  457  (2001);  Corrosion  Proof  Fittings  v.  EPA,  947  F.2d  1201  (5th  Cir.  1991)
(discussing the economic  costs  and  scientific  evidence  relating  to asbestos  regulation).

THE  ARITHMETIC  OF ARSENIC

2291

judgment under  a statute  that calls  for cost-benefit  balancing,  but certainly  not if
science  clearly  points  in  the  other  direction. 2 13  For  a  lawyer  objecting  to
regulation  that  seems  too  stringent,  the  best  claim  is  that  sublinearity  is  more
likely. 2 14  For  a  lawyer  objecting  to  regulation  that  seems  inadequate,  the  best
claim  is  that  in  the  absence  of  specific  data,  linearity  is  the  standard  default
assumption  on  policy  grounds.  As  a  legal  matter,  the  EPA  is  probably  on  solid
ground  in  relying  on  the  linearity  assumptions  if  the  scientific  evidence  is
unclear.

2.  Inadequate  Evidence

When  regulating  a  pollutant,  the  EPA  will  often  have  to  rely  on  evidence
from  other  times  and  areas,  and  it  will be easy  to  suggest that  there  are  relevant
differences  between  the  population  at  issue  and  the  population  from  which  that
evidence  derives.  In  the  case  of  arsenic,  the  Taiwan  data  could  certainly  be
challenged  as inadequate  in  light  of the  absence  of data  from  the  United  States
confirming the  basic results.

3.  Valuation  Problems

If cancer  risks  are  involved,  the agency's  decision  to  use  its ordinary  VSL can
be  challenged  on  the  ground  that  good  evidence  shows  a  higher  VSL  for  risks
that  are  dreaded  and  uncontrollable  (as  cancer  risks  are  likely  to  be).  Lawyers
objecting  to  insufficiently  aggressive  regulation  could  use  this  evidence  to
suggest  that  the  VSL  numbers  from  workplace  studies  are  simply  too  low.
Lawyers  objecting  to  overaggressive  regulation  could  insist  that  the  only  reli-
able  data  come  from  the  workplace  studies  and  that  any  efforts  to  produce
higher numbers  are too  speculative.21 5

4.  Poor Morbidity Data

Agencies  frequently  lack  good  data  on  morbidity  risks  and  therefore  use
crude  substitutes.  These  are  easily  subject  to  challenge.  In  the  arsenic  case,  an
environmental  lawyer could  urge  that the chronic  bronchitis  numbers  are  far too
low because  a  case  of cancer  is  very likely  to produce  higher  willingness  to pay
than  a  case  of chronic  bronchitis.2 16  For  their  part,  industry  lawyers  could  urge
that  chronic  bronchitis  is  comparable  or perhaps  even  worse,  simply  because  it
is  chronic.  Perhaps  a  case  of  cured  cancer,  even  if it  is  entirely  cured,  is  not
much  more  serious  than  a  case  of  any  other  curable  disease,  and  perhaps  a

213.  For a  holding  to  this  effect,  see  Chlorine  Chemistry  Council  v. EPA  206 F.3d  1286,  1291  (D.C.
Cir.  2000)  (ruling  that  EPA  acted  arbitrarily  and  capriciously  in  overriding  scientific  evidence  that
chloroform  is a  threshold  pollutant  under the  SDWA).

[Vol.  90:2255

serious  chronic  condition  such  as  chronic  bronchitis  is  more  serious  than  a
cured  cancer.  In  either  case,  it  would  be  easy  to  challenge  the  actual  numbers
used  for  chronic  bronchitis  as  unreliable,  because  they  were  generated  through
responses  by  shoppers  in  North  Carolina  to  hypothetical  questions.  Even  if
well-designed,  that  study  is  not likely to produce  reliable  numbers.

5.  Lives  vs.  Life-Years

If an agency  uses  lives  rather  than life-years,  there  may  be a  serious  problem,
at  least  if  the  regulation  would  protect  a  large  number  of  children  or  elderly
people.  For  protection  of children,  the  $6.1  million  figure  is  arguably  far  too
low;  for  protection  of  elderly  people,  that  same  figure  is  arguably  far  too
high.2 17

6.  Inadequate  Quantification  of Benefits

For  a  lawyer  on  either  side,  it  is  not  hard  to  argue  that unquantified  benefits
should be quantified,  if this  is  at all  possible.2 18 Without  quantification,  how can
agency  decisions  be evaluated?  And once  a  decision  is  made  to quantify  benefits
that  had  formerly  been  unquantified,  agency judgments  are  subject  to  challenge
because  the judgment  about  how  to  quantify  will  be  highly  speculative.  If the
agency  has  not  specified  a  range  but has  relied  on a  fairly  specific  projection,  it
will be  extremely  vulnerable.

7.  Choice of Discount  Rate

The  level  of  monetized  benefits  will  differ  dramatically  with  the  chosen
discount  rate.  It  would  be  easy  to  challenge  any  agency's  decision  not  to
discount a  risk  that  will come  to fruition  in  the  future. A  monetary  loss or  a loss
to  health  is  worse  today  than  years  hence.  Once  the  agency  has  chosen  to
discount,  any  particular  discount  rate  might  well  be  challenged.  Economists
disagree  about  the  proper  approach.  If the  agency  chooses  a  discount  rate  for
health  in  the  vicinity  of  the  discount  rate  for  money-that  is,  seven  to  ten
percent-its  choice  might  well  be  challenged  on  the  ground  that  no  good
evidence  supports the  view  that health problems  averted should  be discounted  at
the  same  rate  as  financial  losses  averted.  But  if the  agency  chooses  a  discount
rate  below  seven  percent,  it  would  not  be  hard  to  challenge  that  choice  as
essentially  arbitrary  and  unsupported  by evidence.

B.  AGAINST  SCIENCE  COURTS

Notwithstanding  the  availability  of  countless  legal  challenges,  the  basic
lesson  for courts  is  simple:  Hands  off. When  courts  are  reviewing  an  agency's

217.  It is  not  clear, however,  how to think  about  willingness  to pay  in  this  context. Older  people  tend
to  be wealthier,  and  they might  well be  willing  to pay  large  amounts to  protect  relatively  few  life  years.

THE  ARITHMETIC  OF  ARSENIC

2293

judgments  about  health  benefits  and  how  to  monetize  them,  they  should  give
agencies  the  benefit  of every  reasonable  doubt.

The  reasons  are  threefold.  First,  the  issues  are  exceedingly  complex,  and
judges  are  not  specialists  in the  area  at hand. Like  everyone  else,  they  are  prone
to  error.  There  is  no  systematic  reason  to  think  that  a  firm  judicial  hand  will
make  things  better  rather  than  worse.  Second,  any  judicial  judgment  will
perpetuate  the  status  quo  and  make  rulemaking  more  difficult. 2' 9  Because  it  is
extremely  time  consuming  to  make  rules  and  because  a  clever  advocate  likely
will  be  able  to  produce  a  plausible  challenge  to  whatever  an  agency  does,  an
aggressive  judicial  posture  will  essentially  freeze  whatever  rule  is  currently  in
place.  In many  domains,  people  have  expressed  concern  with  the "ossification"
of rulemaking. 220  When  a  statute  calls  for cost-benefit  balancing,  any  nondefer-
ential judicial  posture  will  magnify  the  risk  of ossification.  Third,  many  of the
underlying  decisions  involve  values,  not  facts.  We  have  seen  that  often  the
choice  between  a  linear  and  sublinear  dose-response  curve  cannot  be  based  on
direct  evidence.  Any  choice  has  a  large  policymaking  dimension.  "[T]here  is
wide  recognition  among  experts-but  not  necessarily  in  the  public  opinion-
that  current  approaches  to  the  regulation  of most  agents  remain judgmental."2 2'
In this  light, courts  should  be reluctant  to  displace  the judgments  of administra-
tors, who  have  advantages  both  as  technocrats  and public  representatives.

This  does  not  mean  that  agencies  should  be  permitted  to  do  whatever  they
want. We  can easily  imagine  genuinely  arbitrary  decisions.2 22  But so  long  as  the
agency  has  not  done  something  truly  unreasonable,  its  efforts  to  quantify  and
monetize health benefits  should be  held acceptable.

VI.  POLICY  ANALYSTS:  WHAT  SHOULD  BE  DONE?

A.  NO  OBVIOUSLY  BEST  CHOICE

1. Puzzles

On  the  analysis  thus  far,  it  should  be  clear  that  there  was  no  obviously  best
choice  for the  EPA.  Of the  options  considered,  the  most dramatic  would  be  the
two  poles:  to  retain  the  existing  50  ppb  standard  or  to  select  the  3  ppb
standard-which  the EPA deemed  feasible.  Neither  of these  choices  would  have
been  ludicrous,  and  neither  should be  seen  as violative  of the  SDWA.  Notwith-
standing  the  NRC  report,  it  would  not be  entirely  irrational  to  conclude  that  the
existing  data-most  of it  from  Taiwan-simply  does  not justify  further  restric-

tions, especially  in light of studies suggesting  no adverse  effects  from low  levels
of arsenic  in  drinking  water.  And  notwithstanding  the  AEI-Brookings  study,  it
would  not be  impossible to  produce  numbers  suggesting  that  the  3 ppb  standard
might  well  be  justified,  at  least  if  the  nonquantified  benefits  are  taken  into
account and  pegged  at the  higher points  in  the range.

2.  Tiebreakers

Could  it  be  possible  to  resolve  the  controversy  through  some  general,  back-
ground  considerations?  When  individuals  and  governments  are  not sure what  to
do, they  often  invoke  "second-order"  principles  designed  to  simplify the  inquiry
in the  event of difficulty.223  There  are  several  possibilities  here.

One  solution  would  be  to  invoke  the  "precautionary  principle,"  which  says
that reasonable  doubts  should  be  resolved  in  favor  of protecting  safety,  health,
and  the  environment. 224  The  precautionary  principle  has  had  a  significant
influence  on  both  national  and  international  environmental  policy.22 5  It  also
seems  to  track  private  behavior. People  purchase  smoke  alarms  and  insurance;
perhaps  regulation  of arsenic  can  be  seen  as  analogous.  In the  face  of scientific
uncertainty,  why  not  make  an  expenditure  that  might  well  turn  out  to  avert
serious  harm?2 26  In a catchphrase:  Better safe than  sorry.227

If this point is meant to  suggest  that  significant  investments  are worthwhile  to
prevent  speculative  harms,  it  is  certainly  correct.  But everything  depends  on  the
size  of the  investment  and  the  speculative  nature  of the  harm.  Taken  seriously,
one  problem  with  the  precautionary  principle  is  that  it  would  lead  to  huge
expenditures,  exhausting  the  relevant  budget  before  the  menu  of options  could
be  thoroughly  consulted.  Indeed,  the  precautionary  principle  would  lead  to
paralysis  because  there  are  risks  on  all  sides  of  the  equation.22 8  Recall  that
many  households  would  be  required  to  spend  more  than  $300  per  year  for
water;  EPA  Administrator  Whitman  has  expressed  a  concern  that  the  increased
expenditure  will  lead many  people to  use  small,  local  wells,  which  have  heavily

polluted  water.22 9  In  these  circumstances,  the  precautionary  principle  suggests
that  new arsenic  regulation  is  undesirable  because  it  might sacrifice  lives. Recall
too  that  expensive  regulations  can  have  adverse  effects  on  life  and  health  and
hence  that  the  $210  million  expenditure  for  arsenic  regulation  has,  as  a  worst
case  scenario,  significant  adverse  health  effects,  with  perhaps  as  many  as  thirty
to  forty  lives  lost. 230  If  this  is  so,  the  precautionary  principle  seems  to  argue
against new  regulation.  It  seems  clear  that precaution,  by itself, can  be  taken  to
argue  for  no  regulation,  much  regulation,  and  every  point  in  between.  On
reflection,  the  idea is  insufficiently  helpful.2 3'

Perhaps  a  more  refined  argument  is  better.  For  most  of  the  country,  the
incremental  cost  of the  arsenic  regulation  is  low-less  than  $30  per  year. If the
vast  majority of people  would  receive  additional  protection  at a  cost that is  high
in  the  aggregate  ($210  million,  for  example)  but  extremely  low  for  each
affected  family,  shouldn't  government  proceed  with  regulation,  perhaps  with
exemptions  or subsidies  for those  who  would  have  to  pay  more? The  argument
is  not  implausible,  but  it proves  too  much.  In  many  cases,  it would  be  possible
to  do  some  good  by  asking  everyone  to  pay,  say,  $2  per  year.  Should  the  EPA
ask  every  American  to  pay  $2  year,  so  as  to  create  a  $500  million  fund  to  be
used  to  pay  for  additional  reductions  in  sulfur  dioxide  emissions?  Carbon
monoxide  emissions?  Benzene  emissions?  Clean-up  of lead paint? Anti-tobacco
advertising?  Childhood  immunizations?  Relief  of poverty?  Because  the  list  of
possibilities  is  endless,  it  is  unhelpful  to  treat  small  per-family  costs  as  if they
were  zero  or  its  moral  equivalent;  we  do  better  to  ensure  that  those  funds  are
used  for purposes  that  would  do  more  good  than  harm  or for  the  most  possible
good.  This  does  not  mean  that  a  regulation  imposing  small  per-family  costs
(say,  $30  per  family  for  200  million  people)  should be  treated  as  identical  to  a
regulation  imposing  the  same  aggregate  but  higher  per-family  costs  (say,  $300
per  family  for  20  million  people).  High  per-family  costs  do  raise  particular
concerns.  But a  regulation  that  badly  fails  cost-benefit  balancing  should  not  be
accepted  on  the  ground  that  each  family  or  person  will  pay  little.  (Imagine  a
program  that  would  require  every  American  to  pay  $1 per  year for  little  or  no
return.)

229.  "But  we  have  seen  instances,  particularly  in  the West  and  Midwest,  where  arsenic  is  naturally
occurring  at  up  to  700  and  more  parts  per  billion,  where  the  cost  of remediation  has  forced  water
companies  to  close,  leaving  people  with  no  way  to get  their  water,  save  dig  wells.  And  then  they  are
getting  water that's  even  worse than  what  they  were  getting  through  the  water company."  Evans, Novak,

THE  GEORGETOWN  LAW  JOURNAL

[Vol.  90:2255

Yet  another  tiebreaker  is  possible.  Perhaps  the  EPA  should  refrain  from
further  regulation  on  the  theory  that  government  should  not  act unless  there  is  a
clear  demonstration  that  it is desirable,  all  things  considered.  Perhaps  we should
adopt  a presumption  against  regulatory  controls  unless CBA  shows  that they  are
justified  or unless  there are special  reasons-perhaps  distributional  in character-
that  support  them.  Perhaps  the  government  should  not  require  costly  expendi-
tures  here in  view  of the  fact that the same  expenditures might be  used for other goals,
such  as crime reduction  and automobile  safety, where  they could do  more good.232

The problem  is  that  the  same  kind  of  argument  could  have  been  used  against
a  wide  range  of environmental  regulations  even  though  those regulations  have,
on  balance,  been  vindicated  by  history.2 33  In  the  context  of  air  quality  regula-
tion,  a  contemporaneous  assessment  of  costs  and  benefits  would  in  many  cases
have  given  rise to  the  same kind  of uncertainty  found  here.  Note  that  this  is  not
to  suggest  that  in  such  cases  the  costs  would  have  been  found  to  outweigh  the
benefits.  The problem  is  instead  that  the most  that could  have  been done  was  to
identify  a  benefits  range  leaving  a  great  deal  of uncertainty  about  what  to  do.  If
the  past  is  any  guide,  it  suggests  that inaction  in  such circumstances  would be  a
foolish  course.

3.  Between  the Poles?

While  no particular  approach  would be obviously  best  or obviously  unreason-
able,  the  more reasonable  approaches  would appear  to  be between  the  poles.  On
the  existing  numbers,  the  3  ppb  standard  is  hard  to  justify.  No  data  support  the
view  that  there  would  be  significant  health  gains  from  moving  from  a  10  ppb
ceiling  to  one  of 3  ppb.23 4  In  view  of the  significant  expense  of the  restriction,
10  ppb  seems  better.  At  the  same  time,  the  data  do  suggest  that  the  50  ppb
standard  is insufficiently  protective. A new  regulation  might  be  seen  as  a kind of
insurance  policy, one  without  an  enormous  price tag. A choice  that falls  between
the  50  and  3  ppb  ceiling  would  seem  to  be  best--especially  if  it  would  be
possible  to  relieve  the  high  burdens  imposed  on some  households.  Certainly  the
10  ppb  approach  is  reasonable.

This  last  point  raises  a  more  general  one,  overlooked  thus  far:  The  EPA's
menu  of alternatives  has  been  relatively  narrow  and  has  lacked  much  creativity.
The  EPA  discussed  four  different  permissible  exposure  levels  without  thinking
more  imaginatively  about  how  to  minimize  the  costs of arsenic  regulation.  The
blame  for  this  narrow  focus  lies  not  with  the  EPA,  but  with  Congress.  I  now
discuss  several  other  approaches,  designed  to  show  more  flexibility  toward
those burdened by  drinking  water regulation.

THE  ARITHMETIC  OF  ARSENIC

2297

B.  ARSENIC  TARGETING  AND  ARSENIC  WAIVING

A  possible  approach  would  involve  "targeting,"  that  is  imposing  regulation  on
water  systems  when  the  cost-benefit  ratio  is  especially  good.  Recall  that  for much  of
the  country,  the  cost  of  compliance  with  the  10  ppb  standard  is  quite  low.  On
plausible-which  is  not  to  say  certainly  correct-assumptions,  the  cost-benefit  ratio
for  those  systems  is  adequate  to  justify  the  regulation-perhaps  even  adequate  to
support  a 5  ppb  or 3  ppb standard.  These points  suggest  a simple alternative:  Impose a
targeted  rule,  with  a  sliding  scale  of  regulations  ensuring  that  the  cost-benefit  ratio
supports  the outcome  in  each area.  When, for example, the annual  cost of regulation  is
less  than  $50  per  household,  government  might  impose  a  5  ppb  standard;  when  the
annual  cost  is  less  than  $150,  it  might impose  a  10 ppb  standard;  when  it  is less  than
$350, it might  impose a  20 ppb  standard.

An  approach  of this  kind  would  undoubtedly  be  controversial.  Critics  would
ask:  Why  should  people  in  some  parts  of the  country  be  subject  to  more  arsenic
in  their  drinking  water  than  people  in  other  areas?  Why  should  some  people
have  very  low  levels  of  arsenic,  and  other  people  less  low  levels?  These
questions  might  seem  especially  difficult  to  answer  if, as  seems  likely, many  of
those  subject to  the  more  lenient  standard  would be  relatively  poor. Why  should
poor people,  and especially  poor children,  face levels  of arsenic  found  unaccept-
ably  dangerous  in  other  parts  of the  country?  But  these  questions  have  much
more  rhetorical  force  than  they  deserve.  If  acceptable  levels  of  risk  are  a
function  of both  cost  and  benefit,  it  makes  perfect  sense  to  say  that  such  levels
will  vary  depending  on  the  costs  and  benefits  of controls  in  different  localities.
In  some  areas  of the  country, it  will  be  worthwhile  to  "purchase"  an  additional
increment  of safety;  in other  areas,  it will  not be.

This  point  seems  sufficient  to  suggest  that  the EPA  should  have  the  authority
to  impose  national  standards  that are  not uniform.2 35  But the  SDWA forbids  any
such  nonuniform  standards.  In  keeping  with  its  cost-benefit  focus,  the  statute
should be amended  to allow  the EPA greater  flexibility.

If the EPA cannot  adopt  a targeted  regulation,  could  it allow  waivers  for areas
in which  the  benefits  do  not justify  the costs?  Once  the data  are disaggregated,  it
seems  reasonable  to  consider  the  following  option:  Adopt  the  10 ppb  regulation
for  most  water  systems,  when  the  per-family  cost  of  compliance  is  low,  but
offer  a  variance  for  water  systems  when  the  per-family  cost  is  high.  This
approach  would  be  quite close  to  one  involving  targeted  regulation.  The  SDWA
does  allow  waivers,  but  only  for  short  periods  of  time,  and  hence  waivers
produce less  satisfactory  outcomes  than  does  targeting.

C.  ARSENIC  MARKETS

In  contemporary  environmental  law,  some  of  the  most  dramatic  develop-
ments  have  involved  the  rise  of  market  instruments  for  pollution  control.  These

235.  1 am  not discussing  whether  national  controls  can be justified  in principle.

2298

THE  GEORGETOWN  LAW JOURNAL

[Vol.  90:2255

instruments  take  many  forms,  but  among  the  most  popular  are  "cap  and  trade"
systems,  in  which  the  total  level  of emissions  is  capped  at  a  certain  level  and
polluters  are allowed  to  trade  licenses  as  long as  the cap  is respected.2 36  A chief
advantage  of cap-and-trade  systems  is that  they ensure  the  lowest-cost  means of
achieving  regulatory  goals.  Those  who  can  eliminate  pollution  cheaply  will  do
exactly  that. Those  for  whom  reductions  are  expensive  will  purchase  additional
permits.

Why  not  create  a  system of tradeable  emissions  rights,  involving  the  right  to
subject  people  to  arsenic?  The  idea  may  well  seem  macabre.  But  if  so,  the
reason  is  likely to  be  a  belief that  arsenic  is a  poison  seriously  dangerous  at  any
level.  This is  a  form  of intuitive  toxicology. If we  suppose  that  within the  range
under  discussion  (say  3  ppb  to  20  ppb)  dangerously  high  exposure  levels  will
not occur, and  we  suppose  that  the  issue  is  one  of appropriate  degrees  of safety,
we  could  easily  imagine  a  cap-and-trade  system.  For  example,  government
could  create  an overall  cap  on arsenic  and  give licenses  to  subject people  to  15
ppb,  but  also  allow  trading.  As  a  result,  companies  that  can  reduce  at low  cost
will  do  so, whereas  those  that  can  do  so  at only  high  cost will  stay  at  15  ppb  or
perhaps  buy  licenses  to  subject  people  to  higher levels.  Because  of the  familiar
"hot  spots"  problem,  government  would,  under this  regime,  take  steps  to ensure
that no one  is subjected  to  unacceptably  high levels-say, 25 ppb  or higher.

As  compared  with  a system  of national command-and-control,  it  is likely  that
a  system  of  this  kind  would  produce  much  lower  costs.  Indeed,  a  system  of
tradeable  rights  would  likely  spur  considerable  innovation  in  arsenic  control
technology,  which  would  be  a  significant  gain. To  evaluate  it,  we  would want  to
know  the  aggregate  cost  of the  system  and  also  compare  the  likely  benefits  to
those  that  would  be enjoyed  under  the  alternatives.  It is  not unimaginable  that  a
properly  designed  cap-and-trade  system  would  produce  both  lower  costs  and
higher  benefits  than  the  command-and-control  alternative.  Note  in  this  regard
that  the  Clinton Administration  proposed  a  10  ppb  ceiling  to  be  applied  nation-
ally, but  that  a cap-and-trade  system  could ensure  that  people  would have  levels
well below  10 ppb  in  much  of the country.

As  compared  with  a  system  of  arsenic  targeting,  the  chief  advantage  of  a
cap-and-trade  system  is  that  it  imposes  less  of an  informational  demand  on  the
government,  allowing  the  market  rather  than  the  EPA  to  ascertain  the  costs  of
arsenic  reduction.  Under  arsenic  targeting,  the  EPA  would  have  to  decide,  in
every  area  of  the  country,  the  real  costs  of  reduction  to  various  points-a
difficult  determination  for  which  error  is  inevitable.  Under  cap  and  trade,  those
with  low  costs  will  trade  their  licenses,  whereas  those  with  high  costs  will
attempt  to  acquire  more  in  the  way  of  arsenic  rights.  Of  course  the  same
objections  that might be  made  to  arsenic  targeting  might be  made  to  a  system  of
cap-and-trade.  Perhaps  poor  people  will  be  subject  to  unusually  high  arsenic

levels. But  if these  objections  are  not convincing  there,  they  are  also  unconvinc-
ing in this  context.

Under  the  SDWA,  however,  the  EPA  lacks  the  authority  to  implement  a
trading  system for  arsenic.  This  is  a  serious  gap.  The  statute  should be  amended
to allow  the EPA  to permit  trading  if the evidence justifies  that step.  I emphasize
that  trading  should  not  be  allowed  to  create  what  are,  under  existing  science,
unacceptable  hot spots.

D.  ARSENIC  REDUCTION  SUBSIDIES
It  might  be  suggested  that  the  EPA  should  impose  a  stringent  regulation  of
arsenic but  that the  federal  government  should  subsidize  communities  for which
the  annual cost is  high. Of course  the EPA  cannot offer  subsidies on  its own. But
perhaps  Congress  should  do  so.  In  fact,  Congress  has  made  federal  financial
assistance  available  for  water systems,  and  while  the  relevant  programs  contain
a  degree  of  discretion,  it  is  certainly  possible  for  financially  strapped  water
systems  to  receive  federal  help.2 37

Recall  that  the  total  cost  of  the  10  ppb  regulation  would  be  about  $210
million  each  year. To  say  the  least, this  would  not  be  a  large  sum  in  the  federal
budget.  If the  federal  government  restricted  itself to  paying  the  cost of compli-
ance  in  areas  in  which  the  annual  per-household  cost  exceeds  $100,  its  total
taxpayer bill would be  about $10  million-hardly  a  large sum  to pay.

This  would not be  a  foolish approach  to  the  arsenic problem.  In  fact,  it seems
quite  reasonable.  The  major difficulty  is that  the  numbers  do not  tell us  whether
this  is  the best way  to  spend limited taxpayer  dollars.  Suppose  that  the risks that
the  regulation  is  reducing  are  quite  small,  so  that  the  regulation  will  save
somewhere  between  0  and  0.5  lives.  Is  it  really  worth  spending  $10  million to
save  between  0  and  0.5  lives?  Many  government  programs  are  designed  to
decrease  risks  to  life  and  health;  some  of  those  programs  attempt  to  reduce
violent crime.  Perhaps  the  $10  million  would  be better  spent  on those  programs.
It would  be possible  to  say that, as a  practical  matter, any  $10  million  subsidy  is
more  likely  to  come  from  some  other,  less  valuable  use  and  that  by  using  it  to
protect  people  against  the  health  hazards  of  arsenic,  we  would  not  really  be
diverting  resources  from  a  more  valuable  use.  Among  the  universe  of  imagin-
able  government  expenditures,  a  $10  million  subsidy  is hardly  the  worst. But  in
light  of existing  data, we  cannot  be  sure  that  it  is  the  best. The  same  consider-
ations  that justify  cost-benefit  balancing  in  the  first  place  suggest  that the  hard
issues  cannot  be  avoided  by  arguing  for  an  across-the-board  10  ppb  standard
accompanied  by  a  federal  subsidy  for  those  who  face  a  difficult  financial
burden.

E.  ARSENIC  DISCLOSURE
An  alternative  possibility  would  be  to  rely  less  on  regulation  and  more  on
information.  In  many  domains  of regulatory  policy,  government  has  moved  to
replace  command-and-control  regulation  with  efforts  to  require  companies  to
disclose  their  activities  and  the  accompanying  risks  to  the  public.23 8  In  the
context  at  hand,  the  suggestion  would  be  simple:  Require  companies  to  meet
some  statutory  requirement-perhaps  30 ppb-so that people  are  not exposed  to
clear  harm,  but  beyond  that  point,  require  companies  to  disclose  the  level  of
arsenic  in  their  drinking  water,  perhaps  with  information  that  would  put  the
numbers  into  some context.  Perhaps  the  disclosure  requirement  would  not  apply
if companies  reached  some  low level  (5  ppb?).  We could  thus  imagine  a  kind  of
three-tiered  rule  with  flat mandates,  a disclosure  requirement  for a  certain  range,
and  a "floor"  below  which  companies would  have  no disclosure  duties.

For  arsenic,  this  strategy  would  have  both  advantages  and  disadvantages.
Because  people  are  not  likely  to  be  happy  to  learn  that  their  drinking  water  has
relatively high  levels  of arsenic,  one advantage  of disclosure  is  that it could  spur
companies  to  reduce  arsenic  levels  on  their  own,  without  governmental  require-
ments. 2 39  For  companies  who  chose  that  route,  it  is  likely  that  the  reductions
would  not  be  terribly  expensive.  Public  pressure  may  produce  low-cost  reduc-
tions  in  some  areas  while  also  allowing  companies  to  maintain  certain  levels  of
arsenic  if the  public  in  those  areas  was  not  so  concerned  in  light  of the  mix  of
health benefits  and  water  costs.  In  this  way, disclosure  may  even produce  a  kind
of "drinking  water  federalism."  Another  advantage  of disclosure  is  that  it  may
perform  an  important  educative  role  by  ensuring  that  people  will  learn  that
some  carcinogenic  substances  are  not  especially  dangerous  at  low  levels  and
also alerting  people  to the  need  for tradeoffs  (in the  form  of a  higher water bill).
But  of  course  there  are  pitfalls  as  well.  We  have  seen  that  the  very  idea  of
arsenic  in drinking  water seems  to  cause  serious  public  alarm,  in  part because  of
the  operation  of intuitive  toxicology.  For a  certain percentage  of  the population,
disclosure  of arsenic  would itself  signal  reason  for concern  and perhaps  produce
excessive  fear,  even  panic.  Many  people  may  ask  why,  exactly,  companies  are
disclosing  this  fact  and  whether  disclosure  means  that  they  are,  in  some  sense,
being  poisoned.  The  point  suggests  that  sometimes  disclosure  will  not  really
inform  people  because  their  background  beliefs  will  lead  them  to  read  the
information  badly.  The  question  remains  whether  it  is  possible  to  give  some
contextual  information  so  that  people  have  an  accurate  sense  of  what  the
disclosure  actually  means.  In  this  context,  we  should  probably  be  unsure
whether the contextual  information  would  really  help.

As  a  legal  matter,  the  issue  is  simple  because  the  EPA  has  no  authority  to  use
information  disclosure  as  a  substitute  for  regulation.  In  the  particular  context  of  the
SDWA, Congress's  choice  for regulatory  mandates may  even make  sense.  But  in  the
future,  it  would  be  useful  to  allow  agencies  to  experiment  in  this  vein  to  see  if
disclosure will,  in some  cases, do  more good  than  alternative  approaches.

F.  THE  MISSING  QUESTION:  DISTRIBUTIONAL  ISSUES

There  is  one  significant  gap  in  the  discussion  thus  far:  A  full  account  of  the
distributional effects  of different  arsenic  regulations.  To  have  an  adequate  sense  of
whether  and  how  to  proceed,  it would  be  most  valuable  to  match  the  assessment  of
the range  of costs of the  rule  with an  account  of the income  and wealth  of those who
will  be  subject to  those  costs.  If, for example,  those  who  would  bear $300  or more  in
increased  annual  costs  are  also  disproportionately  poor,  there  is  good  reason  for
government to hesitate  before  imposing the regulation. It is easy to  imagine a situation
in  which water quality  regulation is  "regressive"  in  the sense  that its costs come  down
especially hard on  poor people. That  is not a decisive  objection  to the regulation, but it
is certainly  an important point to consider.

It  would  be  easy  to  imagine  the  following  sort  of rejoinder:  Shouldn't  poor
people  have  water  that  is  as  safe  as  that  of wealthy  people?  Why  should  poor
people,  including  poor  children,  have  water  quality  inferior  to  that  enjoyed  by
wealthy  people?  The  simplest  answer  is  that  safety  is  a  matter of  degree,  and  if
safer water  quality  is  very  expensive,  then  poor  people  are better  off without  it
than  with  it.  Cars  should  certainly  be  safe,  but  wealthy  people  are  more  likely
than  poor  people  to  buy Volvos.  It would  not be  a  good  idea for the  government
to  force  poor  people  to  buy  Volvos,  and  the  reason  is  that  if you  are  poor,  you
might  reasonably  use  what  money  you  have  on something  other  than  adding  an
additional  margin  of  safety  to  your  car.  Perhaps  you  will  use  that  money  on
food,  or  medical  care,  or  shelter.  The  same  is  true  for  water  quality.  If  the
consequence  of  decreasing  (small)  risks  is  to  decrease  significantly  family
income  for  poor  people,  then  it  is  perfectly  legitimate  for  the  government  to
it  is  possible  that  the  benefits  of  environmental
refuse  to  act.  Of  course 
regulation  will  be  enjoyed  disproportionately  by  poor  people  and  that  they  will
bear disproportionately  few  of the costs.

The  more  general  suggestion  is  that  whenever  an  agency  is  producing  a
regulatory  impact  analysis,  it  should consider a  distributional  analysis  as  well.  It
is  important  to  know  who  will  bear  both  the  benefits  and  the  burdens  of
regulation.  A  recent  study  shows,  for  example,  that  the  benefits  of  pollution
control  in  California  have  gone  disproportionately  to  poor people  and  minority
group  members. 240  It  would be  extremely  desirable  to  assemble  similar  informa-
tion  for drinking  water regulation.

CONCLUSION

My  aim  in  this Article  has been  to  cast light  on the  actual  practice  of  CBA by
considering  the  EPA's  most  highly  publicized  decision  under  the  federal  statute
that  most  explicitly  calls  for  that  form  of  analysis.  The  basic  message  is  that
even  when  there  is  a  considerable  amount  of  scientific  data,  it  is  possible  that
CBA  will identify  only  a  range  of reasonable  choices,  and  often  a  wide  range  at
that.  With  plausible  assumptions,  the  nonmonetized  health  benefits  of  new
controls  on  arsenic  in  drinking  water  can  be  made  to  seem  very  small  or  very
large.  Once  the  health  benefits  are  monetized,  the  range  becomes  larger  still,
making  it extremely  difficult to compare  costs  against  benefits.

It  would  be  possible  to  take  this  demonstration  as  an  attack  on  CBA  on  the
ground  that  a  specification  of  benefits  and  costs  tells  us  little  that  we  did  not
already  know. 24'  If CBA  is justified  as  a  way  of actually  producing  decisions  in
hard  cases, CBA  has  indeed  been  criticized  by  the analysis  here.  But this would
be  the  wrong  lesson.  As  a  substitute  for  intuitive  toxicology  and  for  the
crudeness  of the  affect  heuristic,  an  effort  to  trace  both  costs  and  benefits  can
inform  inquiry  making  decisions  less  of  a  stab  in  the  dark.  This  is  indeed  a
substantial  gain.  Once  the  range  is  specified,  a judgment  of  value,  and  not  of
fact,  will  be involved  in  the ultimate  decision  whether  or not  to proceed.  But the
judgment  of  value  will  be  easier  to  identify  once  we  understand  what  we
understand  and  what  we  do  not know.  A  real  virtue  of CBA  is  that  it  helps  to
explain  exactly  why  the  choice  of regulation  in  the  case  of arsenic  is  genuinely
difficult.  In  this  way  CBA  is  a  large  improvement  over  the  "intuitive  toxicol-
ogy"  seen  in the public  reaction  to the decision  of the Bush Administration.

I  have  also  attempted  to  provide  a  kind  of  lawyer's  primer  on  the  law  of
CBA,  showing  how  future  cases  might  be  litigated.  There  is  no  question  that
courts  will  eventually  be  asked  to  assess  the  kinds  of questions  raised  in  this
Article.2 42  Lawyers  can drive  predicted benefits  up or down  by manipulating  the
dose-response  curve,  by  raising  epidemiological  questions,  by  challenging  the
discount  rate,  by  asking  about  the  voluntariness  and  controllability  of the  risk,
and  by quantifying  difficult-to-quantify  risks.  We  could  easily  imagine  a  dozen
kinds  of  opinions  invalidating  a  10  ppb  standard  as  too  stringent;  we  could
easily  imagine  the  same  number  of  opinions  invalidating  that  standard  as  too
lenient.  Indeed,  we  could  easily  imagine  an  emerging  set of doctrines  in  which
courts produce  a kind  of common  law  of CBA.  In view  of the  complexity  of the
underlying  questions,  many  diverse  views  would  undoubtedly  be  expressed  by
federal  courts.  I  have  urged  that  things  would  be  simplified,  and  generally
better,  if courts  maintained  a  posture  of deference,  rejecting  agency  views  only

241.  This  is  one  reading  of Heinzerling,  supra  note  16.
242.  See,  e.g.,  Corrosion  Proof  Fittings  v.  EPA,  947  F.2d  1201  (5th  Cir.  1991)  (asking  the  court  to
evaluate  a  number  of issues  explored  here,  including  the  appropriate  discount  rate  and  both  arbitrary
and  nonarbitrary  ways  to balance costs and  benefits).

in  cases  in  which  those  views  are  patently  unreasonable.  There  is  indeed  an
emerging  common  law  of  cost-benefit  analysis, 2 43  but  thus  far  it  is  being
generated by  agencies rather  than  courts. This  is  entirely  proper.

I  have  also  discussed  the  underlying  policy  issues.  The  EPA  could  make
many  reasonable  decisions  here,  and  in  the  range  below  50  ppb  and  above  5
ppb,  there  is  no  obviously  correct  choice.  But  my  principal  claims  have  in-
volved  broadening  the  agencies'  view  screen.  First,  agencies  should  have  the
flexibility  to  produce  variable  standards  targeting  regulation  to  areas  where  it
would  survive  cost-benefit  balancing  and  also  adopting  economic  incentives  to
ensure  low-cost  solutions.  Second,  agencies  should  be  required  to  identify  the
winners  and  losers  produced  by  regulation-to  show  when  poor  people  or
wealthy  people  are  disproportionate  losers  or  gainers.  A  distributional  analysis
should  not  be  taken  as  conclusive,  but  it  will  help  to  inform  the  analysis.  An
effort  to  increase  agency  flexibility  and  also to  identify  both  winners  and  losers
would  be natural  steps  not toward  placing  regulatory judgments  in an  arithmetic
straightjacket,  but  toward  ensuring  that  when  government  acts,  it  does  so  in  a
way that  is  informed by a  full account  of the consequences.

APPENDIX
Dose-Response  Curves

To  evaluate  risks  associated  with  toxic  substances  and  to  undertake  cost-
benefit analysis,  it  is  often  important  to have  a  sense  of the dose-response  curve.
For  arsenic,  clear  evidence  is  absent.  This  appendix  offers  a  sense  of  the
possibilities.

The dose-response  curve  can have  a  variety of shapes, including  linear, where
response  increases  proportionally  with  dose.  Figure  (A)(1)  displays  the  linear
relationship  between  dietary  dose  of  organophosphate  insecticide  dioxathion
and  inhibition  of the enzyme  cholinesterase  in rats.

Figure  (A)(2)  demonstrates  another  linear  relationship,  this  one  between
subcutaneous  administration  of carcinogenic  hydrocarbon  dibenzanthracene  and
tumor  incidence  in mice.

Chemicals  such  as  benzene,  radon,  and  formaldehyde  exhibit sublinear  dose-
response  relationships,  where  elicited  responses  are  less  than  proportional.
Figure  (B)(1)  displays  a  sublinear  relationship  for  primary  pulmonary  (lung)
tumors  in rats following  exposure  to  plutonium dioxide.

Figure  (B)(2)  exhibits  a  sublinear  dose-response  relationship  between  the
number  of  female  rat  liver  foci  (a  precursor  to  cancer)  and  the  log  dose  of
phenobarbital  expressed  as picomole per kilogram.

Some  chemicals  produce  no adverse  effects  below  a  certain  level,  resulting in
a threshold  curve. Threshold-model  agents  include  dioxins  and chrysotile  asbes-

tos;  in  addition,  nongenotoxic  carcinogens  are  generally  assumed  to  have
threshold  doses.  Figure  (C)(1)  demonstrates  a  threshold  for  the  carcinogenic
hydrocarbon  benzpyrene  causing  sarcomas  in  mice.

Dose-response  relationships  exceeding  proportionality,  such  as  vinyl  chlo-
ride,  are  supralinear.  Figure  (D)(1)  demonstrates  a  supralinear  curve  for  the
inhibition  of carboxylesterase  enzyme  activities  in  rats  as  a  function  of  insecti-
cide  dioxathion  dose.

The  slight  concave-upward  pattern  in  Figure  (D)(2)  demonstrates  a  weaker
supralinear  relationship  between  exposure  to  radiation  via  an  atomic  bomb  and
cancer  deaths per  10,000 people.

Hermatic chemicals  such  as  essential  nutrients and  vitamins  exhibit beneficial
effects  at  low  doses,  coupled  with  toxic  effects  at  high  doses,  resulting  in  a
u-shaped  curve.  The  dose-response  relationship  of fluoride,  which  exerts  posi-
tive  effects  at lower  doses  but is toxic  at high  doses,  is outlined in  Figure  (E)(1).
