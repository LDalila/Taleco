In Association of Data Processing Serv Org v Camp,1 the Supr Court, in an opinion written by Justice William O. Douglas, re lutionized the law of standing.

It is astonishing but true that the Supreme Court has given very little guidance on a key issue in modern administrative law: how injuries should be characterized for purposes of standing. Its most serious and sustained confrontation with the issue came last term in Northeastern Florida Chapter of the Associated General Contractors v Jacksonville (hereafter Northeastern Contractors)." The result and the reasoning in the case are in conspicuous tension with other Supreme Court precedents, most of them quite recent. And the Court's distinctive approach, offered in an intriguing setting, has the potential to allow the Court to sort out much of the law in this area, and also to move standing doctrine in some generally salutary directions. This is so especially in light of the fact that, as we will see, the Northeastern Contractors case exposes the fundamental flaw in Data Processing-the view that it is possible to identify injuries without looking at law. One of the important legacies of Northeastern Contractors will be the understanding that in characterizing injury, it is the law that counts. In deciding whether there is standing, what matters is what the law says. There can be no law-free inquiry into the subject of injury. This will be my principal claim here.

AGC's members are mostly They regularly bid and perf of Jacksonville. They comp excluded from bidding on the minority business enterpris non-minority members of A if not for the set-aside prog provides a cause of action fo state law, they claimed that of the laws.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that AGC lacked standing. " The key point was that its members had not alleged that they "would have bid more successfully on any one or more of these contracts if not for the ordinance."'16 They therefore could not show injury in fact. In the court's view, it was purely speculative to say that if the program were invalidated, AGC's members would be awarded any additional contracts. The plaintiffs action thus ran afoul of a number of Supreme Court decisions holding that there must be a concrete and definable injury to the plaintiff, one that was attributable to the defendant's conduct and likely to be remedied by a decree in the plaintiff's favor.17
The Supreme Court reversed." The centerpiece of the Court's decision consisted of a description of the injury not as a failure to receive a contract, but instead as an inability to compete. This description of the injury stemmed from the Court's understanding of the Equal Protection Clause. "When the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another group, a member of the former group seeking to challenge the barrier need not alleged that he would have obtained the benefit but for the barrier

And in an intriguing and note, the Court added that because of th injury, the redressability requirements w the Court appeared to say that since the in with the opportunity to compete, it wa conduct and it also followed that any ju tiffs' favor would remedy their injury. The Court was aware that its decision was in some conflict with earlier outcomes, especially that in Warth v Seldin.23 In the Warth case, the Court had denied standing to a construction association that was seeking to challenge an allegedly discriminatory zoning ordinance. In trying to come to terms with Warth, the Court made two points. First, the association in Warth did not contend that it could not apply for variances and permits on an equal basis its complaint was that it could not obtain variances and permits. Second, there was no allegation in Warth that any members had actually applied for a permit or variance for a current project. Here, by contrast, actual applications were alleged.24
It is not necessary to linger long over the questio Court's decision was correct. Section 1983 confers a cause of action on people whose federal rights have been violated by state law.

At least this is what the Court in Northeastern Contractors seemed to assume. Some such assumption must be implicit in the Court's readiness to characterize the injury as involving an opportunity rather than a more discrete harm.
There is one possible line of response to this argument, suggested in the recent cases29 though, surprisingly, not even discussed in Northeastern Contractors. Certainly courts ought to minimize the occasions for intervening with political processes almost certainly this is especially so if we are dealing with a constitutional attack on state law. If the plaintiffs' interest is widely shared-and any "opportunity" is by definition likely to be widely shared-perhaps judges should refuse to interfere with the outcomes of electoral processes. And if the interest is as broad as the opportunity to compete, it is indeed going to be widely shared. On this view, th construction contractors in Northeastern Contractors-perhaps no incidentally, members of the white majority,30 though this particular point need not be emphasized here-ought to have been forced to rely on the political process unless and until they could show that contracts would actually have been awarded to them. Withou such a showing, all they had was a "generalized grievance," one that is best taken up before legislative bodies. Courts ought, in short, to require tangible, concrete harm, rather than injury to opportunities, as a way of minimizing the occasions for interfering

The Suprem phasize this point-the creation of a c whose federal rights have been violated major gap in the opinion. The Court did n source of federal law that conferred a plaintiffs. But if we attend to section 198 simple.
One final issue. In many cases since Data Processing, the Court has been faced with the implicit issue of how to characterize injuries in standing cases.36 Often the question is whether to characterize an injury in terms that are familiar to the common law. At common law, a discrete wrongdoer typically imposes a discrete wrong on a discrete person at an easily identifiable time. This is the basic form of the common law allegation, and it can easily be transplanted to the administrative law setting, where we might ask whether the same framework is at work. In public law cases, however, it is possible that the common law understanding should be rejected, on the theory that it is poorly adapted to the goals and functions of the modern state. The alternative is to characterize an injury as involving (for example) an increased probability of harm, an injury to an opportunity, or a failure to have potential wrongdoers face the kinds of incentives that Congress (or the Constitution) seeks to impose on them. In many cases the Court has opted for the common law characterization, and thus denied standing, when the public law alternative was fully available. Strikingly, in Northeastern Contractors the Court seemed to think that a common lawlike understanding, one that speaks in terms of discrete harms to discrete people, would make no sense the Equal Protection Clause protects the opportunity to compete, not the award of contracts. We need not quarrel with this result in order to insist that the Court ought to have explained how this characterization of the injury fits, or fails to fit, with other cases. And it is here that the case leaves a conspicuous gap not only in logic but also for the future.

From what has been said thus far, it seems clear that Northeastern Contractors does not coexist easily with recent cases and trends in the area of standing. For this reason the case, though seemingly minor and technical, raises a host of complex and novel issues. It will be useful to begin by showing how the same analytic strategy used in Northeastern Contractors might have been used in a wide range of cases in which standing was denied. That strategy consists of recharacterizing the injury so as to ensure simultaneous compliance with the requirements of injury in fact and redressability.37
Consider, for example, Linda RS v Richard D. 38 It will be recalled that the case involved a complaint that the local prosecutor had failed to prosecute fathers of illegitimate children for failure to provide child support. The plaintiff claimed that the discriminatory prosecution policy was in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The Court denied standing. On the Court's analysis, the problem for purposes of standing was that the plaintiff could not show that her injury would be redressed by a decree in her favor. Perhaps the father would simply go to prison. Structurally, this approach is the same as that of the Court of Appeals in Northeastern Contractors. The failure of redressability stemmed from the narrow characterization of the injury, just as the broad characterization of the injury in Northeastern Contractors eliminated any problem with redressability.
But it would have been equally plausible to say that the injury suffered in Linda RS involved not the absence of child support, but the opportunity to ensure that payments by the child's father were subject to the same incentives as everyone else similarly situated. That was the violation of the equality principle, and with respect to that violation, there was no problem with either injury or redressability-just as in Northeastern Contractors. Imagine, for example, if a local prosecutor initiated proceedings against white fathers

II. PRECEDENTS AND PUZZLES
for child support, but not against blac such circumstances a mother of a child whose father is black complains that the discrimination has made it impossible for her to support her child. Would there be any problem with standing? Certainly there should not be,39 and Northeastern Contractors is a powerful precedent in her favor. The injury consists not of the absence of child support, but of the fact that her opportunity to receive child support is not subject to the same incentives as that of others similarly situated.
The only difference between Linda RS and Northeastern Contractors is that the former involved an action against a criminal prosecutor to enforce the law. It therefore raised the arguably distinctive considerations involved in a proceeding by a private party against the government to require it to proceed against another private party. In Lujan v Defenders of Wildlife,40 the Supreme Court brought out this point, which had been largely implicit in several other cases.41 In Lujan, the Court said that a case in which a plaintiff sought enforcement action was the weakest case for standing. In the Court's view, the injury in such cases is especially likely to be speculative. As we have seen, however, whether the injury is speculative cannot be decided in the abstract everything depends on how the injury is described.42 On that particular question, there is no difference between an ordinary action and one brought against the government for unlawful enforcement activity. On that particular question, it is utterly irrelevant whether the government is being asked to initiate proceedings. If the injury is characterized broadly, as it was in Northeastern Contractors, this difference should not make a difference. Certainly there is no Article II problem with a suit against a state or local prosecutor for unlawful discrimination.43
Perhaps Article II concerns should bear on standing in cases in which the federal executive is the defendant. But any such concerns should be analytically separate. They should not be folded into the inquiry whether the injury is "speculative." The merger of these two questions-both complex enough-is a recipe for confusion.

We cannot come up with a simple approach to unite the appropriate characterization of injuries in cases involving consumers, radio listeners, victims of discrimination, environmentalists, purchasers of securities, and many more.

that discrete harms-of the sort demanded in EKWRO and Allenmust be shown in the typical administrative law case.
On the approach I am suggesting, ideas of this sort would not have constitutional status. Congress could override the presumption against standing for "opportunity-type" harms by a clear statement. When it has done so, standing should be available for regulatory beneficiaries, however numerous, and however much courts will be overseeing (for legality) enforcement action. This is one way to understand things in the area of environmental law, where beneficiary suits are plentiful, and where Congress has firmly endorsed them.63 The common law model of standing would serve only to provide the background understandings against which to understand congressional silence. It would disallow suits by especially numerous beneficiaries unless Congress has said otherwise. Narrow characterization of the injury would really be a proxy for the relevant background understandings. In deciding standing cases, we would really be talking not of "injury in fact," but of the appropriate allocation of authority among Congress, courts, and agencies.
This approach has the advantage of synthesizing a good deal of current law. It helps reconcile Northeastern Contractors with the cases that preceded it, most notably Allen v Wright and Lujan. It explains why the strategy in Northeastern Contractors-broad characterization of the injury-would not make sense when regulatory beneficiaries are seeking to compel enforcement action. The capacity for rationalization itself counts as a strong argument in favor of this approach.
2. The public law model. A competing view would stress two points. First, the common law model is untrue to the best understanding of Congress' goals and expectations. Second, the relevant constitutional concerns are without force. Suits by regulatory beneficiaries produce no constitutional difficulties.
The initial point here is that regulatory statutes are rooted in ideas quite foreign to the common law. Typically they are enacted not to prevent discrete harms by discrete actors, but to restructure incentives or to ensure against what we might describe as probable or systemic harms. When Congress requires an environmental impact statement, for example, it is trying to restructure incentives

In any event, the regulated entities are, by hypothesis, entitled to judicial relief they need not resort to the political process. Here too it is important to avoid building an asymmetry into the law of standing.71 None of this means that plaintiffs need not show an interest at all. But it does mean that in deciding whether a legal interest is at stake, the constitutional considerations do not counsel against granting standing to people who invoke "opportunity-type" harms.
The same considerations suggest the difficulty of invoking Arti-

Northeastern Contractors is the Court's first sustained encounter with a key issue in the new law of standing: the appropriate characterization of injuries. The Court's conclusion is unobjectionable, and there is nothing terribly wrong with the particular reasoning that underlay that conclusion. Section 1983 grants a cause of action to all those whose federal rights have been invaded by state law. The contractors in Northeastern Contractors complained that the set-aside program violated their constitutional rights. The Equal Protection Clause safeguards not particular outcomes, but general opportunities and if the plaintiffs were correct on the merits, their legal rights had been violated.
The basic problem with Northeastern Contractors is conceptual,

Although a trend in this direction would be salutary, the Court has a large task of sorting out the relations among its previous decisions, nearly all of which ignore the issue of how to characterize injuries for purposes of standing. Northeastern Contractors fits poorly with the many cases in which the Court assumed or asserted a narrow characterization of the relevant injury. In all of those cases, the Court might easily have done what it did in Northeastern Contractors. It now remains to decide how the question of characterization is to be resolved.
I have suggested here that the answer lies in positive law it depends on congressional (or constitutional) instructions. Recognition of this point would itself be a significant advance insofar as it would maintain fidelity with both the Administrative Procedure Act and relevant constitutional provisions. But often congressional instructions are unclear, and they must be constructed on the basis of an understanding of the legislative and constitutional background. In the modern regulatory state, statutes are typically designed to restructure incentives, to diminish risks, or to protect opportunities, rather than to guarantee particular results to particular people. If this is correct, a broad characterization of the injury is generally appropriate in administrative law cases. Hence the strategy used in Northeastern Contractors-recharacterization of the
