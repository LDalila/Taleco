at odds with academic
freedom.1 In recent years,
however, the development of
campus "speech codes" has
createda rangeof new
controversies.In these remarks,one of my
purposes is to defend the constitutionality of
narrowly drawn restrictionson hate speech,
arguing in the process againstthe
broaderversions that have become popular in some
institutions. My most generalgoal is to set the
dispute over speech codes in the broadercontext
of the liberalcommitment to freedom of
speech and academic pluralism.Through this
approachit may be possible to overcome the
"allor nothing" tone that has dominated much
of public and even academic discussion. In the

between different forms of speech
in terms of their relationship to
Constitutional ideals. Current
constitutional law does indeed make
such distinctions, asking whether
speech qualifies as "low-value"or
"high-value." Some speech lies at
the free speech "core."Such speech

the strongest showing of harm.</p>

      <p>Ordinary political speech, dealing with
governmental matters, unquestionably belongs at
the core. Such speech may not be regulated
unless there is a clear and present danger, or,
in the Supreme Court's words, unless it is
"directed to inciting or producing imminent
lawless action and is likely to incite or produce
such action."2 Under this standard,a speech

Panthers, or by neo Nazis during a march in
Skokie, Illinois, the home of many survivors
of concentration camps.</p>
      <p>But much speech falls into the peripheryof
constitutional concern. Commercial speech,
for example, receivessome constitutional
protection, in the sense that it qualifies as
"speech"within the meaning of the first
amendment. Truthful, nondeceptive
advertising is generallyprotected from regulation. But
government may regulatecommercial
advertising it if it is false or misleading. There are
many other kinds of "low-value"speech.
Consider threats, attempted bribes, perjury,
criminal conspiracy, price-fixing, criminal
solicitation, private libel, unlicensed medical and
legal advice, sexual and racialharassment.All
these can be regulatedwithout meeting the
ordinary, highly speech-protective standards.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court has not set out
anything like a clear theory to explain why and
when speech qualifies for the top tier. At
times the Court has indicated that speech
belongs in the top tier if it is part of the
exchange of ideas, or if it bears on the political
process.3 But apart from these ambiguous
hints, it has failed to tell us much about its
basis for deciding that some forms of
expression are different from others.</p>
      <p>Is a two-tier FirstAmendment inevitable or
desirable?Some people claim to be free speech
absolutists- they think they believe that all
speech is protected, or that speech can be
regulated only if the government can show
overwhelming harm. But it does seem that any
well-functioning system of free expression
must ultimately distinguish between different
kinds of speech by reference to their centrality
to the FirstAmendment guarantee.</p>
      <p>Begin with a truly absolutist position:
Anyone may say anything at all at any time. A
moment's reflection should show that this
position could not be seriously maintained. It
would not make sense to forbid government
from regulating perjury, bribes, threats,
fraudulent real estate deals, unlicensed medical and
legal advice, willfully false advertising, and
many other forms of expression. Realistically
speaking, our choices are a range of
nonabsolutionist approaches.</p>
      <p>It is tempting to resist this conclusion by
proposing that the speech that is unprotected
is "really"not speech at all, but merely action.
When someone attempts to bribe a
government official, perhaps he is "acting,"or
perhaps the regulation of criminal solicitation is
"ancillary"or "incidental"to the regulation of
conduct. But as stated, I think that this
suggestion is unhelpful. Criminal solicitation and
attempted bribes are speech, not action. They
may lead to action; but by themselves they are
simply words. If I tell you that I want you to
help me to commit an assault, I have spoken
words; if I say that I will give you $10,000 if
you vote for me, I have merely talked; if I say
"Kill!"to a trained attack dog, I have done
something regulable, but I have still just
spoken. If these things are to be treated as
action- that is, if they are not to be protected as
speech- it is because of their distinctive
features. This is what must be discussed. The
word "action"is simply a placeholder for that
unprovided discussion.</p>
      <p>So much for the speech-conduct distinction.
The only nonabsolutist alternativeto an
approach that looks at free speech "value"would
be this: All speech stands on basicallythe same
footing. We will not look at value at all. The
only relevant issue is one of harm. Speech may
be regulatedif government can make a
demonstration that the speech at issue will produce
sufficiendy bad consequences. Would it not be
possible, and desirable,to have a "singletier"
first amendment, in the sense that all speech is
presumed protected, but we allow government
to regulatespeech in those rarecaseswhere the
harm is very great?</p>
      <p>The answer is that it would not be plausible
to say that all speech stands on the same
footing. For example, courts should not test
regulation of campaign speeches under the same
standardsapplied to misleading commercial
speech, child pornography, conspiracies, libel
of private persons, and threats. If the same
standardswere applied, one of two results
would follow, and both are unacceptable.</p>
      <p>The first possible resultwould be to lower
the burden of justification for governmental
regulation as a whole, so as to allow for
restrictions on misleading commercial speech,
private libel, and so forth. If this were the
consequence, there would be an unacceptablyhigh
threat to political expression. Upon a
reasonably persuasiveshowing of harm, government
could regulate misleading campaign
statements, just like it can now regulatemisleading
proxy statements. A generallylowered burden
of justification would thereforebe intolerable.</p>
      <p>The second possible result is that courts
would apply the properly stringent standards
for regulation of political speech to (for
example) conspiracies, criminal solicitation,
commercial speech, private libel, and child
pornography. The central problem with this
approach is that it would ensure that
government could not control speech that should be
regulated. A system in which the most
stringent standardswere applied across the board
would ensure that government could not
regulate criminal solicitation, child pornography,
private libel, and false or misleading
commercial speech, among others. The harms that
justify such regulation are real, but they are
insufficient to permit government controls
under the extremely high standards applied to
regulation of political speech.</p>
      <p>If courts are to be honest about the matter,
an insistence that "allspeech is speech" would
mean that they must eliminate many
currently unobjectionable and even necessary
controls- or more likely that judgments
about value, because unavoidable, would
continue to be made, but covertly. We will soon
see that this claim bears directly on the
questions raised by speech codes and by academic
freedom generally.</p>
      <p>Thus far I have suggested that a workable
system of free expression ought to make
distinctions between different sorts of speech;
but it remains to decide by what standard
courts might accomplish this task. To support
an emphasis on politics, we need to define the
category of political speech. For present
purposes I will treat speech as political when it is
both intendedand receivedas a contributionto
public deliberationabout some issue.By
requiring intent, I do not mean to require a trial on
the question of subjective motivation.
Generally this issue can be resolved simply on the
basis of the nature of the speech at issue. By
requiring that the speech be received as a
contribution to public deliberation, I do not
mean that all listeners or readersmust see the
substantive content. It is sufficient if some do.</p>
      <p>An approach that affords special protection
to political speech, thus defined, is justified
on numerous grounds. Such an approach
receives firm support from history- not only
from the constitutional framers'theory of free
expression, but also from the development of
that principle through the history of
American law. There can be little doubt that
suppression by the government of political ideas
that it disapproved, or found threatening, was
the central motivation for the clause. The
worst examples of unacceptable censorship
involve efforts by government to insulate itself
from criticism. Judicial interpretations over
the course of time also support a political
conception of the First Amendment.</p>
      <p>This approach also seems likely to accord
fairlywell with our initial or considered
judgments about particularfree speech problems.
Any approach to the First Amendment will
have to take substantial account of those
judgments, and adjust itself accordingly. Of course
we are not unanimous in our considered
judgments. But it seems dear that such forms of
speech as perjury, bribery, threats, misleading
or false commercial advertising, criminal
solicitation, and libel of private persons- or at
least most of these- are not entitled to the
highest degree of constitutional protection.
No other general approach unifies initial or
preliminary judgments about these matters as
well as a political conception of the First
Amendment.</p>
      <p>In addition, an insistence that government's
burden is greatest when political speech is at
issue responds well to the fact that here
government is most likely to be biased. The
premise of distrust of government is strongest
when politics are at issue. It is far weaker
when government is regulating (say)
commercial speech, bribery, private libel, or obscenity.
In such cases there is less reason to suppose
that it is insulating itself from criticism.</p>
      <p>Finally, this approach protects speech when
regulation is most likely to be harmful.
Restrictions on political speech have the
distinctive feature of impairing the ordinary
channels for political change; such restrictions
are especially dangerous. If there are controls
on commercial advertising, it always remains
possible to argue that such controls should be
lifted. If the government bans violent
pornography, citizens can continue to argue against
the ban. But if the government forecloses

        <title>ACADEME July-Augus1t993</title>
        <p>problems. Indeed, controlling speech is, in
one sense, a defining characteristicof the
university. There are at least four different ways
in which such controls occur.</p>
        <p>First, universities impose major limits on
the topics that can be discussed in the
classroom. Subject matter restrictions are part of
education. Irrelevantdiscussion is banned.
Students cannot discuss the presidential
election, or Marx and Mill, if the subject is math.
Schools are allowed to impose subject matter
restrictions that would be plainly
unacceptable if enacted by states or localities.</p>
        <p>Second, a teacher can require students to
treat each other with at least a minimum of
basic respect. It would certainly be legitimate
to suspend a student for using consistently
abusive or profane language in the classroom.
This is so even if that language would receive
firm constitutional protection on the street
corner. The educational process requires at
least a measure of civility. Perhaps it would be
unacceptable for universities to ban
expressions of anger or intense feeling; the notion of
civility should not be a disguise for forbidding
irreverenceor disagreement. But so long as
requirements of civility are both reasonable and
neutral with respect to viewpoint, a university
may limit abusive or profane comments
within the classroom.</p>
        <p>The problem goes deeper, for- and this is
the third kind of academic control on
speech- judgments about quality are
pervasive. Such judgments affect admissions,
evaluation of students in class and on paper, and
evaluation of prospective and actual faculty as
well. Academic decisions about quality will of
course be based on a conception of
appropriate standards of argument and justification.
These standards involve judgments about
merit or excellence that would of course be
unacceptable in the setting of criminal
punishment or civil fine, but that are a perfectly
and nearly inescapable legitimate part of the
educational function. At least this is so if there
is no discrimination on the basis of viewpoint,
that is, if the person involved in making the
assessment offers judgments on the basis of
standards of quality that are applied neutrally
to everyone (an ambitious aspiration, and one
that is conceptually complex).</p>
        <p>But there is a fourth and more troublesome
way in which universities control speech, and
this involves the fact that many academic
judgments are viewpoint-based, certainly in
practice.In many places, a student who
defends fascism or communism is unlikely to
receive a good grade. In many economics
departments, sharp deviation from the views of
Adam Smith may well be punished. History
and literature departments have their own
conceptions of what sorts of arguments are
retrogradeor beyond the pale. Viewpoint
discrimination is undoubtedly present in
practice, and even if we object to it in principle, it
is impossible and perhaps undesirable for
outsiders to attempt to police it.</p>
        <p>Thus far I have mostly been discussing
students; but much the same is true for faculty
members. Universities can impose on their
faculty restrictive rules of decorum and civic
participation. A teacher who refuses to teach
the subject, fails to allow counter-arguments,
treats students contemptuously, or vilifies
them in class, can be penalized without
offense to the Constitution. The job
performance of teachers consists mostly of speech.
When that performance is found wanting, it
is almost always because of content, including
judgments about subject matter and quality,
and sometimes because of viewpoint.</p>
        <p>It is worthwhile pausing over this point.
Initial hirings, tenure, and promotion all
involve subject matter restrictions, and
sometimes viewpoint discrimination in practice.
All this suggests that universities are engaged
in regulating speech through content
discrimination and at least implicit viewpoint
discrimination. The evaluation of students and
colleagues cannot occur without resort to
con</p>

saying that it is hard for courts to police, but
nonetheless a real offense to both academic
aspirations and free speech principles.</p>
      <p>2. Educational requirementsand hate speech.
How does this proposition bear on the hate
speech issue? Perhaps a university could use its
frequently exercised power over speech in
order to argue for certain kinds of hate speech
codes. Perhaps it could say that when it
legitimately controls speech, it does so in order to
promote its educational mission, which
inevitably entails limits on who may say what.
Perhaps a university could be allowed to
conclude that its educational mission requires
unusually firm controls on hate speech, so as not
to compromise the values of education itself.</p>
      <p>The university might emphasize in this
regard that it has a special obligation to protect
all of its students as equal members of the
community. This obligation calls for
restrictions on what faculty members may say. The
university might believe that certain narrowly
defined forms of hate speech are highly
destructive to the students' chance to learn. It
might think that black students and women
can be effectively excluded by certain forms of
hate speech. Probably a university should be
given more leeway to restricthate speech than
a state or locality, precisely because it ought to
receive the beriefit of the doubt when it
invokes concerns of this kind. Surely the
educational mission ought to grant the university
somewhat greater room to maneuver,
especially in light of the complexity and delicacy
of the relevant policy questions. Courts might
also hesitate before finding viewpoint
discrimination or impermissible selectivity. Perhaps
there should be a presumption in favor of a
university'sjudgment that narrowlydefined
hate speech directed at blacks or women
produces harm that is especially threatening to
the educational enterprise.</p>
      <p>CONCLUSIONISBUTTRESSEDBY
two additional factors. First, there are
numerous colleges and universities.</p>
      <p>Many students can choose among a range of
alternatives, and a restriction in one, two, or
more imposes an extremely small incursion
into the system of free expression. Colleges
that restrict a large amount of speech may
find themselves with few students, and in any
case other institutions will be available.
Second, the Constitution is itself committed
to the elimination of second-class citizenship,
and this commitment makes it hard to say
that an educational judgment opposed to
certain forms of hate speech is impermissibly
partisan.</p>
      <p>3. Details. I think that an analysis of this
kind would justify two different sorts of
approaches to the issue of hate speech on
campus. First, a university might regulate hate
speech, narrowly defined, as simply a part of
its general class of restrictions on speech that
is incompatible with the educational mission.
On this approach, there would be no
restriction specifically directed against hate
speech</p>
      <p>no campus "speech code"- but a
general, suitably defined requirement of
decency and civility, and this requirement
would regulate hate speech as well as other
forms of abuse. Just as a university might ban
the use of profanity in class, or personally
abusive behavior on campus, so it might stop
racialepithets and similar expressions of
hatred or contempt. This is not to say that
students and teachers who violate this ban must
be expelled or suspended. Generally informal
sanctions, involving conversations rather than
punishment, are much to be preferred. But
the Constitution should not stand as a barrier
to approaches of this sort, so long as the
university is neutral in this way.</p>
      <p>Second, courts should allow narrowly
defined hate speech restrictions even if those
restrictions are not part of general proscriptions
on indecent or uncivil behavior. For example,
Stanford University now forbids speech that
amounts to "harassmentby personal
vilification." (Stanford is a private university, free
from constitutional restraint,but it has
chosen to comply with its understanding of what
the First Amendment means as applied to
public universities.) Under the Stanford rule,
speech qualifies as regulable "harassment"if it
(1) is intended to insult or stigmatize an
individual or a small number of individuals on the
basis of their sex, race, color, handicap,
religion, sexual orientation, or national and
ethnic origin, (2) is addressed directly to the
individual or individuals whom it insults or
stigmatizes, and (3) makes use of insulting or
"fighting"words or nonverbal symbols. To
qualify under (3), the speech must by its "very
utterance inflict injury or tend to incite to an
immediate breach of the peace," and must be
"commonly understood to convey direct and
visceral hatred and contempt for human
beings on the basis oP one of the grounds
enumerated in (2).</p>
      <p>The Stanford regulation should not be
faulted for excessive breadth. It is quite
narrowly defined. If a public university adopted
it, the major constitutional problem, fueled
by the outcome in R.A.K, would not be
breadth but unacceptable selectivity. Why has
the university not controlled other forms of
"fighting words," like the word "fascist,"or
"commie," or "bastard"?Does its selectivity
show an impermissible motivation? Shouldn't
we find its selectivity to be impermissibly
partisan?I do not think that we should. A
university could reasonablyand neutrally decide
that the harms caused by the regulated
fighting words are, at least in the university setting,
more severe than the harms caused by other
kinds of fighting words. I conclude that
public universities may regulate speech of the sort
controlled by the Stanford regulation and
probably go somewhat further, and that such
restrictionsshould not be invalidated as
impermissibly selective.</p>
      <p>We can also use this discussion as a basis for
exploring the question of the university's
power over employees, arising out of the
highly publicized decision of the City
University of New York to remove Dr. Leonard
Jeffries as chair of the black studies
department at City College. Jeffries had reportedly
made a range of apparently anti-Semitic
remarks, blaming rich Jews for the black slave
trade, complaining that Russian Jews and
"their financial partners, the Mafia, put
together a financial system of destruction of
black people," and claiming that Jews and
Italians had "planned, plotted, and
programmed out of Hollywood" to denigrate blacks in
films. Could the City University take these
remarks as a reason to remove Jeffries from his
position as department chair?(We should
agree that removal could be justified if, as
some say, it was a response to an inadequate
record of publication, to poor research,or to
low-quality work.)</p>
      <p>ANSWERDEPENDSON WHETHER
the removal was based on an effort
neutrally to promote educational
goals, or whether it was instead an effort to
punish the expression of a controversial point
of view. In the abstract this question is hard
to answer, but it can be clarified through

tried to do) a philosophy professor for
publishing the view that blacks are, on average,
intellectually inferior to whites. It also follows
that the City College could not remove
ProfessorJeffries from his tenured position
merely because of actually or
apparentlyantiSemitic statements.</p>
      <p>But we can imagine a range of statements
that might make job performance quite
difficult, at least for someone in a high-level
administrative position- statements, for
example, expressing general contempt for students
and colleagues, a refusal to participate in the
academic enterprise, or hatred directed against
people who are part of the university
community. Perhaps such statements would not be
sufficient to allow discharge from a faculty
position; but they could make it hard for the
relevant speakersto perform as deans, as
admissions officers, or as chairs of departments.
In the Jeffries case, the best argument in favor
of the City University of New York would be
that it is difficult for someone to succeed as
chair of a prominent black studies department
if he has made sharply derogatory statements
about members of other groups defined in
racial, religious, or ethnic terms. This
argument would not allow Jeffriesto be
discharged from his position as professor, but it
should allow him to be removed from the
position as department chair, which involves a
range of distinctive tasks. It follows that on
the facts I have assumed, the City College did
not violate Jeffries'sFirstAmendment rights.
Of course the case would be different if
Jeffries could prove that the City College was
reacting not to impaired job performance, but
to its own disapproval of Jeffries'spoint of
view.</p>
      <p>An opposing principle would take the
following form. A universityshouldnot
bepermitted to burdenor to deny benefitsto an employee
on the basisof the employeespoint of view, even
if thepoint of view doesdamagejob performance.
On this view, people who disapproveof the
point of view- students, other faculty,
potential contributors- should not be permitted to
enshrine their own views by affecting the
university'sdecisions about employees. We might
argue for this principle on the ground that
there should no "heckler'sveto" against
unpopular opinions. We should not have a
system in which people who dislike a certain
point of view can stop dissentersfrom
assuming prominent positions in the university.</p>
      <p>This argument is not without force, but I
do not think that it should be adopted.
Everyone seems to agree that the president
and the governor may make hiring decisions
on the basis of viewpoint; it would not make
sense to disable the president from ensuring
that high-level employees do not try, through
speech, to undermine the president's
program. Any resulting interference with the
system of free expression seems minimal, and the
president has a strong need for a loyal staff.
Similarly, universities have powerful and
legitimate reasons to expect their employees to
perform their jobs, especially if those
employees are engaged in highly public
administrative tasks, and especially if professorswho are
not performing administrative tasks are
realistically not threatened. At least under ordinary
circumstances, there will be no substantial
interferencewith the system of free expression if
universities are given the narrow authority for
which I have argued. I conclude that outside
of legitimate judgments about quality and
subject matter, universities may punish
employees for their speech only in a narrow set
of circumstances- almost always involving
highly public, administrative positions- in
which the relevant speech makes it difficult or
impossible for employees to perform their
jobs.</p>
      <p>It follows from all this that the national
government should abandon its efforts to
subject private universities to the constraints of
the First Amendment. This is an area in
which national authorities should proceed
with caution. Of course we could imagine
experiments that we might deplore. But there is
no reason for the federal government to
require uniformity on this complex matter.</p>
      <sec id="sec-8-1">
        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>A system of free expression should be
designed to safeguard the exchange of ideas.
This understanding calls for protection of
much of what might be considered "hate
speech";but it also allows restrictions on
speech that amounts to epithets. There are
some additional complexities in the academic
setting. Universities are pervasively and
necessarilyengaged in regulation of speech, and
this fact complicates many existing claims
about hate speech codes. In the end I suggest
that the test is whether the restriction on
speech is a legitimate part of the institution's
educational mission, understanding that ideal
by reference to the commitment to liberal
education. This mission is not neutral among
different conceptions of the good. It embodies
a substantive project (though the project is
one that allows exposure to a wide range of
competing conceptions). This understanding
would not permit speech codes to endanger
the exchange of ideas, but it would allow for
mildly broader restrictions than would be
acceptable for states and localities. &amp;
