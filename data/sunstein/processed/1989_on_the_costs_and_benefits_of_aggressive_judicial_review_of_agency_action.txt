ON  THE COSTS  AND  BENEFITS  OF
AGGRESSIVE  JUDICIAL  REVIEW  OF
AGENCY  ACTION

CASS  R.  SUNSTEIN*

In this  essay,  I undertake  three  tasks.  The  first is  to  describe  some
of the difficulties  of defining  "benefits"  in the setting of judicial  review  of
administrative  action.  The  second task is  to  offer  reasons,  though  tenta-
tive and largely  anecdotal  ones,  for an affirmative  answer to the  question
whether  aggressive  judicial  review  has  produced  "net  benefits."  At  the
very least, I  suggest,  aggressive  judicial review  has  had  significant bene-
fits  in many settings.  The third and  final  task is to  outline  some propos-
als  by  which  to  increase  the  benefits,  and  decrease  the  risks,  of  an
aggressive judicial  posture  in  administrative  law.

I.  THE  VARIOUS  "BENEFITS"  OF  JUDICIAL  REVIEW

For those assessing  the value of judicial review  of administrative  ac-
tion, the first problem is one of definition.  In this context, the criteria  for
evaluation are elusive,  and shift  dramatically  with context.  Even  so, it is
possible to identify at least four different  sets of criteria,  all of which have
been  invoked  in  recent  discussion.'

A.  Legality.

The  most obvious goal,  or "benefit,"  of judicial review  is to increase
the incidence  of legality.  Under this view, 2 judicial  review  of administra-
tive action is  necessary  above all  to ensure  that  regulatory  agencies  com-
ply  with  congressional  commands.  Far  from  being  an  enemy  of  the
democractic  process, judicial  review  is  its indispensable  ally,  since  it en-
sures administrative  fidelity to public desires  expressed in legislative com-
mands.  A major premise of this view is that implementing  agencies  have
an electoral  pedigree  inferior  to  that  of the  Congress-the  constitution-

ally  specified  institution  in  the design  of federal  law.3

If legality  is the goal  of judicial review,  active judicial review  might
well  be  desirable.  There  are  good  reasons  to  believe  that  courts  have  a
comparative  advantage  over  agencies  in  deciding  what  the law  is.4  But
an increase  in legality might not improve  social  welfare  by, any  measure.
A  statute  might be foolish,  for  example;  it might  impose  costs  that out-
weigh  any  benefits.  A  possible  example  is  the  Delaney  Clause,5  which
forbids  any carcinogens  in food additives.  The prohibition applies  to car-
cinogens  posing trivial  risks,  and  for that  reason  it  has  the potential  to
impose  costs-including  harms to  health resulting  from  the substitution
of noncarcinogenic  but risky substances  for carcinogenic  substances  pos-
ing  de minimis risks-that  would  dwarf  its benefits.6 '  A  court  that  re-
quired literal compliance with the Delaney  Clause might increase legality
but decrease  net  social  benefits.

B.  Efficient Resource Allocation.

Under  a  second  view,  the goal  of judicial review  is  to  promote  effi-
cient  resource  allocation.7  The  principal  concern  here  is  that regulatory

3.  For criticism  of this view,  see  Mashaw,  Prodelegation: Why Administrators Should Make
Political Decisions, 1 J.L.  EcON. & ORG.  81,  91-99  (1985)  (arguing for broad  statutory delegation  of
authority  to administrators).

4.  For a defense  of this  proposition,  see  Sunstein,  Constitutionalism After the New Deal, 101
HARV.  L.  REv.  421,  464-69  (1987);  for critical  discussion,  see  Diver, Statutory Interpretation in the
Administrative State,  133  U. PA.  L.  REv.  549,  582-92  (1985)  (favoring  interpretive  competence  of
agencies).

If the  goal  of judicial  review  is  to  promote  legality,  an  expansive  interpretation  of Chevron,
U.S.A.,  Inc.  v.  NRDC,  467  U.S.  837,  843  (1984)  (suggesting  that courts  should  defer  to  agency
interpretations  of law when  the statute is ambiguous  or when Congress  has  not  "directly  addressed
the precise question  at issue"),  would be  a serious mistake.  Courts could not  defer to congressional
interpretations  of ambiguous  constitutional  provisions  without grossly  distorting  basic principles  of
separation  of powers.  So too, judicial deference  to agency  views about  "pure"  questions of statutory
meaning  would  upset  longstanding  principles  to  the  effect  that  those  limited  by  legal  authority
should not be empowered  to decide on  the scope  of the limitation.  Foxes,  in short, should not  guard
henhouses.  See Sunstein,  supra, at  464-69.

One  might emphasize  this  point  while  at the  same  time  agreeing  that courts  should  defer  to
agency  views when Congress has  told them to do so,  or to agency  view.s on  questions, including  legal
questions,  that  call for  the  distinctive  factfinding  and  policymaking  competence  of the agency-a
point  that  supports  the  result in  Chevron  itself.  A  respect  for  the judicial  role  in  deciding  on  the
scope  of an  agency's  legal  authority,  for  the agency's  institutional  competence,  and  for Congress'
power  to allocate  interpretive  authority,  all  appear  to  underlie  the discussion  in  INS  v.  Cardoza-
Fonseca,  480  U.S.  421  (1987)-perhaps  the  most sensible  treatment  of these  issues in  the last  two
decades.

agencies  might  undertake  action  whose  real-world  benefits  are  exceeded
or even  dwarfed  by  their real-world  costs,  measured  in  economic terms.
In  these  circumstances,  judicial  review  might  serve  as  a  corrective.
Courts  might, for  example,  ensure  against  excessive  intervention  in  the
marketplace;  or  they  might  compel  agencies  to  consider  the  effects  of
private  conduct-for  example,  pollution-whose  extremely  high  social
costs  are insufficiently  taken  into  account  by the  marketplace.

If the goal of judicial review is efficient  resource  allocation,  that  goal
might be promoted  as a result of judicial invalidation  of agency action or
inaction  deemed  "arbitrary"  or  "capricious." '8  But judicial promotion  of
efficient resource  allocation  may or may  not overlap  with other beneficial
goals,  such  as  compliance  with a  statute  ("legality").  Statutory  require-
ments  sometimes  promote  the  goal  of  efficient  resource  allocation,  but
frequently  they  are  directed  toward  other  ends,  and  in  such  cases  the
promotion  of  legality  will  conflict  with  the  goal  of  efficient  resource
allocation.

C.  Real- World Improvements of an Eclectic Sort.

A third conception  of the purpose  of judicial review  also focuses  on
real-world improvements,  but selects a quite different  set of goals.  Under
this  view, 9 courts  should  not  only  promote  better  resource  allocation  in
an  economic sense,  but might also,  or  even alternatively,  attempt to:  (a)
ensure  a better distribution of wealth;  (b)  promote the various  nonmarket
or noncommodity  values  contained in statutes  that, for example, regulate
broadcasting  or  protect  endangered  species  and  the environment; 10  and
(c)  work  against  discrimination  directed  at  various  groups,  including
blacks,  women,  and  the handicapped.

On  this  view,  one  would  evaluate  judicial  review  by  asking  if it
brings  about  these  various  goals.  Net  benefits  would  be  found  when
courts sensibly promote  these goals;  net costs  would be found  if they  fail
to  do  so.  Here,  too, the connection  between  legality  in  the  sense  of ad-
herence  to  statute  and  real-world  improvements  is  uncertain  and  some-
times  merely  coincidental.  But  since  many  statutes  are  in  fact  designed
to  promote goals  of this sort, judicial  efforts  to  ensure fidelity  to law  will
often  also  result  in practical  changes  in  this  direction.

D.  Legitimacy.

Under the traditional  view, associated most closely  with the work  of
Kenneth  Culp  Davis  and  Louis  Jaffe,  the  basic  function  of the  courts
might  be described  as  the promotion  of  "legitimacy"  in  the administra-
tive  process.11  This  is  an  ill-defined  concept,  but  it  is  associated  with
such  conventional  notions  as  ensurance of legality,  protection  against ar-
bitrariness  and  selectivity,  promotion  of procedural  regularity,  and  en-
surance  against  the  twin  evils  of  factional  tyranny  and  self-interested
representation.  A  particular fear of this view  is  that well-organized  pri-
vate  groups  ("special  interests")  often  have  disproportionate  influence
over administrative  processes-a  phenomenon  that provides  the basic in-
sight  behind  the extensive  literature  on  agency  "capture." 12

This  view  places  great  emphasis  on  judicial  independence,  which
serves  as  an  important  safeguard,  providing  both  an  ex  ante  deterrent
and  as  an  ex  post  check  against  the  domination  of  administrative
processes  by  irrelevant  or  illegitimate  considerations.  On  this  view,
moreover,  an  aggressive  judicial  role  is  necessary  in  order to  introduce
some  of the traditional  virtues of Anglo-American  law  into the adminis-
trative process.  Here,  as  with the goal of legality,  the  "benefits"  of judi-
cial review  are not evaluated  directly  in terms of its consequences  for the
world.  The  goals  of judicial  review  are of a  more  diffuse  sort,  and have
no  necessary  or  linear  connection  with  good  regulatory  outcomes.

Both  critical  and  approving  evaluations  of the judicial  process  are
often  confused  by  a  failure  to  distinguish  among  these  various  criteria.
Thus,  for  example,  courts  have  been criticized  for adhering  to  statutory
text at society's  expense,  and  at the same time  for promoting  social  wel-
fare  at the expense of the statutory  text.1 3  Courts might  do  an excellent
job  of promoting fidelity  to  law,  but at the  same time,  and perhaps  as  a
direct  result,  bring  about  a  less  sensible  system  of regulation.  By  the
same token, courts  might introduce  necessary  regulatory  controls  but do
so  with a  weak  or uncertain  statutory  warrant.

In  assessing judicial  review,  then,  it  is  important  to  be  careful  to
spell out the  relevant criteria.  While  selection  of those criteria is  a value-

laden  task,  it is probably  fair  to say  that both  courts  and observers  have
paid less attention  than they should to the effects  of judicial review  on the
real  world of regulation--effects  that  are  crucial  to  an evaluation  of the
judicial  role.  It is  in large part because  of our considerable  ignorance  on
this  score  that  the  study  of  administrative  law  remains  in  a  primitive
state.

II.  THE  "NET  BENEFITS"  PRODUCED  BY  AGGRESSIVE

JUDICIAL  REVIEW

Whatever the relevant  criteria, it is  difficult to  make  confident  state-
ments  in  the abstract,  about the benefits  and costs  of aggressive  judicial
review  of administrative  action.  It is  surely  imaginable,  in certain  times
and places,  that aggressive judicial review  will both increase  illegality and
decrease  social  welfare  on  any view.  Indeed,  one  could  argue  that  this
was  precisely the pattern  in the period  immediately  before  and after  the
New Deal,  when  courts invoked  a principle calling  for narrow  construc-
tion  of regulatory  power. 14

More  recently,  aggressive  judicial  review  has  produced  regulatory
irrationality in a  variety  of areas.  Professor Mashaw  has  shown  that the
courts'  simultaneous  hospitality  toward  administrative  recalls  of defec-
tive vehicles  and  hostility  toward  ex  ante  motor  vehicle  regulation  have
pushed  automobile  safety regulation  in  peculiar  directions.  The  net  re-
sult  tends  toward  regulation  through  random,  ex  post  directives  rather
than  through  managerially  coherent,  ex  ante  controls.1 5  In  the  same
vein,  the  courts'  literal  approach  to  the  Delaney  Clause  has  increased
regulatory  irrationality  by  imposing  serious  costs  and  in  fact  bringing
about fewer  rather  than more  improvements  in  safety  and  health.' 6

On  the other hand, it is  fully imaginable  that aggressive judicial  re-
view will  both increase  legality  and improve  social  welfare.  Commenta-
tors can  invoke  considerations  at a high  level  of generality  that bear  on
this problem,  and indeed such considerations  form the staple of academic

14.  See,  eg.,  FTC v. Eastman  Kodak  Co.,  274  U.S.  619,  625  (1927)  (Commission had no  au-
thority to require company to divest labs acquired before action  by Commission);  FTC v. Gratz,  253
U.S.  421,  427 (1920)  (meaning of "unfair  method of competition"  is for the  courts, not the  Commis-
sion, to determine).  See generally Fordham & Leach, Interpretation of Statutes in Derogation of the
Common  Law,  3  VAND.  L.  REV.  438  (1950)  (noting  increasing  reliance  on  statutes  rather  than
common  law),  and  cases  cited  therein.

15.  See  Mashaw & Harsft, Regulation and Legal Culture:  The Case of Motor Vehicle Safety,  4
YALE  J. ON  REG.  257,  263  (1987)  (arguing  that judicial  review  is  a  cause  of National  Highway
Traffic  Safety  Administration's  shift from  rules  to  recalls).

16.  See, e-g.,'Public  Citizen  v. Young,  831  F.2d  1108,  1111-22  (D.C. Cir.  1987),  cert. denied,

listing decisions  for Orange  No. 17,  with cancer risk of I in  19 billion,  and  Red  No. 19,  with cancer
risk of I in  9 million,  must be changed).

debates  on  these  matters.  Judicial  lack  of accountability,  the judges'  ig-
norance  of the often  complex  matters  at hand, the  delays  and formality
built into  the litigation  process,  and the courts  ad hoc,  case-by-case  ap-
proach  to  regulatory  issues  are  certainly  likely  to  impair  judicial  per-
formance  in  overseeing  administration.' 7   At  the  same  time,  judicial
independence  might  serve  as  a protection  against  the various  pressures
that  produce  administrative  illegality,  injustice,  and  irrationality. 18  In
recent  years,  there  has  been  extensive  documentation  of  the  distorting
effects  of various  pressures  placed  on  regulators. 19  Such  evidence  pro-
vides at least a plausible  basis to believe  that courts, precisely because  of
their  independence,  will  provide  a  crucial  deterrent  and  ex  post
corrective.

20

Pitched  at  this  level  of generality,  however,  considerations  of this
sort are unlikely  to be conclusive.  Much  will depend  on context-on  the
particular substantive  area and on the incentives,  good  faith, and compe-
tence of judges  and administrators at any particular time.  An evaluation
of how  these  considerations  have  in  fact  played  out  over  the  past,  say,
fifty  years  must await  extensive  empirical  investigation.

Even in the absence  of a systematic  treatment, however, it is possible
to  point  to  reasons  to  believe  that  aggressive  judicial  review,  evaluated
under any criterion,  has been  desirable  in many  contexts.  Aggressive  re-
view serves  as a powerful  ex ante deterrent to lawless  or irrational  agency
behavior.  In  some  settings,  it  also  strengthens  both  analytic  processes
and accountability  to  superiors  within  agencies. 2 1  In  this sense, judicial
review  should be evaluated  in terms  of its systemic  consequences  for  the
administrative  process,  which  takes  place  in  the  shadow  of judicial  re-
view.  Those consequences  frequently  have  been  desirable,  above  all  be-
cause  of  the in  terroram  effect  of  the  prospect  of judicial  scrutiny.  A

the regulatory  programs  of the United  States  demonstrates  that judicial
decrees  are  important in  producing  executive  compliance  with  law. 22

It is  also possible  to  show  that  aggressive  judicial  review  has  often
provided  significant  benefits  both in  bringing  about  desirable  regulatory
initiatives and in preventing  unreasonable  or unlawful  regulation.  Exam-
ples are numerous,  and indeed  on balance  extraordinary.  Judicial  initia-
tives  helped  bring  about  regulation  of  DDT 23  and  airborne  lead 24;
control  of asbestos, beryllium,  and mercury 25; regulation  of atmospheric
loading,  which  produces  acid  deposition, 26  disclosure  requirements  for
hazardous chemicals 27; and regulation in the workplace  of ethylene  oxide
and  formaldehyde. 28  The  federal  courts  also  prevented  the  government
from eliminating passive restraint rules. 29  The Supreme  Court's invalida-
tion of an extremely  hasty and ill-considered  decision  to scrap those rules
will  ultimately  save  many  lives.  In  the  areas  of  communications  and
broadcasting,  an  aggressive judiciary has  helped ensure  high quality  pro-
gramming,  diversity,  local control,  and sensitivity  to the  interests  of mi-
nority groups.3 0  In  addition,  the Prevention  of Significant  Deterioration

Vol.  1989:522]  JUDICIAL REVIEW COSTS  AND  BENEFITS 

529

In  addition  to bringing  about  regulatory  initiatives  that  are  desira-
ble, courts have played  an important role in ensuring against overzealous
or  irrational  regulation.  Here  too,  the  aggregate  picture  is  quite  ex-
traordinary  and  reveals  judicial  protections  against  many  ill-considered
intrusions.  For  example,  courts  have  invalidated  an  indefensible  secon-
dary standard  for  sulfur dioxide; 32  struck  down  draconian  regulation  of
the automobile 33 and cement industries; 34 required a quite sensible show-
ing of a  "significant  risk"  before  OSHA  may  regulate  the workplace; 35
and invalidated  extremely  aggressive transportation  control plans written
by the  EPA.36

Examples  of this  sort  amount  to  little  more  than  anecdotes.  This
can  hardly  dispose  of the  issue.  But  they  are  highly  suggestive.  They
indicate  that a  world without aggressive judicial review  might well suffer
from  increases  in  lawlessness,  carelessness,  overzealous  regulatory  con-
trols,  and  inadequate  regulatory  protection.  Aggressive  judicial  review
has  produced  important  ex  ante  and  ex  post  benefits  in  numerous  set-
tings;  and  although  the  evidence  is  largely  anecdotal  and  far  from  sys-
tematic,  it  must  suffice  absent  a  more  sustained  investigation  into  the
issue.

III.  PROPOSED  PRINCIPLES  TO  INCREASE  "NET  BENEFITS"

We have  seen that it is difficult  to say in the abstract whether aggres-
sive judicial  review  of administrative  action  has  produced,  or  will  pro-
duce,  significant  advantages.  In these  circumstances,  a  major  task is  to
develop  principles of interpretation  that will  improve the situation.  Pub-
lic  law thus far lacks  a set of interpretive norms that are well-adapted  to
the purposes,  operation, and  occasional  failures  of regulatory  legislation.
For  this  reason,  the area  of statutory  construction  of administrative  be-
havior  remains undeveloped.  In this section,  I outline,  in summary  fash-
ion,  some  principles  that  courts  might  bring  to  bear  on  regulatory

problems. 37  Most of these  principles,  which  might be embodied  in  clear
statements  principles  or  interpretive  "canons,"  already  have  some  sup-
port in  existing  law.

A.  Proportionality.

Statutes  should be  construed so that the aggregate social  benefits  are
proportionate  to  the  aggregate  social  costs.  This  principle,  implicit  in
some of the recent cases, 38  recognizes  that a proportionality principle  will
likely  produce sensible regulation  and therefore  is the appropriate  under-
standing to  attribute to Congress under normal circumstances.  The prin-
ciple  also  recognizes  that  well-organized  groups  are  sometimes  able  to
obtain  legislation  that  would  not  be  the outcome  of a  well-functioning
deliberative  process;  that  bureaucratic  incentives  can  press  agencies  in
the direction  of overzealous  enforcement;  that  the statutory  text is some-
times an impulsive  reaction  to  short-term problems;  that  temporary pub-
lic  concern  can result in hasty  drafting;  and that  Congress  is not  able  to
focus  on  all applications  of statutory  standards.  The purpose of the pro-
portionality principle  is to ensure  that in the absence  of a clear legislative
statement,  statutes  are  understood  to  impose  costs  commensurate  with
their benefits.  Under  this view,  of course,  costs  and benefits  need not  be
measured  technically,  in  accordance  with  the  willingness-to-pay  crite-
rion,  but  instead  would  be  assessed  in  accordance  with  looser  under-
standings  about proportionality.

The proportionality  principle  has played  a role in two important  re-
cent  decisions.  In Industrial Union Department v.  American Petroleum
Institute, the  Supreme  Court  interpreted  the  toxic  substances  provision
of the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Act  to  require  a  showing  of  a
"significant  risk"  before  the Secretary  of Labor  can  regulate  toxic  sub-
stances.3 9  The plurality  referred  explicitly  to  the problem  of de minimis
health  benefits  imposed  for  huge  expense.40 
In  NRDC  v.  EPA,  the
United  States  Court of Appeals  for the  D.C.  Circuit  concluded  that  the
EPA could  take account  of economic and technological  feasibility  in  set-
ting  the  "margin  of  safety"  for  hazardous  pollutants. 4 1  Here  too  the
court  expressed  concern  that  an  alternative  interpretation  might  require

37.  A  much  more  detailed  treatment  of this  problem  can  be  found  in  a  forthcoming  article,
Sunstein, Interpreting Statutes in the Regulatory State, 103  HARV.  L. REv. (forthcoming  1989)  and a
forthcoming book,  C. SUNSTEIN,  THE REGULATORY  STATE (1989  draft).  Both deal  with numerous
interpretive  principles  with  which  to approach  regulatory  statutes.

38.  See, e.g.,  Industrial Union Dep't, 448  U.S. at 639-59;  NRDC  v.  EPA,  824  F.2d  1146  (D.C.

regulation that was irrational because it imposed enormous  costs for min-
imal  gains.42

Both  of these  decisions  can be understood  as  responsive  to  the fact
that stringent  statutory  requirements  tend  to  bring  about  a  paradoxical
regime of simultaneous  over-regulation  and under-regulation.  When  the
statute  does  not  contain  a  proportionality  principle,  agencies  tend  to
over-regulate  those substances  that get on the agenda;  but they are simul-
taneously  reluctant  to  regulate  many  substances  at  all,  which  therefore
go  entirely  uncontrolled.  One  consequence  of  draconian  standards  is
thus to  leave the marketplace  unregulated  in many  settings.43  A propor-
tionality principle  is  a useful  corrective.

B.  De Minimis Exceptions.

It  follows  from  the  proportionality  principle  that  administrators
should  generally be authorized  to refuse  to impose  costly regulations  for
highly  speculative  or  minimal  gains."4  Many  courts  have  reached  pre-
cisely this conclusion, holding that in the absence  of a clear congressional
statement, administrators  may make  de minimis exceptions  to  regulatory
controls.4 5  Indeed,  courts probably should require  such exceptions  in the
absence  of explicit  statutory text or plausible  substantive justifications  to
the contrary.

44.  Courts  have  reached  somewhat  conflicting conclusions  on  this point, although  the general
background  rule  seems  to be in  favor  of de minimis  exceptions.  See  Public  Citizen  v.  Young,  831

C.  Understanding Systemic  Effects.

Regulation  is  frequently  unsuccessful,  or  less  successful  than  it
should be, because  of a legislative or administrative  failure  to understand
the complex  systemic  effects  of governmental  controls.  The  problem  of
perverse unintended  consequences  is  a pervasive  one.4 6  A similar  failure
has  undermined  interpretive  efforts  by  the  federal  courts.  Consider,  for
example,  the court's  creation-in  the face  of an  ambiguous  text-of the
"prevention  of significant deterioration"  (PSD) program in Sierra Club v.
Ruckleshaus.4 7  In  that  case,  the court  ruled  that  state  implementation
plans  under  the  Clean  Air  Act 48  must  include  provisions  not  merely
complying  with  national  air quality  standards,  but  also designed  to  pre-
vent the degradation  of air currently cleaner  than  required by those stan-
dards.49  One  of  the  court's  apparent  goals  was  to  ensure  that  federal
environmental  policy  would  protect  visibility  in  currently  pristine  ar-
eas. 50  While  its  decision has  promoted  that  goal  to  some  degree,  it also
has  been  immensely  expensive,  has  delayed  the  substitution  of  low-
sulphur western coal for high-sulfur eastern  coal,  and has perversely  pro-
tected  dirty existing  plants  against replacement  with  cleaner  new  ones.5 1
It is  far  from  clear  that  the  environment  is  better  off  as  a  result.  The
Sierra Club  court  was  unaware  of these  effects.  Because  the  statutory
basis  for  the  decision  was  quite  thin,  an  understanding  of the  environ-
mental  and  nonenvironmental  costs  associated  with  the  PSD  program
might  well  have  led  to  a narrower  or  even  contrary  result.

Similar examples  are  provided by  the  Supreme  Court's OSHA  deci-
sions,  in which  the Court, or several  of its members,  appeared  to assume
that  greater  protection  for  workers  would  follow  automatically  from
more  stringent  statutory  requirements.5 2  As we  have  seen,  this  assump-
tion  disregards  the  fact  that  stringent  requirements  tend  to  lead  an
agency  not to  regulate  at  all,  thus  producing  under-regulation.  It also

ignores  the  risk  that  such  requirements  might  impose  costs  that  ulti-
mately  will be borne  by  workers  themselves.

In  short, courts  dealing  with regulatory issues  commonly misunder-
stand  the  systemic  effects  of  administrative  controls,  and  act  as  if the
decision will create only ex post winners  and losers in the particular case.
This misunderstanding leads to statutory construction  that is uninformed
by the real-world  impact of regulation-and  the real-world impact, while
not by  itself decisive,  is  frequently  relevant  to  the  question  of statutory
meaning.

D.  Cautious Approach to Legislative History.

Legislative  history  is  sometimes  written  by  one  or another  side in  a
dispute over the content of the law, and the history will sometimes reflect
a  view  whose  advocates  were unable  to  prevail  during  congressional  de-
liberations.5 3  Moreover,  Congress  enacts  laws,  not  the  comments  of
some  of its members  about  what  those  laws  mean.  All  this  supports  a
firm  principle  in  favor  of  the  priority  of  statutory  text  to  statutory
history.

Properly  understood,  this  principle  does not  call  on  courts to  disre-
gard the history, but counsels  them  to  give the history  limited weight  in
cases  of  arguable  conflict.  Consider,  for  example,  section  111  of  the
Clean Air Act,54 an ambiguous  provision that  could be interpreted to call
for  administrative  concentration  on  environmental  benefits,  but  whose
conference  report  language  suggests  an effort-unsuccessful  in  Congress
as  a  whole-to  convert  the  environmental  laws  into  protectionism  for
eastern  coal  producers.5 5  A court that accorded  great weight to  the his-
tory to  clarify  ambiguous  text might well  have  permitted  the conference
report to bring  about that conversion.  But a court  that accepted  the pri-
ority  of the  text would  interpret  it  to  ensure  against  a  statutory  "deal"
destructive  of both  the environment  and  the economy.

E.  Coordination.

It should  come  as  no  surprise  that the post-New  Deal proliferation
of regulatory  programs  has led  to inconsistency  and  sometimes  incoher-
ence  in  the  law.  For  example,  the  standards  for regulating  carcinogens

pretations of Law,  1989 DUKE  L.J. 510-12; see generally INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,  480 U.S.  421,  452-

language).

are notoriously  variable, calling  for excessive  controls  in  some areas  and
unduly weak  regulation in others.5 6  The absence  of centralization  has led
to  regulatory  failures  in  numerous  areas.57

A  partial  solution  would  call  on  courts  to  employ  clear  statement
principles  of statutory  construction  so  as  to help bring about consistency
and coordination  in the law.  A judicial role  of this sort  has  clear prece-
dent both in the old idea that statutes  governing  the same subject  matter
should be construed  together5 8  and  in contemporary  administrative  law.
In Bob Jones University v.  United States, for example, the  Supreme Court
held that the Internal  Revenue Service  could not  grant tax  deductions  to
private schools  that discriminate on the basis of race.5 9  The source of the
prohibition  was  a  statute giving  deductions  to institutions  serving  chari-
table  purposes,  but with an  implicit  exception  when  "public  policy"  re-
quires  denial  of the deduction.  There is no  doubt  that,  when  the  statute
was initially enacted,  "public policy"  did not prohibit deductions  to insti-
tutions  that  discriminated  on  the basis of race.  Racial  discrimination  in
education  was  common  at  the  time,  and  it  could  not  plausibly  be  sug-
gested  that  the  enacting  Congress  thought  that  discriminatory  schools
violated  public  policy.  The Bob Jones decision  is best  understood  as an
effort  to  ensure  that the  IRS  takes  account of the widespread  social  an-
tagonism  toward racial  discrimination,  since  that antagonism now  forms
a part of the general  thrust of contemporary  "public  policy."  The under-
lying  idea  was  that  the  statute  should  be  construed  in  a  way  that  con-
forms  to  current  views  about  racial  discrimination  in  education.  Some
cases  limiting agency  authority  to impose  significant  costs  for uncertain
or speculative benefits  can be understood in  similar terms,  as  an effort to
bring about coherence in the law and conformity with  current norms and
practices.60

F.  Obsolescence.

A large problem  for modem regulation is that of obsolescence-stat-
utory requirements  that are  inconsistent  with new  developments  of fact,
policy,  and  law.  Statutes  may no  longer  be  consistent  with widely  held
social  norms.  The legal background may  have changed  dramatically as  a
result  of judicial and legislative  innovations;  the factual assumptions  un-
derlying  an  old  statute  may  no  longer  hold.  In  all  of these  cases,  the
question 
in
interpretation.

is  whether  changing  circumstances 

justify  a  change 

In  the  areas  of  banking,  broadcasting,  and  carcinogen  regulation,
judicial interpretation  has  sometimes  been  a  straightforward response  to
changed  circumstances. 61  Here  it is implausible  to resolve  statutory  am-
biguities  by  asking  how  Congress  would  have  answered  the question  at
the  time  of enactment.  In light  of  the  changed  nature  of  the  relevant
markets,  such  an  approach  would  be  a recipe  for absurdity.  At  least if
the  language  so  permits,  there  is  no  alternative  but to  extrapolate  pur-
poses  at  a  certain  level  of generality  and  to  assess  the  changed  circum-
stances  in  light  of those  purposes.

Consider,  as  a  particular  example,  the  problem  of interpreting  the
Delaney Clause. 62  As was seen, the Clause contains  a general prohibition
on  the use of substances  that "induce"  cancer  as food additives,  and was
enacted  in a period when  carcinogens  could be detected  only at high-risk
levels.  The  enacting  Congress  assumed  that  carcinogenic  substances
were  both  rare  and  extremely  dangerous.  Now,  however,  carcinogenic
substances  appear  omnipresent,  and  often pose  little danger.  Should the
statute be interpreted to permit de minimis exceptions in a time in which
carcinogens  can  be  detected  at  exceptionally  low  levels  posing  trivial
risks  to  health?

The  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA), invoking  the  changed
character  of scientific  knowledge,  says yes;  a federal  court  has  said no. 63
In  the court's view,  the provision  said what  it meant  and meant  what  it
said, and that was that.  But read in its context, there was  no such clarity
in the Delaney  Clause.  Congress  simply  did not focus on the question  of
de minimis risks.  Indeed, it could not have done so in light of the state of
scientific  knowledge  with  respect  to  carcinogenic  substances.  It  was
therefore  a  myth  to  say  that  the  congressional  enactment  resolved  the

"risk free  workplace");  NRDC v. EPA,  824 F.2d  1146,  1164 (D.C.  Cir.  1986)  (restricting  EPA from
considering  cost  and  technical  feasibility  in determining  what  is  "safe").

The  question  is  the  meaning  of the  clause  in  light  of  the  new  circum-
stances.  Might the word  "induce"  contain  a de minimis exception?  The
answer  to  that question  will inevitably  depend  on  interpretation.

A  more  nuanced  approach  to  the  problem  of obsolescence  can  be
found in judicial constructions  of statutes  of the  1920s  and  1930s requir-
ing old-line  agencies  to  take  account of environmental  concerns. 64  Here
the legal background  has  changed  so  dramatically  that what  might seem
to  be a straightforward  interpretation  of the old  statutes  would  produce
incoherence.  The problem  of obsolescence  also helps  explain  the  courts'
narrow  construction  of  provisions  of  the  Uniform  Commercial  Code
(UCC)  that  had  not  anticipated  the  consumer  revolution  in  the  law  of
products  liability. 65

Dean  Calabresi  has  argued  that  courts  should  have  the  power  to
invalidate  obsolete  statutes,  returning them  to  the  legislature  for  recon-
sideration. 6 6  A judicial  role  of this  sort  would  be  extremely  controver-
sial,  and  properly  so.  The  principal  problem  posed  by  obsolescence  or
changed  circumstances  is  that  it  makes  interpretation  in  the  ordinary
sense  far  more  difficult.  Efforts  to  translate  statutes  into  new  settings
cannot  be  made  simply  by  asking  what  the  statute  meant  when  it  was
enacted.  A principle that calls for courts to exercise  some creativity  here
provides a far less intrusive function for the courts, and it has unmistaka-
ble foundations  in  current  law.

IV.  CONCLUSION

The  question  whether  aggressive  judicial  review  of administrative
action  has produced  "net  benefits"  poses  difficulty most  notably  because
of the  absence  of clear  criteria by  which  to make  the  assessment.  Courts
have  the  responsibility  both  to  ensure  legality  and  to  prevent  arbitrari-
ness,  and a decision to bring about compliance  with the governing statute
may or may  not produce  more sensible  regulation.  The absence  of clear
criteria  and the lack of good empirical  data make  it exceptionally  difficult
to evaluate  the strengths and weaknesses  of aggressive judicial review.  In
the abstract, one could  imagine  scenarios  in which  such review  would be

failure  to support decision  with sufficient  evidence in  the record  and for ignoring relevant factors  and
failing  to analyze  possible  alternatives  to  a hydroelectric  power plant  project).

alternatively  indispensable  and  disastrous.  Nonetheless,  there  is  some
basis  for believing  that aggressive  judicial  review  has,  in  many  settings,
increased  the  incidence  of  legality,  prevented  arbitrariness,  ensured
against  undesirable  regulation,  and  brought  about  regulatory  controls
that have  saved  lives  or  otherwise  accomplished  considerable  good.

A major  gap  in  current  administrative  law  is  the lack  of an  under-
standing  of the characteristic  functions and failures  of the regulatory pro-
cess,  and  a  derivative  understanding  of the judicial  role.  Sympathetic
engagement  with regulatory  purposes, together  with a  solid understand-
ing of regulatory  pathologies,  ultimately  might lead to  a set of principles
by which courts  could indeed bring about  "net benefits"  through judicial
review.  No  one  should  argue  that  the judiciary  should  play  the central
role  in  ensuring legality,  rationality,  or justice in  the administrative  pro-
cess.  But it would  be difficult  to  deny  that a judiciary  suitably  sensitive
to  the  functions  and  failures  of the  regulatory  state  might  well  make
things  better rather  than worse.
