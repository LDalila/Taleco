      <title>A. The Past</title>
      <p>Probably the most important development in administrative
law in the 1980s came not from federal courts, nor even from
Congress, but from Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
In two executive orders, President Reagan asserted vigorous
centralized control over the regulatory process. The first such
order, Executive Order 12291, laid out a set of substantive
principles, most notably cost-benefit analysis, and said that these
principles would be binding on executive agencies to the extent
permitted by law.' This Order also contained an important
procedural provision. It required all major regulations to be
accompanied by a "regulatory impact analysis," which would be submitted
for review and approval to the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs ("OIRA"), an institution within the Office of
Management and Budget ("OMB"). 2 The order amounted to an effort to
promote centralized OMB control of the regulatory process, to be
conducted in accordance with presidential policies favoring
deregulation and close attention to cost.</p>
      <p>President Reagan's second relevant executive order,
Executive Order 12498, went a step further. It required each agency to
submit an "annual regulatory plan," consisting of proposed
actions for the next year, that was to be included in a publicly
available annual document, the Regulatory Program of the
United States.3 Under this order, all agencies were required to
submit their proposals to OIRA for review and approval.4 New
initiatives not included in the annual plan were permitted only
under a narrow set of circumstances.5 The Order placed OIRA in
the center of regulatory planning.</p>
      <p>The Reagan initiatives were defended with several
theoretical and empirical arguments. National bureaucracies are
numerous, even chaotic, and regulations that are nominally
independent of one another may produce considerable inconsistency in
practice. Some degree of presidential review of the regulatory
process is probably necessary to promote political accountability
and to centralize and coordinate the regulatory process. These

are important goals, particularly in light of the need for sensible
priority setting in a nation that devotes extraordinary resources
to some minor problems and low levels of funding to some major
problems.'</p>
      <p>In addition, the cost of regulation-perhaps as high as $400
billion annually,7 with up to $124 billion spent on environmental
regulation alone--is too high for the benefits received.9 We
could obtain the same level of benefits far more cheaply. Perhaps
centralized presidential control could diminish some of the
characteristic pathologies of modern regulation-myopia,
interestgroup pressure, draconian responses to sensationalist anecdotes,
poor priority setting, and simple confusion. In theory, OMB
control promised to bring about not only greater political
accountability, but also more in the way of technocratic competence, thus
returning to the original New Deal goal of combining democratic
and technocratic virtues. ° Many people thought that the new
system of OMB oversight was admirably well suited to
overcoming the difficulties in the regulatory process."</p>
      <p>Despite these points, the Reagan orders were extremely
controversial. The criticisms fell into four basic categories:
1. Some people said that the orders involved an unlawful and
counterproductive transfer of authority from regulatory agencies
to OMB. This transfer of authority, it was said, disregarded the
cgoavmepathraetiPvereesixdpeenrttisneo opfotwheeragtoenbcriiensganabdovuitolaanteydstuhcehlatrwan,swfehric.h2
The transfer was especially controversial in light of the
perception that OMB would be unduly biased against regulation. 3
2. Some people complained that the process of regulatory
oversight was too secretive. In their view, the lack of public
visibility disguised a new system in which well-organized private
groups-particularly regulated industries-were allowed to
dictate national policy.'4 Especially during the period of Vice
President Quayle's Council on Competitiveness, some feared that
regulatory policy was being made by a "shadow government"
operating at the behest of private factions and accountable, in
practice, to no one with an adequate claim to public
legitima15
cy.</p>
      <p>3. Some people complained that the reviewing process
dwarfed OMB's limited resources and resulted in excessive delay.
The few officials at OIRA lacked the time and capacities to
engage in truly expert assessment of regulation and its complex
costs and benefits. Because OMB was unable effectively to assess
the wide range of regulations submitted to it, its principal
function was to slow things down. The result was to deprive the
public of desirable or necessary regulations and, on occasion, to
violate the law. 6</p>
      <p>4. Some people complained about the substantive principles
reflected in the Reagan orders. In their view, cost-benefit analysis
was too partisan a standard to capture the full array of
considerations properly invoked by regulatory agencies. In practice and
perhaps in principle, critics urged, the idea of cost-benefit
analysis was a device not for producing the right kind and amount of
regulation, but for diminishing the role of regulation even when
it was beneficial. This substantive agenda, it was said, violated

concluded that OMB delayed EPA regulations that were subject to statutory deadlines for
ninety-one days on average. EnvironmentalDefense Fund v Thomas, 627 F Supp 566, 571
(D DC 1986). Although § 8(a)(

review regulations "for which consideration or reconsideration under the terms of this
Order would conflict with deadlines imposed by statute or by judicial order," the court
concluded that this section of the Order was "simply ignored." Id at 570-71.

unjustified in light of the need for regulation in many areas of
modern life.'</p>

    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>B. The Present</title>
      <p>In light of the extraordinary importance of OMB oversight to
so much of American government, many observers were
extremely curious to see how President Clinton would reform the Reagan
initiatives. The process of reform was surprisingly slow. Whereas
President Reagan had issued the first of the two executive orders
within one week of assuming office, President Clinton did not
respond for many months. On September 30, 1993, however,
President Clinton issued his long-awaited repeal and replacement
of Executive Orders 12291 and 12498.18</p>
      <p>President Clinton's Order, Executive Order 12866, is a
dramatic and in many ways quite surprising step. First and in some
ways foremost, it maintains the basic process inaugurated by
President Reagan, including the essential procedural provision of
Executive Order 12291: the requirement that major regulations
be submitted to OMB for general review and oversight.'9 It also
includes the essential procedural provision of Executive Order
12498: the requirement that agencies submit an annual
regulatory plan, compiled in conjunction with OMB."</p>
      <p>At least equally important, Executive Order 12866 also
maintains much of the substantive focus of the Reagan orders,
including the emphasis on cost-benefit analysis as the basic
foundation of decision.2' President Clinton thus rejected the view
that an assessment of costs and benefits is an unhelpful or
unduly sectarian conception of the basis of regulation.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the Clinton Order marks a number of
important substantive and procedural shifts. Executive Order
12866 includes a set of innovations specifically designed to
overcome the problems faced in the Reagan and Bush
administrations. In particular, it addresses unnecessary conflicts between
agencies and OMB, and the appearance (or perhaps the reality)
of factional influence over the review processY It also places the
Vice President squarely in charge of the regulatory processY It
reduces the number of rules that OMB will review, perhaps by as
much as one-half. It seeks to overcome the "ossification" of rule
making, in part by encouraging negotiated rule making.'</p>
      <p>The Order also includes a new, complex, and somewhat
unruly set of substantive principles to govern agency decisions.
Some of these principles are an outgrowth of the commitment to
"reinventing government" in the service of more flexible
management.' Some of them qualify the commitment to cost-benefit
analysis, though in ambiguous ways. Some of them point in the
direction of comparative risk assessment." Apart from their
merits as policy reforms, some of these innovations are of
uncertain legality.</p>

      <title>C. The Plan</title>
      <p>This Article evaluates Executive Order 12866 as part of
President Clinton's program for "reinventing government." We do
this in an effort to help point the way toward procedural and
substantive reforms that might increase coordination and
rationality in federal regulation, and in this way diminish currently
excessive costs, while at the same time promoting the democratic
character of regulatory processes through methods that will take
advantage of appropriately informed public judgments about risk.</p>
      <p>To introduce some of our themes in advance: The modern
regulatory state delivers insufficient benefits at unnecessarily
high costs. A range of imaginable improvements could decrease

the costs of regulation and thus reduce prices, increase
employment, and promote international competitiveness. Through such
steps, reduced costs could also reduce poverty and thus risks to
life and health." Through similar steps, reforms could reallocate
regulatory resources to places where they will do the most good.
In this way, regulatory programs could deliver greater protection
of safety and health and, in the process, save many lives.</p>
      <p>The modem regulatory state should also be more democratic.
Currently, regulation is far too inaccessible to public control.
Instead, it is enshrouded in technocratic complexities not subject
to public debate, affected by misleading, sensationalist anecdotes,
or, even worse, subject to the influence of well-organized private
groups with personal stakes in the outcome. A range of
improvements could make the democratic process work better. The key
task for those interested in regulatory performance is to find
ways of simultaneously promoting economic and democratic
goals.'</p>
      <p>We offer a range of proposals designed to accomplish this
task. A special goal is to incorporate public judgments about risk
so long as they are appropriately informed and reasonable, even
when those judgments diverge from expert understandings. We
spend considerable space on this complex subject, contending
that public judgments often reflect a distinctive kind of
rationality, one that rejects some conventional forms of cost-benefit
balancing. Executive Order 12866 might well be administered in a
way that takes advantage of this insight. In short, we offer the
following recommendations:</p>
      <p>1. OIRA should see, as one of its principal missions, the goal
of rationalizing regulatory policy by ensuring good priority
setting, comparison of risks in terms of seriousness, and careful
attention to the most important problems. To this end, it should
issue guidelines and recommendations for the best use of limited</p>

Pub Health 1148 (1991); Ralph L. Keeney, MortalityRisks Induced by Economic
Expenditures, 10 Risk Analysis 147 (1990); Aaron Wildavsky, Searchingfor Safety 61-75
(Transaction, 1988).</p>
      <p>'8 It is too soon for any real conclusions about the actual implementation ofExecutive
Order 12866. We note, however, that the first major report on the Order was concerned
almost exclusively with procedural issues of internal governmental management; it said
nothing about whether the Order was actually making for better or worse regulation. See
Office of Management and Budget, Report on Executive Order No 12866, Regulatory
Planning and Review, 59 Fed Reg 24276 (1994). There appears to be a risk that OIRA will
be unduly concerned with procedural issues and fail to focus on what is most important,
the substance of regulation.
public and private resources, together with information about the
concrete, actual consequences of current efforts and about ways
of improving them.' The ultimate goal should be neither to stop
nor to spur regulation, but instead to make sure that regulation
works well.</p>
      <p>2. There should be early coordination between OIRA and
other federal officials, based on shared goals and on a clear
understanding ofjurisdictional lines. OIRA should not operate as a
last-minute obstacle to agency proposals.</p>
      <p>3. OIRA should allow a form of "national performance
review" in which it demonstrates in concrete terms how, and at
what cost, regulation under its supervision has promoted
particular social goals. To this end, OIRA should publicize its
shortterm and long-term goals for regulation in relatively concrete
terms and show whether and how the government has made
progress in meeting those goals. It should do this as part of a
general effort to encourage public trust and public understanding
of regulatory outcomes and choices. It should also attempt to
promote, to the extent feasible, citizen participation in the
process of setting regulatory priorities.</p>
      <p>4. Regulations should be evaluated not only in terms of
aggregate costs and benefits, but also in terms that reflect
democratic judgments about qualitative differences among
qualitatively different risks. By qualitative differences, we mean
to include an understanding of whether a risk is voluntarily
incurred, especially dreaded, equitably distributed, potentially
irreversible or catastrophic, faced by future generations, or
incurred by discrete groups within the population. To incorporate
an understanding of these factors, OIRA and relevant agencies
might experiment with three approaches: (a) develop formulas
that assign numbers to, and thus incorporate, qualitative
differences; (b) offer a two-stage analytic process, the first based on
conventional cost-benefit balancing, the second introducing
qualitative differences in order to produce a final judgment; and (c)
use different forms of citizen participation so as to build into the
regulatory process an understanding of informed public
judg</p>
      <p>Many proposals in Congress suggest this approach by requiring comparative risk
assessment. See the Johnston Amendment, S 171 § 123, 103d Cong, 1st Sess (May 4,
1993), in 139 Cong Rec S5362 (May 4, 1993). See also the important discussion of
"riskrisk" trade-offs in John Graham and Jonathan Wiener, Risk vs. Risk (Harvard,
forthcoming 1995).
ments about how different risks should be treated. We offer
comments on all three proposals below. 0</p>
      <p>5. The government should shift from command-and-control
regulation to more experimentation with information disclosure
as a remedy for risk and with economic incentives. Informational
remedies should be based on a careful understanding of how
people process information and develop trust, a key ingredient of
successful risk communication. If methods ofinformation
processing are not kept in view, informational remedies can be futile or
even counterproductive. Moreover, the use of incentives should be
limited to certain specific circumstances that we identify.</p>
      <p>6. The President or the Vice President must take a serious
interest in improving health and safety regulation. Without a
firm signal from the highest levels of government, OIRA is
unlikely to be able to accomplish much of its mission, and the
potential advantages of centralized control will be lost.</p>
      <p>This Article is organized into five parts. Part I describes the
history of presidential oversight of the regulatory process,
showing that such oversight has been a steady development in the
twentieth century and that it can now be said to be permanent,
or at least as permanent as any procedural innovation not
required by the Constitution itself. Part H deals with institutional
issues, in particular with those procedures designed to bring
about greater openness and visibility. This self-conscious effort at
democratization is one of the most distinctive features of
Executive Order 12866. Part II also discusses the fact that the Order
contains an apparent presidential (and vice-presidential) veto on
agency regulations-a bold step that goes well beyond anything
that Presidents Reagan or Bush endorsed, at least publicly. It
concludes with a discussion of the Order's partial and
unprecedented inclusion of the independent regulatory commissions.</p>
      <p>Parts III, IV, and V are the heart of the Article. Part III
turns to substance and, in particular, to the question of
regulatory ends. It focuses on cost-benefit analysis, comparative risk
assessment, and the problem of regulatory rationality in general.
There is good reason for enthusiasm about some basic goals and
possibilities of these technologies-to increase sensible priority
setting, to limit the unnecessarily high costs of regulation, and to
make sure that government controls actually improve people's
lives. But it is important to ensure a form of these analytic
techSee Part IV.F.
niques that is attuned to some of the complexities of social
valuation of different risks in different contexts of social life.</p>
      <p>Part IV offers a number of suggestions on this score. It tries
to make sense of the evident ambivalence in Executive Order
12866 toward cost-benefit analysis. We suggest that there are
conceptions of rationality that resist the effort to align diverse
social goods along a single metric, and that cost-benefit analysis
disregards what we call the expressive dimension of regulation.
Part IV also urges possible modifications to conventional
costbenefit analysis, designed specifically to make a place for
adequately informed and rational public judgments about risks.</p>
      <p>Part V discusses the question of regulatory means. Its
principal topic is the conspicuous effort in Executive Order 12866 to go
beyond command-and-control regulation in the interest of
providing less costly means for achieving regulatory goals. Here we
emphasize an unmistakable trend in federal regulation:
information disclosure as a remedy for risk. We also deal with the
replacement of command-and-control approaches with economic
incentives. We discuss the ways in which new strategies should
take account of ordinary understandings of risk and also attempt
to build public trust. Through this discussion of means, as
through the earlier discussion of ends, we suggest reforms that
will simultaneously promote economic and democratic goals.</p>
      <p>I. BACKGROUND: A NEW AND PROBABLY PERMANENT FEATURE</p>
      <p>OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT</p>
      <p>Almost since the birth of the modern administrative agency,
American presidents have struggled to assert more centralized
control over the regulatory state. Indeed, a recent study asserts
that "the history of the presidency in the twentieth century has
been the history of presidents' attempts to gain control of the
sprawling federal bureaucracy."3' Typically, these attempts have
generated sharp congressional resistance.</p>
      <p>The first step in this direction can probably be traced to
President Theodore Roosevelt's creation, in 1903, of a commission
designed to study the scientific work done by government
agencies in order to recommend more efficient coordination. The
results presaged those of similar reform efforts to follow. The
commission recommended that the thirty scientific agencies be

1994).
solidated into one, in order to minimize duplication and
inefficwiehnicchy.deRcolionseedvetlot afcotrwonardite.3d2 this recommendation to Congress,</p>
      <p>Roosevelt then created a second commission, the Keep
Commission, to study a broader array of administrative reforms. In
some ways a precursor of Vice President Gore's recent National
Performance Review, the Keep Commission found that many civil
servants were underemployed and resistant to new technologies,
such as typewriters and adding machines. It also concluded that
the system of supply acquisition was hopelessly chaotic. 3 The
Keep Commission forwarded eleven formal reform proposals to
Congress. When it did so, the century's first major battle between
Congress and the White House over control of administration
was joined. Congress not only declined to act on any of the
proposals, but also expressed outrage at the Executive's effort to
seize "an authority previously the exclusive and unchallenged
domain of Congress."' In addition, Congress prohibited the use
of government funds for such commissions in the future and even
refused to appropriate funds to publish the Keep Commission's
report.35</p>
      <p>At Congress's invitation, President Taft attempted to
centralize and coordinate the budgetary process. Although Congress
rejected Taft's particular proposals, by 1921 Congress granted the
President effective oversight control of agency fiscal requests by
enacting the Budget and Accounting Act.38 This was an
extraordinary development, in many ways a precursor of current efforts
to centralize the regulatory process. For the first time, the
President would be given statutory authority to submit an annual
budget to Congress. Wilson's wartime presidency aggressively set
into motion the vision of a more managerial presidency.37</p>
      <p>In the period after the war, the ideas of consolidation and
efficiency-motivated reorganization swept the business
community. Congress eventually followed suit in 1932 with the
Government Reorganization Act,38 which granted the President
unilateral authority, subject to legislative veto,39 to reorganize the
administrative branch. Franklin Roosevelt's Brownlow Commission
revived Wilson's famous distinction between policy and
administration;' the Commission saw "policy" as the joint domain of the
President and Congress, whereas "administration," it asserted,
must be under the direct and exclusive command of the
President. Despite an initial congressional outcry, most of the
Committee's proposals were enacted.4 A key reform, with
lasting consequences, was the creation of the Executive Office of the
President.'</p>
      <p>In 1949, the Hoover Commission produced yet another effort
to create a more coordinated and managerial presidency. It
issued 277 specific proposals for reorganizing and consolidating
agencies. More than half of these were adopted via statute or
executive order, with the purpose of creating a "clear line of
command from the top to the bottom, and a return line of
responsibility and accountability from the bottom to the top."43</p>
      <p>The most direct precursor to the current structure of
executive oversight of regulation was the Nixon Administration's
system of "Quality of Life" reviews. Nixon's response to the
expanding administrative bureaucracy was to create a
"counter-bureaucracy" in the White House. He doubled the executive office staff,
created the modern OMB, and established the Domestic Council
(chaired by a top aide, John Ehrlichman). The Council met with
representatives of different departments having jurisdiction over
a problem and tried to develop coordinated policy positions for
presidential approval.' In the "Quality of Life" review process,
agencies were required to submit significant rules to OMB in
advance of publication in the Federal Register. OMB's principal
duty was to circulate the agency draft to other agencies for
review and comment. Although the process was intended to apply

to all agencies, only EPA and OSHA were actually subject to the
reviewing process. OMB's goal was rarely substantive; it served
instead a coordinating function.45</p>
      <p>President Ford continued the interagency review process and
added to it a process designed to control the effects of regulation
on inflation. Most important, the Council on Wage and Price
Stability ("CWPS") reviewed regulations to assess these effects.
In addition,- OMB promulgated a circular to agencies arguing
that the inflationary impact of a proposed rule could best be
assessed through a quantitative cost-benefit comparison." The
Council's role was principally technical, consultative, and
advisory. It was understood that the relevant agency might well persist
in the face of CWPS disagreement. Despite often antagonistic
relationships between the agencies and CWPS, many observers
believed that CWPS enhanced both public participation and the
agencies' analytical capabilities.' Congress ultimately enacted a
statute allowing CWPS to participate in rule making and to
explore adverse effects on inflation.48</p>
      <p>President Carter,built on the Ford precedent through a
successor to CWPS, the Regulatory Analysis Review Group
("RARG"). RARG consisted of representatives from major
agencies, OMB, CWPS, and the Council of Economic Advisors. The
purpose of this fifteen-agency group was to conduct interagency
review of cost-effectiveness analyses, which were required of
"significant" rules from relevant agencies. Notably, the Executive
Order establishing the RARG review process did not require
costbenefit analysis.49 In fact RARG reviewed relatively few rules,
though the President did resolve a few highly controversial
issues.</p>
      <p>
        All of these efforts were designed to increase interagency
dialogue, coordination, and analytical precision, as well as to
reduce regulatory costs. But a decisive step came within a week
of President Reagan's inauguration, with the formal creation of a
mechanism for OMB review of major regulations. The most
important of the new innovations, contained in Executive Order
12291, were (1) a set of substantive principles for all agencies to
follow, "to the extent permitted by law," including a commitment
to cost-benefit analysis; (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">2</xref>
        ) a requirement that a Regulatory
Impact Analysis, including a cost-benefit analysis, accompany all
"major" rules; and (3) a formal mechanism for OMB oversight,
with a general understanding that OMB had some (undefined)
substantive control. President Reagan considered subjecting the
independent agencies to the new Order, but ultimately declined
to do so, partly because of concerns about legal authority, but
mostly because of fears of an adverse congressional reaction.50
The independent agencies were asked voluntarily to comply with
Executive Order 12291, but not one of them formally
acknowledged their willingness to do so.
      </p>
      <p>Executive Order 12291 proved extremely controversial.
Nonetheless, President Reagan expanded on the basic idea four years
later with Executive Order 12498. As noted above, that Order
established a requirement that agencies submit "annual
regulatory plans" to OMB for review.5 The result is an annual
publication, the Regulatory Program of the United States, which
contains a discussion of all proposed actions that might be either
costly or controversial. Executive Order 12498 served to increase
the authority of agency heads over their staffs by exposing
proposals to top-level review at an early stage. But it also increased
the authority of OMB by allowing OMB supervision over basic
plans and by making it hard for agencies to proceed without
OMB preclearance.</p>
      <p>The Bush Administration continued the Reagan procedures.
Its principal innovation was the Council on Competitiveness,
chaired by the Vice President. The Council engaged in occasional
review of agency rules, operating as a kind of supervisor of OMB
itself. It also set out a number of principles and proposals for
regulatory reform."</p>
      <p>President Clinton's Executive Order 12866 is the latest step
in this process; we will investigate it shortly. Our current point is
more general. From the recent evidence, it seems clear that
presidential oversight of the regulatory process, though relatively new,
has become a permanent part of the institutional design of
American government. This new institutional arrangement has
occurred for reasons parallel to the development of a centralized

budget in the 1920s. Any president is likely to seek assurance
that an unwieldy federal bureaucracy conforms its actions to his
or her basic principles. Any president is likely to be concerned
about excessive public and private costs. And any president is
likely to want to be able to coordinate agency activity so as to
ensure consistency and coherence and to guard against the
imposition of conflicting duties on people who must comply with the
law. The result of these forces is that a centralizing and
rationalizing body, housed within OMB and devoted to regulation, has
emerged as an enduring, major, but insufficiently appreciated
part of the national government.</p>

      <title>II. REGULATORY INSTITUTIONS</title>
      <p>Executive Order 12866 makes three major institutional
changes from the Reagan-Bush procedures. It imposes new
disclosure requirements. It attempts to sort out the allocation of
authority among agencies, the White House, and OIRA. Finally,
it includes the independent agencies within some aspects of
presidential oversight.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-8">
      <title>A. In General</title>
      <p>As we have said, there are strong reasons for creating and
maintaining an executive office entrusted with the job of
coordinating modern regulation, promoting sensible priority setting,
and ensuring conformity with the President's basic mission.53 In
view of the wide array of regulatory programs administered by
modern government, the absence of such an office would probably
guarantee duplication, parochial perspectives, and inefficiency. A
number of separate agencies and programs deal with
environmental and other risks, and it is therefore important to share
information, to reduce inconsistency, and to devote scarce
resources to places where they will do the most good.</p>
      <p>The past process of OIRA review has been imperfectly
equipped to carry out these tasks. Too often OIRA has become
involved at very late stages, operating as a kind of last-minute
barrier to action at a point when cooperation and trust are nearly
impossible." Too often relations between OIRA and the agencies
have been adversarial, with considerable distrust and even a

degree of "guerilla warfare."55 What is needed instead is a
definition of shared goals and objectives, accompanied by good and
continuous working relations, clear jurisdictional authority, and
mutual investment in the basic goals of improving regulatory
performance according to agreed-upon criteria.</p>
      <p>Executive Order 12866 is designed in part to achieve these
goals, though some of the evidence for this conclusion lies outside
the four corners of the document. The Order establishes the
agencies as the principal decision makers, and in this way it
insists, more than its predecessors, on agency autonomy." In
general, the process appears to involve a government-wide
system of priority setting, rather than one concentrated in OMB.
Thus the Order contemplates an annual agency policy meeting to
set priorities and coordinate activities. 7 The Order also requires
each agency head to designate a Regulatory Policy Officer, who is
to be involved "at each stage of the regulatory process."8</p>
      <p>Following this provision, the Clinton Administration has
created a set of Regulatory Policy Officers within each agency.59
These officers are specifically charged with improving the
regulatory process by ensuring conformity with Executive Order 12866.
The officers work with a new Regulatory Working Group created
by the Order, chaired by the OIRA Administrator, and attended
by specially appointed White House Regulatory Policy
Advisors.60 The purpose of this system is to promote early interaction
and cooperation by coordinating agency and OIRA behavior, and
also to ensure exchange of information among agencies, with a
particular eye toward sensible treatment of problems that cut
across agencies.6 In a similar attempt to limit conflicts and to
reduce unnecessary layers of bureaucratic oversight, Executive
Order 12866 also attempts to reduce the number of rules to be
reviewed by OIRA, cutting the number in half from previous
years. 2 The Order seeks to promote democratization as well by

requiring the OIRA Administrator to meet with members of the
public and to convene conferences to this end.'</p>
      <p>It is impossible to tell at this stage whether these
institutional innovations will accomplish a great deal. Much of the
evidence will come from the regulations that eventually emerge. If
cooperation is an end in itself, it is a limited one, and the success
of the new process will be measured principally by
substance-what emerges from it. Two early reasons for concern are
the apparent absence of clear OIRA focus on regulatory
consequences, and the apparent failure to develop a close sense of
regulatory priorities through general publicity about the nature
of various risks and the costs of eliminating them.Y It would be
highly desirable for OIRA to attempt to place problems in broad
risk categories and to attempt to regulate risks that are of the
highest priority.' For democratic reasons, it would also be
desirable for OIRA to make information about risk categories
broadly available to the public and to be responsive to the weight
that the public places on various risks. The EPA undertook an
early effort to this effect and updated it in 1990.' The 1990
study identified a number of "relatively high-risk problems,"
including habitat alteration and destruction, species extinction
and loss of biological diversity, ozone depletion, and global
climate change. It also found a number of "relatively medium-risk
problems," including pesticides, surface water toxins, acid
deposition, and airborne toxins. And it identified a number of
"relatively low-risk" problems, including oil spills, radionuclides,
groundwater pollution, and thermal pollution.' A 1994 report of the
National Academy of Sciences basically approved the EPA's
ranking and approach.' This might serve as a model for the federal
government as a whole.</p>
      <p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it would be desirable
for the executive branch to identify its long-term risk-reduction
goals, at least in broad terms, and to report on its progress
toward reaching those goals. Executive Order 12866 contains no
mechanism of this kind.</p>
      <p>In general, however, there is reason for optimism both in the
maintenance of the OIRA reviewing process and in the steps to
limit antagonism between the agencies and OIRA and to promote
attention to shared regulatory goals. We now turn to some
institutional details.</p>

    <sec id="sec-9">
      <title>B. Disclosure Requirements</title>
      <p>The Reagan orders contained no provisions governing
disclosure or regulation of communications between private parties
and OIRA, or within the executive branch itself. The absence of
formal procedures was itself a cause of considerable
controversy.69 Many people alleged that private communications had
occurred and that OIRA was basing its decisions on pressure from
business groups with self-interested stakes in the outcome.7"</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-10">
      <title>1. Policy and law.</title>
      <p>As a matter of policy, the rules governing disclosure of
communications with OIRA are quite important. Informal
communications between the executive branch and affected citizens may
be "the lifeblood of the administrative process,"7 in the sense
that they may well be crucial to the development of sound

      <p>See text accompanying notes 14-15.</p>
      <p>70 See Olson, 4 Va J Nat Resources L at 31-35 (cited in note 14); Percival, 54 L &amp;
Contemp Probs at 168-72 (cited in note 17). Early in the Reagan administration, the
Department of Justice advised OMB to make public all substantive communications between
OMB and private parties. See Stephen G. Breyer and Richard B. Stewart, Administrative
Law and Regulatory Policy 684 (Little, Brown, 3d ed 1992), summarizing Memorandum
from Larry Simms, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, to
Director of the Office of Management and Budget (1981). An implementing memorandum from
OIRA offered a complex set of guidelines. See Memorandum, Additional Procedures
Concerning QIRA Reviews Under Executive OrderNos 12291 and 12498, from Wendy L.
Gramm, Administrator, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, published in Office
of Management and Budget, Regulatory Programof the United States Government,April
1, 1990-March 31, 1991 605 (US GPO, 1990). Congress held many hearings about the
absence of disclosure of communications between OIRA and private groups, or between
OIRA and the agency itself. See Clean Air Act Implementation (Part 2): Hearings before
the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the House Committee on Energy
and Commerce, 102d Cong, 1st &amp; 2d Sess (1991-92). Informal agreements were reached
between the White House and Congress, without formal legislation, requiring disclosure of
most substantive communications from private parties. The understandings are published
in the Congressional Record. See 136 Cong Rec S17608-10 (Oct 27, 1990). They did not,
however, cover the Council on Competitiveness, which became the focal point of concern.

sue. Perhaps those background beliefs are already understood. If
they are not, interviews can be helpful, but structured
questionnaires might be used where the former are not feasible. The
process of eliciting views should be at least somewhat open
ended; investigators should not force the process into predetermined
channels. The process might start with questions like "tell me
about radon" and seek elaboration of the responses. Studies of
different risk problems suggest that after twelve interviews or so,
few new concepts emerge in the answers."o</p>
      <p>Second, initial material should be designed to provide the
relevant information in a way that responds to those background
beliefs. To the extent that the elicitation process reveals gaps and
errors in these beliefs, the material should address them. In
addition, rather than providing bare information, the material
should provide it in a form directed to taking action. Third, the
initial material should be tested empirically with potential users.
Iterations of this process yield the most effective forms of
information disclosure.</p>
      <p>Applying this approach in 1987, experts were able to
generate a highly effective brochure for addressing the radon problem,
a brochure that was far more effective than the widely
distributed EPA brochure on that topic. The elicitation process revealed
that, in addition to holding many accurate beliefs about radon
exposure, people also held many inaccurate beliefs: that radon
contamination of surfaces is permanent (39 percent); that radon
affects plants (58 percent); that it contaminates blood (38
percent); and that it causes breast cancer (29 percent).38' Few
people understood that radon decays quickly (13 percent).382 The
combination of some of these beliefs would make the radon
problem seem severe and unsolvable; consider the lack of knowledge
of the fact that radon decays quickly.</p>
      <p>On the basis of this information, brochures were designed
that specifically addressed the flaws and gaps in people's
background beliefs. The unsuccessful EPA brochure had been
prepared through traditional methods; scientific experts were asked
what information was relevant and it was then packaged
attractively. The initial version of EPA's "Citizen's Guide to Radon," for
example, did not discuss whether radon contamination is
perma</p>
      <p>Id at 2052.</p>

nent. When empirically tested, this EPA brochure performed
significantly worse than the brochures prepared through the
alternative method. When people were asked to recall simple
facts, they did equally well with all the brochures. But when
faced with tasks requiring inference, the new brochures
"dramatically outperformed" the EPA material.' For example, when
asked what a homeowner could do to reduce high radon levels in
the house, 43 percent of EPA readers answered "don't know" and
9 percent said "there is no way to fix the problem." In contrast,
100 percent of the readers of the brochure designed on the basis
of risk communication studies, and 96 percent of the readers of
another, answered "hire a contractor to fix the problem."384</p>
      <p>This approach stands in sharp contrast to that reflected in
one of the most carefully prepared and broadly circulated
manuals on risk information and its communication. This manual,
produced for the Chemical Manufacturers Association, sought to
provide advice to plant managers on the most effective means to
make public comparisons between different kinds of risks. The
chemical industry drew on literature concerning effective
communication, but it did not test its manual empirically. When that
was done, it turned out that the advice was flatly wrong. There
was no correlation between actual public assessments of the risks
and those the manual predicted.385</p>
      <p>Informational remedies should also respond to various
heuristics and anomalies that can affect how people "hear"
warnings and advice. For example, it matters a great deal whether a
health effect is framed as a loss or a gain. People are far more
willing to forego gains than to accept losses; they are persistently
"loss averse,"1 6 and loss aversion affects people's reaction to
information about risk. Thus, real-world experiments show that
pamphlets describing the positive consequences of breast
selfexaminations (for example, women who undertake such
examinations have a greater chance of finding a tumor at a treatable
stage) are ineffective, whereas there are significant changes in
behavior from pamphlets that stress the negative consequences of
a refusal to undertake self-examinations (women who fail to
perform such examinations have a decreased chance of finding a
tumor at a treatable stage)." Similar results were found for
efforts to inform people of the advantages of energy insulation:
an emphasis on the gains from insulation produced far less
change than an emphasis on the losses from noninsulation.'</p>
      <p>Vivid and personal information can also be more effective
than statistical evidence. The same study of energy conservation
showed that it was not helpful for auditors to point to the cracks
around homeowners' doors and to recommend weatherstripping.
But striking results followed from a simple statement to the
effect that the cracks, added together, would equal a hole the size
of a basketball, combined with the question: "And if you had a
hole that size in your wall, wouldn't you want to patch it up?
That's what weatherstripping does." 89 So, too, the "availability"
heuristic, discussed above,3" means that certain events that
can be easily recalled will seem more probable than they are in
fact; regulators should respond to and take advantage of this
heuristic in attempting to convey accurate information.</p>
      <p>Finally, there is evidence that people sometimes try to
reduce cognitive dissonance by discounting certain risks.39' When
dissonance is at work, information about risk may be discounted,
and hence information campaigns can fail. In order to convey
information effectively, regulators should attempt to respond to
danger posed by dissonance reduction. Efforts to convey
information about the risk of AIDS, for example, appear to be adversely
affected by a frequent tendency of people to assume that the risk
does not apply to them.392 In many cases, this appears to be an
irrational form of denial, spurred in part by a perception that
condom use detracts from sexuality.393 It has been suggested
that private and public actors concerned about the spread of
AIDS should attempt to convey information not merely by stating
the facts, but also by doing so in a way that is intentionally

      <p>Effective regulatory emphasis on information disclosure
should learn from these risk-communication investigations. To
provide meaningful information about risk, regulators should
learn what people already know and assume, as well as what
they need to know. Appropriate information must then be
developed, tested, and refined until empirical investigation
demonstrates that the intended information is, in fact, being
conveyed. 95 The next step in information- and education-based
regulatory strategies is to incorporate these insights.</p>

      <title>C. Economic Incentives</title>
      <p>By economic incentives, we mean financial penalties imposed
on harm-producing behavior, and financial rewards attached to
harm-reducing behavior. Such penalties or rewards might
supplement and sometimes even displace command-and-control
regulation. The Clinton Order firmly and specifically endorses economic
incentives; it favors performance standards over design standards
and specifies "user fees or marketable permits" as remedies of
choice. Economic incentives appear to be playing a role in the
regulatory policy of the Clinton Administration.39</p>

means for achieving social objectives. 97 Often it would be far
better, on economic grounds, for government (a) to create
economic incentives to engage in socially desirable conduct, and (b) to
permit the market to decide how companies respond to those
incentives. It is especially inefficient for government to dictate
technology. A far better approach is to impose a fee or a tax on
harmful behavior,398 and to let market forces determine the

government to set the total quantity of a pollutant that will be
permitted, then grant or sell a fixed number of tradable allowances
or permits to discharge that substance. Government should
generally impose fees on those who put pollutants into the
atmosphere-instead of (for example) mandating a particular
substance for use in motor vehicles. Consumption of the
harm-producing good will decline. Producers will shift to less harmful
methods of production.</p>
      <p>More generally, government might adopt a simple, two-step
reform policy in the area of social risks and social harms. 99
First, those who impose harm should be required to pay for
it-by purchasing permission to do so, perhaps through a
licensing procedure. Second, those who obtain the resulting permission
should be able to trade their "licenses" with other people. In the
pollution context, this would mean that people who reduce their
pollution below a specified level could trade their "pollution
rights" for cash. In one move, such a system would create
market-based disincentives to pollute and market-based incentives
for pollution control. Such a system would also reward rather
than punish technological innovation in pollution control, and do
so with the aid of private markets. Very generally, and quite
outside the environmental area, it makes sense to think about
programs of this sort for regulation of harmful behavior."°°</p>
      <p>An idea of this kind might be made part and parcel of a
system of "green taxes." With such a system, government might
impose taxes rather than mandates on people who impose
externalities on others-users of dirty automobiles, smokers,
farmers who employ undesirable pesticides, coal-fired power
plants, and users of other products that contribute to destruction
of the ozone layer or to the greenhouse effect. Tax levies of
various sorts are used by many nations already, though they have
qualification is necessary here: Sometimes the apparent victim of the harmful conduct is
in the best position to avoid the harm, and in such cases it is possible to say that the
apparent victim should be charged with taking preventive or remedial measures. An
example would be a case in which workers could cheaply prevent the costs of a chemical
in the workplace by wearing masks or clothing that prevent the harm from occurring. Of
course, there may be moral or other grounds for deciding not to place the responsibility to
avoid harm on the cheapest cost avoider.</p>

Colum J Envir L 171 (cited in note 348).</p>

been slow in coming to the United States."' These levies have
had, or are projected to have, good results. Thus a higher tax on
leaded gasoline in Great Britain increased the market share of
unleaded gas from 4 percent to 30 percent within less than a
year.4 2 It is estimated that a tripling of pesticide prices would
cut pesticide use in half4.0 3 It is also estimated that a fee of
$110 per ton on carbon would decrease carbon dioxide emissions
by 20 percent from previous 1988 levels by 2005.' An added
advantage of such strategies is that they generate government
revenues, thus reducing public deficits.4 5</p>
      <p>Economic incentives could be applied in other areas as well.
Workers' compensation plans, for example, operate to enhance
workplace safety. According to a careful study, "If the safety
incentives of workers' compensation were removed, fatality rates
in the United States economy would increase by almost 30
percent. Over 1,200 more workers would die from job injuries every
year in the absence of the safety incentives provided by workers'
compensation."4 6 This contrasts with a mere 2-4 percent
reduction in injuries from OSHA, an amount that links up well with
the fact that annual workers' compensation premiums are more
than one thousand times as large as total annual OSHA
penalties.40 7 The tax system could be used to punish employers who
provide dangerous workplaces.</p>

      <title>2. Democracy.</title>
      <p>It is well understood that economic incentives have
advantages from the standpoint of efficiency, and thus far we have seen
that a shift to incentives would probably be efficient and
effective. What consequences would such a shift have for democratic

wrong places. Imagine, for example, that Congress and the
citizenry-following the contemporary model-are focusing on
whether ethanol, or some other gasoline substitute, should be
required in new cars. It is perfectly predictable that in answering
this question, well-organized groups with significant stakes in the
outcome will bring their influence to bear. It is also predictable
that producers of the competing products may seek and actually
obtain regulatory benefits, and for reasons bearing little or no
relationship to environmental protection.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the underlying substantive
question-whether ethanol is actually an environmentally superior
product-will have to be resolved on the basis of technological
complexities not easily addressed by the public or its
representatives. If this is the issue on which the political process focuses,
there is likely to be a series of laws that represent not
publicspirited deliberation with a measure of broad accountability, but
instead trade-offs among well-organized private groups, or, in
Madisonian terms, government by faction. By directing attention
to means, this system creates strong incentives for interest
groups to ensure that they are favored in the legislature or the
bureaucracy.</p>
      <p>Compare a system of economic incentives. Here the issue is
not one of means, but the amount of sulfur dioxide that will be
allowed into the atmosphere-an issue to be resolved in the
process of deciding how many licenses to be given out, and for how
much pollution. An advantage of this shift is that it would ensure
that citizens and representatives would be focusing on how much
pollution reduction there should be, and at what cost. The right
question would be put squarely before the electorate. No longer
would it be possible to pretend that environmental protection is
costless. No longer would the central issue be displaced by the
largely incidental question of means.</p>
      <p>Moreover, a system of financial penalties or rewards allows
less room for interest-group maneuvering. The large
question-how much environmental protection at what cost-does not
permit legislators to favor a well-organized, narrow group, such
as the agricultural lobby or the coal lobby. Special favors cannot
be provided so readily through a system of economic incentives.
The very generality of the question will work against narrow
favoritism. To be sure, the ultimate question of pollution
reduction may be answered in a way that reflects sustained political
pressure rather than democratic deliberation. But the risks are
reduced, certainly as compared with the existing system.</p>
      <p>There are other democratic advantages as well. Economic
incentives should simultaneously promote coordination and
rationality in regulation by giving government an incentive to attend
closely, and for the first time, to how other risks are treated. This
should bring a salutary measure of structure and sense to risk
regulation in general. As an important by-product, the new
system should create a powerful incentive to obtain information
about the actual effects of pollution and pollution control. If
members of Congress are deciding on the level of risk reduction,
they will not want to do so in a vacuum, especially in light of the
significant costs of large reductions. Affected groups will
therefore be encouraged to engage in research about real-world
consequences.</p>
      <p>As we have seen, information about consequences frequently
remains in its most preliminary stages. The new premium placed
on information should be a particularly important gain. There is
every reason to design a regulatory strategy that puts a premium
on greater research, so that when we act, we know what we are
getting, and at what price.</p>
      <p>All these considerations suggest that economic
incentives-favored so firmly on economic grounds-have as one of
their principal justifications a series of democracy-reinforcing,
faction-limiting characteristics. 9</p>

      <title>3. Pre-Clinton initiatives.</title>
      <p>The movement toward economic incentives is preliminary but
real. Thus far, it has occurred mostly in the environmental area.
An important series of administrative initiatives have brought
about "emissions trading," especially under the Clean Air Act.41
Under EPA's policy, a firm that reduces its emissions below legal
requirements may obtain "credits" that can be used against
higher emissions elsewhere. Through the "offset" policy, which is
formally codified in the Clean Air Act,41' a company may locate
in an area not in compliance with national air quality standards
if and only if it can offset the new emissions by reducing existing
emissions, either from its own sources or from other firms.</p>
      <p>4r But see Heinzerling, 62 U Chi L Rev at 471-72 (cited in note 190), for cautionary
note4s1.0 See Environmental Protection Agency, Emissions Trading Policy Statement;
General Principles for Creation, Banking and Use of Emission Reduction Credits, 51 Fed
Reg 43814 (1986).</p>
      <p>411 42 USC § 7503(c) (1988 &amp; Supp 1992).
Through the "banking" policy, firms are permitted to store
emission credits for their own future use.412 Companies may also
engage in "netting," by which a firm modifies a source, but avoids
otherwise-applicable emissions limits by reducing emissions from
another source within the same plant. Existing sources may also
place an imaginary "bubble" over their plants, allowing increased
emissions levels for some emitting devices, so long as the total
emissions level meets the aggregate requirements.</p>
      <p>We now have a good deal of evidence about the emissions
trading program. For various reasons, the program's use has
been quite limited.41 A 1989 study showed forty-two federal
bubbles, ninety state bubbles, two thousand federal offsets,
between five thousand and twelve thousand acts of netting, and one
hundred acts of banking.414 Despite this limited activity, there
is considerable evidence that this policy has been successful.
Overall, the program has produced savings of between $525
million and $12 billion.415 By any measure, this is a large gain. On
balance, moreover, the environmental consequences have been
neutral or better. Offsets must, by definition, produce
environmental gains. The preliminary evidence shows favorable effects
from bubbles as well.4"6 There may be modest beneficial effects
from banking and modest adverse effects from netting4.1 ' The
overall environmental effect is therefore neutral or even good,

      <p>EPA has also permitted emissions trading for lead. Under
this policy, a refinery that produced gasoline with
lower-thanrequired lead levels could earn credits. These could be traded
with other refineries or banked for future use.419 Until the
program's termination in 1987, when the phasedown of lead
ended, emissions credits for lead were widely traded. EPA concluded
that there had been cost savings of about 20 percent over
alternative systems, making total savings in the hundreds of millions</p>
      <p>Reinventing the RegulatoryState
of dollars.42 There have been initial administrative efforts as
well with respect to water pollution and ozone depletion.42'</p>
      <p>The most dramatic program of economic incentives can be
found in the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act. The Act now
explicitly creates an emissions trading system for the control of
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, major contributors to
acid deposition. In these amendments, Congress has made an
explicit decision about the aggregate emissions level for a
pollutant.' The goal is to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by ten
million tons each year, with initial standards going into place in
1995 and much tighter standards coming into effect by 2000.'
Whether the particular decision about the size of the reduction is
the correct one may well be disputed. But there are large
democratic benefits from ensuring that public attention is focused on
that issue.</p>
      <p>The acid deposition provisions have other beneficial features.
Congress has said that polluters may obtain allowances for
emissions avoided through energy conservation and renewable energy.
In this way, conservation strategies are made privately
profitable.424 This provision creates an incentive to shift to
conservation and renewable sources, without providing further
environmental degradation.</p>
      <p>Moreover, polluters are explicitly permitted to trade their
allowances; this is a first in national legislative policy.' In this
way, entities that are able to reduce their pollution below the
specified level receive economic benefits. An especially intriguing
provision allows spot and advance sales of sulfur dioxide
allowances, to be purchased at $1,500 per ton.426 Through this route,
polluters must-for the first time-pay a fee for their pollution.</p>

Equally intriguing is a provision calling for auction sales of
specified numbers of sulfur dioxide allowances.4"7 Here the market is
permitted to set the price for polluting activity. For example, in
the first auction of these rights, in 1993, the average price for the
right to discharge one ton of sulfur dioxide in 1995 was $156; by
1994, the market price had risen to $159 per ton.428</p>
      <p>For the most part, however, the Clean Air Act does not
require polluters to pay for their "licenses." Instead, government is
granting initial marketable pollution allowances to existing
sources for free. This might be a short-term measure to protect
reliance interests underlying existing uses, for political or more
substantive reasons. As further experience with these approaches
develops, perhaps Congress will take the next step of requiring
dischargers to pay for their emissions by requiring polluters to
purchase their allowances in the first place. Executive Order
12866 holds out promise that future legislative and
administrative initiatives will pursue regulation through incentive-altering
structures more fully.</p>

      <title>4. Initial Clinton initiatives.</title>
      <p>Executive Order 12866 is already having significant effects
on the development of alternative regulatory strategies. The
Clean Water Act is up for reauthorization this year, and the
Clinton Administration, through EPA, has put forward a
comprehensive set of proposals for revamping administration of the Act
(the Clean Water Initiative, or "CWI"). These proposals include
measures to deal with toxic discharges; nonpoint sources of
pollution; watersheds; and the funding, monitoring, and enforcement
aspects of water pollution control.</p>
      <p>The Clinton CWI reflects the Executive Order's influence at
every turn and, more generally, the prevalent techniques by
which regulatory policy is now made. To begin with, the CWI is
accompanied by an extensive analysis of the benefits and costs of
the proposed new regulatory approaches.2 9 Moreover, where
commensurating benefits and costs would involve controversial
value judgments, the analysis does not attempt to force a single
metric on the problem and obscure important qualitative

tions. For example, the analysis carefully documents the physical
water-quality benefits to be expected without attempting to
monetize these in order to "weigh" them against costs.' ° In one
area where some basis for attaching dollar values to the relevant
benefits plausibly exists (the value to urban households of clean
water for various purposes), the analysis attempts to do so."
But the analysis does not hide the uncertainty behind these
estimates, and it consistently makes its underlying assumptions
clear. A strong emphasis is placed throughout on more flexible
regulatory strategies that pursue the most cost-effective approach
to producing a given level of benefits.</p>
      <p>Thus, rather than requiring all municipalities (as current
law does) to meet the same standards for combined sewer
overflows and storm water discharges, the CWI proposes different
regulatory regimes for large and small cities." Similarly, the
CWI proposes building on the recent Clean Air Act approach by
using market mechanisms, such as tradable permits, to improve
water quality in the most efficient way. The basic concept here is
that all sources discharging into the same body of water in a
similar manner should be permitted to negotiate among
themselves (through trading discharge permits) as to how to achieve a
federal water-quality standard for that body. EPA estimates that
about 940 bodies of water would benefit from trades between
certain point sources and nonpoint sources, and 210 bodies of
water would be able to benefit from trades between point
sources. 3 In addition, EPA has identified numerous public
treatment plants that would be able to reduce pollution more
cheaply by negotiating reductions in inputs from the relevant
sources. All told, EPA estimates that permitting trades of these
sorts would achieve the same level of water-quality improvement
at savings of between $658 million to $7.5 billion peryear.4 '
"' Thus, EPA projects that its proposals for nonpoint source controls will produce
measurable water-quality improvements in 7.1 million lake acres and 156,200 river miles;
or that these proposals have a "high or medium" likelihood of producing measurable
improvement in 52 percent of impaired or threatened rivers and 63 percent of lakes. Id at

reduce the average number of overflows from fifty to eighty events per year to
approximately three to four; this would reduce the number of water-quality violations for each

35 to 65 percent the annual discharges of various chemicals and toxic substances. Id at

      <p>This attention to more flexible, cost-effective regulatory
strategies is evidenced in the Initiative's bottom-line summary of its
cost consequences. The analysis projects that if the CWI were
adopted as proposed, it would lead to additional incremental
expenditures of $5 to $9.6 billion per year." But the analysis
also claims that this is vastly less-amounting to savings of $29
to $33.8 billion-than would be generated under the regulatory
approaches required by current law. 8 The important point is
not that these numbers are to be believed (although even if
discounted substantially, they still suggest roughly the magnitude of
expected savings from more flexible regulatory strategies). More
significantly, Executive Order 12866 is already bringing about
systematic analysis of major new regulatory initiatives by
encouraging new means to environmental ends.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-31">
      <title>5. Qualifications.</title>
      <p>In some areas, economic incentives are inappropriate. If
government seeks to ban a substance entirely, a prohibition
makes sense, rather than a high fee for marketing or use. At
least if the benefits of the substance do not outweigh the danger,
and if less dangerous substitutes are available, a ban is the
preferred course.</p>
      <p>In addition, where economic incentives are warranted, it is
sometimes best to regulate quantity rather than price.
Marketable permits that regulate the quantity discharged, rather than
emission fees, may well be the better approach to market
strategies for pollution reduction. Setting emission fees at the right
level to achieve the desired reduction requires detailed (marginal
cost and benefit) information, which is usually unavailable, with
respect to an industry's demand curve for emissions. In contrast,
once the acceptable total level of emissions is determined, it is
much easier to determine the appropriate quantity different
producers should be permitted to discharge. That is what
quantity-based marketable permits or allowances do. When these
permits are traded, the market will then set their price. Although
emissions fees are typically the way theorists analyze incentive
approaches to pollution regulation, these approaches are often
more appropriately pursued through quantity-based permits or

allowances." Auctions are also a promising approach, with the
benefit of market rather than governmental setting of initial
prices for the allowances."</p>
      <p>On the other hand, fees or taxes may sometimes be
preferable. An advantage of taxes as a response to (say) pollution
problems is that the government need not even calculate the socially
optimal level of pollution, a complex question to be sure. Rather
than compute the tax at a level designed to achieve a
predetermined quantity (a difficult task, for reasons described above),
government could simply tax polluters at a level equal to the
harm done to others from the pollution generated. On a standard
view, this would generally equal the lower of either the cleanup
costs, or the amount of money society is willing to accept in
exchange for living with the pollution. Under this approach, the
polluters would internalize the social cost of polluting, and would
have every incentive to pollute at the socially optimal level.
Computing the social harm done from a given unit of pollution may
well be easier in many contexts than computing the total socially
optimal quantity. Moreover, this approach allows the market to
respond to fluctuations in the socially optimal quantity, which
may frequently arise from changes in technology, market
substitutes, increased demand, and so forth.</p>
      <p>The main difficulty with this approach stems from the
problem of calculating the amount of the fee or tax. Cleanup costs are
often incalculable, and there are problems with relying on
aggregated willingness to pay, even if it is calculable."9 Nonetheless,
there are undoubtedly circumstances in which pollution taxes are
better than quantity limits, because taxes are a better response
to government's informational limits. Which approach is best
cannot be decided in the abstract.</p>
      <p>As we have noted, sometimes economic incentives are
undesirable for what we have described as expressive reasons.
Perhaps a curbside tax is a more efficient response to the problem of
solid waste disposal than mandatory recycling, at least in the
short term (though this could encourage people to dispose of their
wastes in more covert, and environmentally harmful, ways)."0</p>
      <p>See James E. Krier, MarketablePollutionAllowances, 25 U Toledo L Rev 449,
45253 (1994).</p>

Approachto RegulatingMunicipalSolid Waste, 17 Ecol L Q 655, 687-90 (1990).
But mandatory recycling might affect social norms with respect
to consumption, waste disposal, and environmental protection, in
a way that has better long-term consequences, and that in any
case responds better to the public's understanding of how best to
conceive of social obligations in the area of solid waste disposal.
The choice between curbside taxes and mandatory recycling
cannot be resolved in the abstract. But insofar as economic
incentives treat a public bad as a commodity, they might be
objectionable on expressive grounds. It is rarely urged, for example, that
the emissions trading model makes sense in the
antidiscrimination area; a "discrimination license" would be inconsistent with
the general effort to delegitimate racial prejudice."'</p>
      <p>A final problem is that a system of economic incentives can
bring about distortions that must be addressed through
governmental action. In the environmental area, emissions trading
programs can lead to "hot spots," which occur when trades lead
sources to concentrate pollution in some local area."2 There are
important equitable issues here, connected to those treated
above: the "hot spots" may have unfortunate distributional
effects, burdening identifiable social groups."3 This is less of a
problem to the extent that the pollutant has no local effects and
is troubling only when mixed in a larger environment (which
might be true, to a significant degree, of sulfur dioxide).'" But
where local concentration effects are a problem, controls on
trades or location of sources will have to be reintroduced. Indeed,
the regulatory approach to trades in nitrogen oxides already
manifests such an approach. Unlike with sulfur dioxides, trades
in nitrogen oxides (which cause smog) must be approved by
environmental officials in the states where the extra pollutants will
be admitted; in addition, such trades are supposed to be
"directionally correct," in that sellers must be upwind of buyers."5

      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>This Article has emphasized three principal points. The first
involves regulatory institutions. The second involves regulatory
ends. The third involves regulatory means.</p>
      <p>We have suggested that an institution in OMB to oversee
and coordinate regulatory policy is, at least potentially, highly
salutary. Staffed by appropriate employees, such an entity could
help coordinate solutions to similar problems that arise across
different agencies. Moreover, by introducing a more
comprehensive perspective on risk regulation, such a body could encourage
sensible priority setting. Executive Order 12866 takes
coordination a step further than the Reagan-Bush approaches. It does so,
most importantly, by attempting to promote early intrabranch
discussion of regulatory proposals and to ensure more continuous
consultation about regulatory goals. This reform is part of a
conspicuous effort to reduce agency-OIRA antagonism by
encouraging cooperation at all stages of rule making. The Order also takes
the important step of including the independent agencies, if only
in a modest, procedurally oriented way.</p>
      <p>Executive Order 12866 begins as well to address the conflict
between centralization and participation. The Order requires
disclosure of contacts with private groups. It also opens up the
process of discussion between OMB and the agencies-a step that
might be legally unnecessary, but is nonetheless desirable.
Finally, the Order is plainly designed to take advantage of information
from affected persons at early stages of agency action. 7 These
measures reflect appreciation not only of the need for relevant
information, but also of the central role that public trust plays in
risk perception, evaluation, and remediation.</p>
      <p>With respect to the current institutional framework, our
principal suggestion is that in its implementation, Executive
Order 12866 should be used to create better priority setting. This
' See Howard Latin, Ideal Versus Real Regulatory Efficiency: Implementation of
Uniform Standardsand "Fine-Tuning"Regulatory Reforms, 37 Stan L Rev 1267, 1331-32
(1985).</p>
      <p>"' See Exec Order No 12866 §§ 1(b)(9), 4(e), 3 CFR at 640, 643-44 (cited in note 18).

Regulatory Affairs, in Colloquium, 8 Admin L JAm U at 53 (cited in note 18).
idea is only incipient in Executive Order 12866. Toward this end,
OIRA (perhaps bolstered by the addition of employees trained in
relevant fields in addition to economics and policy analysis)
should generate recommendations about which risk priorities
ought to be viewed as most pressing." As we have emphasized,
the judgment about which risks are most pressing, and about
which problems are most severe, does not depend solely on
quantity or on numbers of lives saved. It depends a great deal on the
context in which risks are imposed and on such factors as
whether relevant risks are catastrophic, irreversible, involuntarily
imposed, faced by future generations, or inequitably distributed.</p>
      <p>Precisely how these recommendations might be turned into
policy commitments requires further thought about the best mix
of democratic and technocratic influences. Certainly, OIRA's
efforts are unlikely to be productive without a firm commitment
to better risk management at the presidential or vice presidential
level. Under the right circumstances, OIRA might be given some
substantive power to define risk priorities, or perhaps Congress
would act on OIRA's recommendations. For now, OIRA could at
least move the reform process forward by providing information
and recommendations about risk priorities. As we have said, this
view of OIRA's role is, at most, incipient in Executive Order
12866, but we think such a role would contribute significantly to
improving regulation.</p>
      <p>In order to monitor OIRA activity, new mechanisms should
be created to allow something in the way of official and private
"performance review," through studies showing which regulations
have been issued by the Administration, with particular
attention to their anticipated and actual real-world consequences.
Such a step would create good incentives for OIRA and also
enable the public to see what, as a matter of substance, has been
done in the regulatory arena. Thus far OIRA's attention appears
to have been focused mostly on procedural matters,"9 and
insufficiently on the hard (and far more important) substantive
issues involved in improving regulation.</p>
      <p>On the question of regulatory ends, Executive Order 12866
is, perhaps understandably, a bit uncertain. The Order does not
embody a clear conception of what it means for regulation to be
rational. The Order qualifies the Reagan-Bush conception of
costbenefit analysis, but it does not reject the technique entirely.</p>
      <p>See Colloquium, 8 Admin L J Am U at 53 (cited in note 18).</p>
      <p>See Report on Executive Order No 12866, 59 Fed Reg at 24290 (cited in note 28).
Instead, it requires a modified form of cost-benefit analysis, one
that calls on agencies to incorporate ambiguous concerns for
"equity" and "distributive impacts" into CBA. There is evident
doubt about the prior use of cost-benefit techniques; attenuated
endorsement of the basic method; and vague modifications that
leave the final outcome, in terms of actual effects on agency
policy, quite unpredictable.</p>
      <p>The best way to progress beyond this ambivalence is to
recognize its causes. We have focused on three such causes:
legitimate conflicts between expert and lay value systems and
conceptions of rationality; the incommensurability of some benefits and
costs that can only be compared qualitatively; and the relevance
of expressive concerns in choosing regulatory policies. We do not
urge a general abandonment of analytic approaches to regulatory
policy, nor do we deny the importance of CBA or comparative
risk assessment, especially in a period in which regulation is far
too costly a means of achieving its own goals. We have, however,
argued for qualifying conventional CBA, and for embodying in
CRA an understanding of qualitative differences among risks.
Perhaps the qualification could take place through formal
analysis that incorporates unconventional variables. But if we attempt
to incorporate all relevant concerns into policy analysis at the
same time, we risk undermining the genuine benefits that more
analytic approaches can provide.</p>
      <p>Instead, we might split the process of CBA into two stages.
In the first, the focus should be on a quantitative cost-benefit
assessment of those dimensions that can properly be subject to this
approach. To deal with incommensurability problems, the
analysis should disaggregate benefits and costs so as to indicate how
they are distributed over various groups and interests. In the
second stage, agencies should take into account differences
between expert and lay value frameworks, concerns for equity, the
expressive dimensions of the choice, and other relevant values
not subject to the cost-benefit approach. Perhaps mechanisms
could be created to promote citizen evaluation of regulatory
alternatives, though any efforts in this direction must necessarily
be tentative and experimental. CRA might proceed similarly,
with attention to the sorts of factors that we have emphasized
here.</p>
      <p>With respect to regulatory means, Executive Order 12866 is
also a step in the right direction. A pervasive problem with
national regulatory law is the use of rigid, highly bureaucratized
command-and-control regulation, which dictates, at the national
level, risk control strategies for hundreds, thousands, or millions
of companies in an exceptionally diverse nation. Such regulation
is highly inefficient. Even more fundamentally, such strategies
are deficient from the standpoint of a well-functioning democratic
process. Often they ensure that citizens and representatives will
be devoting their attention not to general questions of
value-what levels of risk reduction and cost trade-offs are
appropriate-but instead to the largely incidental and publicly
inaccessible question of what technologies are now available. They focus
on the question of regulatory "means," a focus that increases the
power of well-organized private groups by allowing them to press
the law in the service of their own parochial ends.</p>
      <p>In this light, it is no wonder that some observers think that
our current system is a kind of Madisonian nightmare, in which
James Madison's vision of deliberative democracy has been
transformed into a system of government as a series of interest-group
deals.450 Executive Order 12866 holds out much promise on this
front. It adopts a kind of presumption against
command-andcontrol regulation. It presages a greater shift to economic
incentives, to informational remedies, and to performance rather than
design standards. All of these are desirable suggestions. But we
have cautioned that some of these new strategies are not likely to
be effective unless they deal with the ways in which ordinary
people process and conceive of risks.</p>
      <p>The solution to this problem lies in strategies that respond to
people's background assumptions and to their diverse valuations
of diverse risks. Indeed, a principle of this kind-that risk
evaluation should take into account informed public
valuations-should be placed at the center of modern efforts to
reinvent the regulatory state. We have suggested that such efforts
could promote economic goals, by reducing the billions of dollars
unnecessarily spent on regulation and by ensuring that resources
are devoted to the many serious problems that remain
inadequately addressed. Such efforts could promote democratic goals
as well, by reducing interest-group power, poor priority setting
unreflective of public judgments, and the role of sensationalist
anecdotes in regulatory policy. A reinvented government could
simultaneously increase efficiency and improve the democratic
character of the regulatory state. This task has technocratic
dimensions, but it is far from only technocratic. It also requires
government to respond to public understandings and valuations
