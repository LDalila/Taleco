Availability Cascades 
and Risk Regulation 
Timur Kuran* and Cass R. Sunstein** 
An availability cascade is a self-reinforcing process of collective belief formation by which an expressedperception triggersa chain reaction that gives the perception increasingplausibility through its rising availability in public discourse. The drivingmechanism involves a combination ofinformationaland reputationalmotives: Individuals endorse the perception partly by learning from the apparent beliefs of others and partly by distorting their public responses in the interest of maintainingsocial acceptance. Availability entrepreneurs-activistswho manipulate the content ofpublic discourse-striveto trigger availability cascades likely to advance their agendas. Their availability campaigns may yield social benefits, but sometimes they bring harm, which suggests a needfor safeguards. Focusingon the role of mass pressures in the regulation of risks associated with production, consumption, and the environment, Professors Timur Kuran and Cass R. Sunstein analyze availabilitycascades and suggest reforms to alleviate theirpotential hazards. Theirproposals include new governmentalstructures designed to give civil servants better insulation againstmass demandsfor regulatorychange and an easily accessible scientific databaseto reducepeople's dependence on popular(mis)perceptions.

INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of this article is to identify a set of interlinked social mechanisms that have important, sometimes desirable, but at other times harmful effects on risk regulation. The harmful effects range from inconsistent health regulations to mass anxiety about foods with no scientifically confirmed health hazards. The underlying mechanisms help shape the production of law through their effects on legislators, administrative agencies, and courts. 
The mechanisms presented below are mediated by the availabilityheuristic, a pervasive mental shortcut whereby the perceived likelihood of any given event is tied to the ease with which its occurrence can be brought to mind. Cognitive psychologists consider the availability heuristic to be a key determinant of individual judgment and perception. They have demonstrated that the probability assessments we make as individuals are frequently based on the ease with which we can think of relevant examples.' Our principal claim here is that this heuristic interacts with identifiable social mechanisms to generate availability cascades-social cascades, or simply cascades, through which expressed perceptions trigger chains of individual responses that make these perceptions appear increasingly plausible through their rising availability in public discourse. Availability cascades may be accompanied by counter-mechanisms that keep perceptions consistent with the relevant facts. Under certain circumstances, however, they generate persistent social availability errors-widespread mistaken beliefs grounded in interactions between the availability heuristic and the social mechanisms we describe.2 The resulting mass delusions may last indefinitely, and they may produce wasteful or even detrimental laws and policies. 
An availability cascade subsumes two of the special cascades that have recently received considerable attention in the social sciences, though not in law: informational cascades and reputational cascades.' An informational

To be more specific, suppose that the words and deeds of certain individuals give the impression that they accept a particular belief. In response to their communications, other individuals, who lack reliable information, may accept that belief simply by virtue of its acceptance by others. As long as members of the relevant group are heterogeneous along one or more dimensions (e.g., initial personal information, willingness to rely on others for information, timing of social contacts), the transformation of the distribution of beliefs can take the form of a cascade, known also as a bandwagon or snowballing process.4 Not every member of a society experiencing an informational cascade need be influenced; those with considerable private information may remain unswayed. Under the right conditions, however, many or most of the society's members, potentially even all, will end up with essentially identical beliefs, which may well be fanciful. 
Insofar as society is socially fragmented, it may exhibit local informational cascades. A local informational cascade is one limited, for example, to a geographical area, a demographic subgroup, or a core of activists who share a political objective. Local informational cascades are quite common and, as we shall see, potentially quite important. 
Like an informational cascade, a reputational cascade is driven by interdependencies among individual choices. It differs, however, in the underlying personal motivations. In the case of a reputational cascade, individuals do not subject themselves to social influences because others may be more knowledgeable. Rather, the motivation is simply to earn social approval and avoid disapproval. In seeking to achieve their reputational objectives, people take to speaking and acting as if they share, or at least do not reject, what dani et al., Learningfrom Others]; Sushil Bikhchandani, David Hirshleifer & Ivo Welch, A Theory of Fads,Fashion,Custom, andCulturalChangeas InformationalCascades, 100 J.

If a particular perception of an event somehow appears to have become the social norm, people seeking to build or protect their reputations will begin endorsing it through their words and deeds, regardless of their actual thoughts. As in the informational case, the outcome may be the cleansing of deviant perceptions, arguments, and actions from public discourse. And just as informational cascades may be limited in their reach, there may exist local reputationalcascades-self-reinforcing processes that reshape the public pronouncements of particular subgroups without affecting those of the broader group. 
Reputational and informational cascades are not mutually exclusive. Ordinarily, they exhibit interactions and even feed on one another.5 The resulting composite process, which is generally triggered by a salient event, is what we are calling an availability cascade.6 
Social agents who understand the dynamics of availability cascades and seek to exploit their insights may be characterized as availability entrepreneurs. Located anywhere in the social system, including the government, the media, nonprofit organizations, the business sector, and even households, these entrepreneurs attempt to trigger availability cascades likely to advance their own agendas. 7 They do so by fixing people's attention on specific problems, interpreting phenomena in particular ways, and attempting to raise the salience of certain information. For example, availability entrepreneurs acting on behalf of corporations focus on cases of strikingly large punitive damages awards as a means of building support for tort reform. Likewise, environmental organizations draw attention to apparent disasters (e.g., Love CONSEQUENCES OF PREFERENCE FALSIFICATION 157-95, 289-309 (1995) (describing the interactions between public discourse and private thought). 
cascades. Another broad category consists of networking cascades,which are driven by increasing returns to network size. The utility people derive from e-mail rises with the number of people on the Internet, which means that the Internet's expansion, once the process is under way, is selfreinforcing.

Such availabilitycampaigns often produce social benefits by overcoming public torpor and fueling debates on long-festering though rarely articulated problems. These desirable effects can arise in domains as diverse as economic regulation, identity politics, and social customs. At the same time, availability campaigns sometimes do great harm by producing widespread availability errors.10 This danger points to the need for institutional safeguards to ensure better priority-setting and fuller use of scientific knowledge. Proper safeguards, which need not entail either "more" regulation or "less" regulation, can save both lives and dollars. 
Offering recent examples of availability cascades that have resulted in socially harmful regulatory responses, we shall propose institutional reforms to insulate the government and the legal system against the political pressures generated by harmful cascades. Insofar as the reforms turn out to be effective, they would ensure that when government responds to political pressures, it does so because the underlying problems are serious. Although our proposals are developed with special reference to the tripartite governmental system of the United States, with minor modifications they can be applied to any democratic system. Our analytical framework and policy conclusions carry major implications for both populist and deliberative conceptions of democracy. A central theme in contemporary debates on democracy is that political judgments should reflect much more than a technocratic exercise; these judgments should be based on the facts, to be sure, but also on people's reflective values, including their tolerance for uncertainty. The analysis below is followed by concrete proposals on how these objectives can be advanced. 
All of our major illustrations involve availability cascades pertaining to the regulation of risks," a topic especially well-suited to exploring interactions between democracy and law. We hasten to point out, however, that the general framework can be applied to a wide variety of other areas. Among the diverse social transformations that exhibit striking examples of availability cascades are the rise and decline of McCarthyism; the struggle for black civil rights; the student rebellions of the 1960s; the spread of affirmative action and the recent explosion of public opposition to it; the rise of feminism, the anti-tax movement, and the religious right; ongoing campaigns against pornography, hate speech, smoking, health maintenance organizations, and

or animals. As legend has it, Gertrude Stein gave a more engaging definition. Faced with William James' exam question, "What is risk?" she offered a concise answer: "This is." the burning of black churches; the spread of ethnic and religious separatism across the world; the persistence and sudden fall of communism; the global turn toward market-friendly government policies; campaigns for safe sex; the enforcement of Megan's Law, designed to inform a community when a convicted sex offender moves in; and finally, the emergence of the Federalist Society at American law schools. 12 
Legal scholars are now devoting considerable attention to the virtues and vices of rational actor models, including those of models that accommodate social influences. 13 It will therefore be useful to specify at this juncture how our approach bears on various claims in the existing literature that, for all its diversity, falls under the rubric of "rational choice." There is nothing irrational about participating in an informational cascade. Often people have little information about the magnitude of a risk or the seriousness of an alleged social problem. They stand to gain from tuning into, and letting themselves be guided by, the signals of others. Although informational cascades may cause false beliefs to spread and strengthen, they are nonetheless consistent with individual rationality as the concept is generally understood. Indeed, models of this phenomenon are expressly based on the rational actor framework. They treat individuals as utility maximizers who weigh all their options.14 Nor is there anything irrational about being concerned with one's reputation or anything rational about being unconcerned. To lack an interest in protecting and improving one's reputation is not an indicator of rationality; rather, it is a mark of sociopathy. Models of reputational cascades depart from the conventional economic model merely by recognizing that reputation is an ingredient of individual utility functions. 
The only element of our analysis that challenges the conventional rational actor model is the role we attribute to the availability heuristic. Those who have investigated this heuristic tend to consider it a cognitive limitation or, to use alternative terminology, an indicator of quasi-rationality.

stress that the heuristic confirms the difficulties people face in processing information. 15 But using the availability heuristic may be entirely rational from the standpoint of an imperfectly informed real agent. After all, the cognitive powers of a real agent, unlike those of the fictitious agents in conventional models, are limited. People who seek to minimize search and decision costs, and who look for reliable information about a particular risk, may do best to form their assessments according to what incidents come most readily to mind. It is true, however, that the availability heuristic can produce systematic and persistent misperceptions. It also appears that people resort to this heuristic more than they would if they were perfectly rational. 6 But we do not need to pursue these points here. None of our analysis rides on the precise definition of what it means to be rational. What does matter is that we consider a society composed of boundedly rational individuals who benefit immensely from using cognitive rules of thumb. 
This article contributes to the nascent field of behavioral analysis of law,17 which stresses the significance of both cognitive limitations and social influences. Steering clear of the most vexing controversies about the extent to which people are "rational," we explore how interactions between people's reliance on the availability heuristic and identifiable social mechanisms direct the transformation of laws and policies. The consequences can be socially disastrous, so we proceed to explore institutional reforms that may diminish the potential hazards. 
Part I begins with an account of an availability cascade that has imposed immense costs on Americans, and it continues with shorter accounts of two additional cases. Forming the article;s theoretical core, Parts II and HI provide a conceptual framework for studying availability cascades and identifying their social and legal consequences. Part IV draws implications for the regulation of risks within a democratic social order. Addressing the appropriate role of science, it also points to the possible disadvantages of basing laws and policies solely or mechanically on publicly expressed judgments. This Part also connects availability cascades with democratic aspirations, including the ideal of deliberative democracy. Our concrete policy suggestions are in Part V, which includes proposals to improve the workings of Congress, the courts, and the executive branch. Offering institutional de15. See, e.g., RICHARD H.

Finally, Part VI goes beyond the subject of risk regulation, touching on the broader social significance of availability cascades. 
I. COSTLY AVAILABILITY ERRORS 
We now present three examples of availability errors, which will form a background for the subsequent analysis. The first, which is the most detailed, will be particularly valuable in demonstrating the significance of availability cascades, including their potentially lasting influence on law and policy.', 
Between 1942 and 1953, the Hooker Chemical Company filled Love Canal, an abandoned waterway that feeds into the Niagara River in New York State, with more than 21,000 tons of chemical waste. 19 It then covered the waste with dirt and sold Love Canal to the Niagara Falls Board of Education for $1.20 The local government developed the area, turning it into a neighborhood of more than 200 houses.21 The neighborhood was settled in 1957, and the site of the old canal, which many of the new homes bordered, became a school and a playground. 
After several years of unusually heavy precipitation, the canal overflowed its banks in 1976.22 In that year a commission responsible for monitoring the Great Lakes detected the insecticide Mirex in Lake Ontario fish, and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation identified Love Canal as a major source. When the local press began reporting that area residents were worried about the health effects of Love Canal, frighten18. Perceptive readers may sense that in trying to convince them of the availability heuristic's significance we will be exploiting their own reliance on this heuristic. We plead guilty!

ing tales spread quickly: 23 children being burnt, omnipresent odors inducing nausea, undrinkable water, and black sludge everywhere.24 According to the front-page stories, residents feared that the buried chemicals had resurfaced, making their neighborhood unlivable. 
At this stage, neither the state government nor the federal government attempted to reassure the residents about their neighborhood's safety, probably for fear that such efforts would only engender distrust and because they thought the anxieties would dissipate on their own. Taking the cautious route, government officials ordered a series of tests. 25 These detected low levels of carcinogens in basements near the dump site, and in early 1978 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) confirmed the findings. The EPA also reported, however, that the observed toxicity was not at all threatening; the water was safe to drink, and Lake Ontario was not alarmingly contaminated.26 Nevertheless, lawsuits kept the residents' complaints steadily in the news. 27 
In June 1978, frightening stories in the Niagara Falls Gazette came to the attention of Lois Marie Gibbs, a housewife living in the area.2 8 Gibbs, who became president of the Love Canal Homeowners Association, played a key role in reinforcing fears of adverse health effects and mobilizing public attention. 29 Indeed, she would eventually appear on national television programs and receive invitations to the state capitol and even the White House ° In brief, she served as a leading availability entrepreneur of the episode, which culminated in the passage of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), generally known as the Superfund statute.3' 
Angered by claims in the Gazette, Gibbs organized a petition drive and started going door-to-door to mobilize protests, eventually developing "a set speech. 3 2 Partly as a result of these efforts, the local residents held a meeting, and those who "hadn't attended the meeting heard what was going on by 
A VAILAB1LITY CASCADES word of mouth. Everybody was very curious. 33 The local health department initially attempted to counter the campaign by referring to controlled studies that found no evidence of leukemia or even of low or fluctuating counts of white blood cells. But because the health department provided no interpretation of what the numbers meant, they "had no meaning" for the residents, and concerns did not dampen.34 "One woman, divorced and with three sick children, looked at the piece of paper with numbers and starting crying hysterically: 'No wonder my children are sick. Am I going to die? What's going to happen to my children?"' 35 Notwithstanding the results of scientific investigations, she felt that "no one could answer. '36 Her anxieties and fears came to be shared by the entire community, which united around the problem: "People who had been feuding because little Johnny hit little Billy were now talking to each other. They had air readings in common .... The word spread fast, and the community became close-knit. Everywhere you looked, there were people in little groups talking and wondering and worrying." 37 
Responding to the outcry, New York State Health Commissioner Robert Whalen declared a public health emergency in the area in early August of 1978.33 Characterizing Love Canal as a "great and imminent peril," he urged area residents to stay out of their basements and to avoid eating anything from their gardens. 39 He also sought the temporary relocation of twenty-five pregnant women and children under two years old, whereupon residents whom the plan would leave behind inquired why their own health should be treated as less important. Gibbs, now a widely recognized activist on the issue, was furious. 
I jumped up and said to Commissioner Whalen: "If the dump will hurt pregnant women and children under two, what for God's sake, is it going to do to the rest of us!? What do you think you're doing?" Now very emotional, I said; "You can't do that! That would be murder!" 40 She and her associates treated technical explanations as just "a bunch of baloney."'41 They also instructed residents to report to doctors and local officials any and all suspected health abnormalities. "Tell them everything," Gibbs exhorted, "If you had three pimples this time last month, and this time you have five-tell them!" 42 
A month later, in September 1978, Whalen published a report entitled Love Canal: Public Health Time Bomb, which described Love Canal as a "modem day disaster" that was "both profound and devastating. '43 Other government officials either expressed agreement with Whalen's concerns or simply stood silent. Meanwhile, Governor Hugh Carey, who was in the midst of a close contest for re-election, was trying to be at least as responsive to the concerns as Whalen.44 The stakes for his political career were already obvious, and the residents would reinforce the point by screaming at him: "You're a murderer! You're killing our children!" 45 In early August, he created a multi-agency Love Canal task force and promised state aid for the locality.46 And two weeks later he agreed that 239 of the families living closest to the canal would be relocated at state expense.4 7 The federal government, too, responded to the growing sense of crisis. The top official of the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration toured the area very visibly on August 5, 1978, and two days later President Jimmy Carter declared an emergency in the area. 48 
Within a few days of Carter's declaration, scientists re-examining the evidence began signaling that the dangers were being overblown. Their findings prompted some government officials, including Carey, to tone down their statements.49 But fears would not dissipate. On the contrary, they intensified when certain new studies, presented before Congress in early 1979, pointed to sky-high rates of nervous breakdown, miscarriage, and various diseases of the urinary system in the Love Canal area.50 These data would be thoroughly discredited two years later;51 some of the effects were evidently fictitious, and others were undoubtedly produced by panic; but at the time the data were widely reported as scientifically sound.52 To call for caution in interpreting the data, even to question their validity, was to risk fierce and widespread criticism.53 Information that flowed rapidly among groups was heightening anxieties, and those who challenged the prevailing interpretations of Love Canal were being labeled as accessories to a heinous cover-up. 
HEALTH, LOVE CANAL: PUBLIC HEALTH TIME BOMB 1, 30 (1978)). 

The title of an ABC television program on Love Canal is representative of the perceptions that now held currency nationwide: The Killing Ground.54 Similar programs followed. In October 1979, for instance, public television aired a documentary on toxic waste, with a long segment on Love Canal.55 Gibbs made every effort to keep the nation focused on Love Canal. "One day, we decided we'd take a child's coffin and an adult coffin to the state capitol ... . It was a way of keeping us in the news. 5' 6 
In January 1980 the Justice Department commissioned a study that found chromosomal abnormalities in eleven of thirty-six Love Canal residents. The study would eventually be discredited as scientifically flawed, but it was leaked to the press before peer review at the EPA, and in May the New York Times promptly gave it front-page coverage. 57 The news media descended on Love Canal once again, painting the image of an ordinary American community mired in a swamp of carcinogenic wastes as the rest of the country just watched. A resident found to have chromosomal aberrations appeared on national television, sobbing that she "just wanted to be a housewife" as in the days before the poisons of Love Canal destroyed her idyllic life.5 8 
In early 1980, at a time when Love Canal was prominently featured in network newscasts almost every day, Governor Carey established a blueribbon panel to review the scientific evidence. Remarkably, given the political climate, the panel endorsed none of the reports of serious health effects. However, its evaluation had no appreciable influence on subsequent events. In May of the same year, a group of Love Canal residents held two EPA officials hostage at the headquarters of the Homeowners Association.5 9 The next day President Carter ordered the relocation of an additional 700 families at a cost of at least $3 million.60 And soon thereafter, exploiting the President's need for his support in the Kennedy-Carter contest for that year's Democratic Presidential nomination, Carey obtained $15 million in federal assistance toward the purchase of new homes for the relocated residents. 61 
The Love Canal "time bomb," as the press dubbed it,62 was not the original source of government concern about abandoned hazardous waste dumps. Even before the 1978 news blitz, the EPA had worked on drafting an ambitious new law to address contamination problems. But publicity about Love Canal was crucial to this law's passage in 1980. Love Canal, and its attendant publicity, was a watershed event that crystallized public concern about toxic waste sites. In that year, Time magazine made the topic of waste sites a cover story, and new network documentaries followed suit. Polls conducted at the time showed that all this publicity dramatically influenced the views of Americans about industrial wastes: Eighty percent favored prompt federal action to identify and clean up potentially hazardous abandoned waste sites.63 Congress responded quickly with the Superfund statute, which called for $1.6 billion in expenditures over five years.64 
The perceptual and attitudinal transformation that occurred between 1978 and 1980 has proved enduring. Since that period, Americans have consistently ranked waste sites among the country's top environmental problems. In a highly publicized 1987 study, the EPA found that Americans rank hazardous waste sitesfirst among all environmental problems-above pesticides, acid rain, indoor air pollution, radioactive waste, water pollution, exposure to work site chemicals, tap-water contamination, and thinning of the ozone layer, among many others.65 This preeminence was confirmed by public opinion polls in 1987 and 1988.66 To this date, moreover, American presidents and serious presidential candidates of both major parties invoke abandoned waste dumps as a leading environmental problem. Congress has continued to spend vast sums on clean-up campaigns. By 1994 it had allocated a total of $13.6 billion to the cause. 67 Yet it remains unproven that the contamination of Love Canal, assuming it occurred, ever posed a significant risk to anyone. Peer-reviewed follow-up studies conducted by the New York State Department of Health uncovered no abnormal health trends among Love Canal residents, and this finding was supported by later analyses by the American Medical Association, the National Research Council, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 63 Equally significant, no subsequent study discovered any link between the identified chromosome alterations and the contamination in question. An exhaustive 1982 study by the EPA, based on 6000 samples of soil, air, and groundwater from the evacuated area and other sampling regions, found "no evidence of environmental contamination" at Love Canal.69 And in the same year the Department of Health and Human Services found that the emergency zone was "as habitable as the control areas with which it was compared. '70 A recent analysis of the data goes much further. Looking beyond Love Canal, it suggests that "hazardous waste sites pose an almost negligible risk to human health when compared with the many more fundamental risks we face. '71 
Our challenge here is to explain the dogged persistence of calls to prevent "more Love Canals." In view of the billions spent on the Superfund program, the social significance of the analytical challenge should be clear. Had these resources been devoted to the prevention of other risks, there could have been major benefits as measured in, say, life-years saved. Approximately 400,000 Americans die each year as a result of tobacco use, 300,000 die from poor diet and insufficient exercise, and many thousands more die each year from other preventable causes.72 The scientific evidence is overwhelming that poor diet produces far more cancers than abandoned hazardous waste sites. Yet during the period of skyrocketing concern over Love Canal, poor diet and exercise received almost no attention as national problems, and cigarette smoking was addressed almost exclusively through SUPERFUND: ECONOMICS, SCIENCE, AND LA\V 8 (Richard L. Revesz & Richard B. Stewart eds., 1995). Congress authorized an additional $6.9 billion in 1986 and $5.1 billion more in 1990. See id.

Indeed, until quite recently governments devoted negligible resources to fighting these causes of death, with the exception of modest informational campaigns against smoking, which were undermined by generous subsidies to tobacco farmers. At much less than the cost of Superfund, tax incentives and informational campaigns to promote better diet and exercise could probably have saved tens ofthousands of lives per year. 
We do not mean to imply that choosing priorities is simply a technocratic matter, nor that informed democratic judgments should never depart from numerical criteria. The guiding principles of priority-setting should involve subtle qualitative considerations, which will be brought into our analysis in due course. Suffice it to say here that the priority accorded to abandoned waste dumps hardly reflects what one would call the informed judgment of the American citizenry. 
In the interest of reaching the theoretical core of our argument expeditiously, our next two examples of availability cascades are more compressed than the foregoing account of the Love Canal episode. A salient phenomenon in American environmental politics is the "pollutant of the month" syndrome. The essence of this syndrome is that expressed concerns about a particular substance fuel growing anxieties, which then generate an irresistible demand for regulation. These anxieties remain in the headlines until they are bumped off by a new perceived hazard.73 
In 1989, one such pollutant was Alar, a pesticide long used on apples. 74 About one percent of Alar is composed of UDMH, a carcinogen. Alar's manufacturer, the Uniroyal Company, embarked on a two-year study of its effects, reaching the half-point of the investigation in January 1989. 75 The preliminary results showed that in rats and mice exposed to moderate amounts of Alar, there is no change in the incidence of tumors.76 But they also indicated a greater incidence of tumors in rodents exposed to high levels of UDMH. On the basis of these tentative findings, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) made a series of extrapolations, interpreting the results as implying that between 4700 and 6200 preschool children, or about one out of every 4200 exposed to Alar, will develop cancer by age six.77 A

LEAPE, ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION: LAW, SCIENCE, AND POLICY 524 (2d ed. 1996). lawyer for the NRDC said, "IfEPA doesn't think that the most potent cancer causing chemical in our food supply is grounds enough to declare it an imminent hazard and remove it from food, well, I don't know what kind of risk it takes then to declare an imminent chemical hazard. 78 
The television show 60 Minutes publicized the allegation, presenting its report against a background consisting of a red apple overlaid with a skull and crossbones.79 Ed Bradley, the program's host, began the report as follows: "The most potent cancer-causing chemical in our food supply is a substance sprayed on apples to keep them on the trees longer and make them look better."80 The story received wide coverage in newspapers, magazines, talk shows, and television news programs. It also instigated a public outcry, complete with protests from many celebrities, including actress Meryl Streep, who founded an activist group called Mothers and Others for Pesticide Limits.81 The NRDC's self-conscious agenda was to create so many repetitions of [its] message that average American consumers (notjust the policy elite in Washington) could not avoid hearing it-from many different media outlets within a short time. The idea was for the 'story' to aacnhdiecvoensau mlifeer hoafbiittss.8o2wn, and continue for weeks and months to affect policy The EPA reviewed the evidence and interpretations, concluding that the risk was vastly exaggerated: one in 111,000 rather than one in 4200.83 However, by the time the EPA made its announcement, the demand for apples had plummeted. Apples and apple products had been removed from stores and widely banned from school lunchrooms. Many people were treating apples as a highly toxic substance that one must handle with great care, and only when absolutely necessary. Moreover, doctors and poisoncontrol centers were facing a deluge of calls from frightened parents. One caller asked "whether it was safer to pour apple juice down the drain or to take it to a toxic waste dump. '8 4 In desperation, the nation's apple growers asked Uniroyal to withdraw Alar from the market. And before the year was out, but after the EPA announcement, Uniroyal agreed to stop domestic sales of Alar, evidently to avoid the costs of contested cancellation proceedings. 85 The EPA itself joined the alarmist bandwagon by announcing that it would

This is speculation, to be sure, but many risk-related scares draw some of their intensity from links to pre-existing fears. seek revisions of pertinent laws and regulations to make it easier to ban chemicals suspected of being carcinogenic. 86 
defamation suits against the NRDC and 60 Minutes8.7 But the expenses associated with this suit constitute only a small fraction of the social costs generated by the hysteria over Aar's hazards. In Washington State alone, the harm to the apple industry included at least $125 million in losses in the key six-month period. 8 The United States Department of Agriculture put aside $15 million to buy some of the surplus apples. 89 For all these costs, it is not even clear that the withdrawal of Alar resulted in a net benefit to children's health. A regulatory strategy that makes apples more expensive will lower their consumption, producing adverse health effects that may swamp any benefits from eliminating Alar. These observations suggest that Alar's withdrawal may not have survived any form of cost-benefit analysis. In any case, the EPA's initial risk estimate has turned out to be too high. According to its subsequent analyses, only one in 250,000 children exposed to Alar will develop cancer-doubtless a nontrivial risk, but less than half the initial EPA figure, and lower than that of the NRDC by a factor of sixty. carcinogenicity by a special interest group was hyped by a news organization without the most simple checks on its reliability or documentation." 91 A United Nations panel, along with others who have investigated the data, found that even the EPA's revised figure is too high. Alar does not cause cancer in mice, it concluded, and it is not dangerous to people. 92 
The process that drove the Alar scare provides another example of an availability campaign launched by availability entrepreneurs. The following account puts it dramatically: 
Words fail on Alar. The most charitable interpretation is that an environmental group ... decided to take matters into its own hands by writing a report and orchestrating its release to the media in so forceful a manner as to compel governmental action. The syndrome its report played out is by now distressingly familiar: a few suggestive tests involving tiny quantities raised way above the actual amount by extreme assumptions about children's eating habits, expanded further by statistical manipulation, extrapolated against huge populations to create row-upon-row of child cancer victims.93 
Once Aar became identified as a threat to social welfare and, in particular, the lives of helpless children, it became risky to urge restraint in interpreting the figures. No official, and certainly no politician, wants to develop a reputation for softness on matters vital to children's health. Nor, in the face of reports of danger to children, is any official eager to tell worried parents that they should patiently wait for more scientific research. If some doubters and dissenters shade their views or mute their voices in response to such reservations, the relative content of the publicly available information will obviously get distorted. Specifically, information pointing to danger will become ever more available, raising its plausibility in the eyes of the many people who use availability as a criterion for evaluating the validity of such information. In the process, moreover, the burden of justifying one's beliefs will shift increasingly toward dissenters. Thus, as the Aar cascade took off, the proponents of banning Aar could increasingly take for granted that their safety concerns would be treated with respect. For their part, the opponents had to carry an increasingly heavy burden of being suspected of insensitivity to human suffering. 
With Alar off the market, apple growers were quick to find substitutes. These substitutes might well be equally effective against pests without having the minute adverse side-effects of Aar. But we have no scientific basis for ruling out the possibility of a serious mistake. The substitutes may someday be identified as serious hazards. In any case, even if future historians judge the Aar episode to have reached an acceptable or even happy ending, there are socially cheaper ways to bring about a substitution of industrial inputs. It should not be necessary to cause widespread panic or to disrupt production and consumption patterns for the sake of preventing a dubious or minor hazard. 
A-d 11999] availability cascades can produce a lot of good. For the reasons discussed above, however, the mere fact that vast numbers of citizens are calling for the alleviation of a perceived risk, or that they are demanding a particular risk reduction program, provides no guarantee that even they would benefit from having the government sheepishly fall in line. It does not even mean that they truly desire the measures they are championing. 
Many features of the prevailing system of checks and balances offer protection against availability cascades. For example, the bicameral legislature prevents cascades within one chamber from creating legislation on their own. Still, as matters now stand, the American government is imperfectly equipped to provide meaningful resistance against social pressures grounded in misinformation. When there is an upsurge of interest in addressing a particular risk, the government loses its ability to set sensible priorities, undertake long-range planning, and enforce intertemporal consistency. 224 It has been estimated that the American government could save an additional 60,000 lives per year at no additional cost or, alternatively, save the lives it currently does for as much as $31 billion less than it now spends.22 The reforms proposed in this Part would provide instruments for achieving such gains. 
The notion of institutional safeguards against availability cascades is far from foreign to American history. Parts of the FederalistPapers show an awareness of cascades and their effects on public discourse.226 Many of the founding institutions can be understood as instruments designed to reduce dangers associated with cascades. In addition to the bicameral legislature, such instruments include national representation, federalism, and the executive veto to reopen and temper legislative debates. Numerous post-founding innovations fulfil related functions. Among them are specialized legislative committees, an appropriations committee to oversee the whole budget, and conference committees to resolve differences between legislative chambers. Individually and collectively, these structures provide opportunities for improving the accuracy of information used in policymaking, refining prioritysetting, identifying trade-offs, promoting deliberation, and reaching reasonable compromises among competing judgments and interests.

The measures proposed and defended below are meant to develop the existing system in the light of modem realities. One of our objectives is to strengthen the role of science in risk regulation-a role that several groups have tried to weaken.227 To this end, we seek to provide regulators with better insulation against sudden and intense mass calls for immediate action (partly to allow them to address significant risks that public opinion is ignoring). It bears repeating that people may legitimately find some risks less acceptable than others that are quantitatively identical. But these judgments should be made with reference to the best possible understanding of reality rather than mass hysteria. 
Our most general goal is the attainment of "comprehensive rationality" in risk regulation. All too often the government focuses on problems in isolation from related problems, and political forces hinder sensible prioritysetting. Through institutional arrangements that amount to precommitment strategies, 228 the making and implementation of laws can be shielded from myopic, ephemeral, or counterproductive social pressures. 
None of our proposals will be described in minute detail. Our intention is simply to outline certain basic institutional reforms. We begin by addressing a recent initiative designed to make it costly for availability entrepreneurs to launch cascades that generate scientifically unjustified mass anxiety.

DEMOCRACY (1995). 
The Texas lawsuit that pitted beef producers against television talk show host Oprah Winfrey229 brought into sharp relief one possible measure against harmful availability cascades: civil actions to deter individuals and groups from instigating or aggravating such cascades in the hope of profiting from the ensuing panic. Conscious of the potential advantages, twelve states have enacted product disparagement laws.230 As one might expect, many observers consider such laws to be constitutionally unacceptable devices designed to placate powerful economic actors intent on suppressing legitimate doubts about the safety of their products. 231 But the underlying issues are more complicated. For one thing, it is unclear that all or most product disparagement laws violate the First Amendment. For another, their beneficiaries would hardly be limited to industries trying to block reports about the defects of their products. Just as ordinary libel law serves to discourage public falsehoods about individuals, product disparagement laws discourage false statements about products. In each case, the purpose is to prevent availability cascades from causing irreparable damage. 
In their current form, food disparagement laws apply to perishable foods whose producers and sellers could be ruined by a cascade-induced plunge in demand. As a general rule, the laws are narrowly drawn, allowing compensatory damages only for spreading known falsehoods. They do not cover negligent falsehoods, even reckless ones. Nor are they reasonably interpreted to cover hyperbole or humor. Thus the thirty-second Honda commercial that referred to the emus raised in Texas as "the pork of the future" did not violate any food disparagement law even though it temporarily lowered the demand for emu meat. And Oprah Winfrey was acquitted of the charges brought by beef producers, apparently for lack of evidence that she said anything she knew to be false.232 
When a product is "libeled," the news may spread rapidly, bringing harm to a wide range of people. The best (and constitutionally mandated) remedy for false speech, it is often said, is more speech. 2 3 Ordinarily this is true. Yet when an availability cascade is under way, the liberty to counter false charges will not necessarily provide a corrective, and this is what product disparagement laws and ordinary libel laws acknowledge. 
Indeed, predictable social forces may reinforce rather than dampen sensational charges. One such force involves the mass media. The typical newspaper, magazine, or television station incurs a large penalty whenever it falls behind its rivals in reporting "breaking news. ' 2 4 Because a good relative position in the media hierarchy translates into disproportionately large profit differentials, a media outlet that exercises caution in reporting a frightening story may find itself at a huge, possibly irreversible, competitive disadvantage. 235 Facing a prisoner's dilemma with respect to sensational stories, it has every reason to compete aggressively to report sensationalistic stories as rapidly as possible. Another social force that reinforces sensational changes consists of reputational pressures. Evolving reputational pressures can make it personally costly for individuals to defend a disparaged product. And the consequent individual reticence may contribute to the growth and spread of availability errors. 
To the extent that they reach only intentional falsehoods, the product defamation laws appear consistent with the body of libel law currently applied to government officials and well-known figures. Under New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,236 it is constitutionally legitimate for states to require compensation for libelous statements that are intentionally false or made with reckless disregard for the truth. The rationale here is that the reputational interests of individuals are sufficiently strong to overcome the relatively weak free speech interests. If states can prohibit intentional or reckless falsehoods about people, perhaps they can also prohibit intentional falsehoods about products. This logic thus makes product disparagement laws seem constitutional. 237

or even mere negligence ought to be enough for liability with respect to either persons or products. One might think that since availability cascades can do so much harm, their instigators should face the level of deterrence that comes from requiring compensation for all negligent falsehoods. But this would be a most controversial conclusion. The general relationship between libel law and freedom of speech raises conceptual and empirical issues that we cannot take up here. 
Such a view might be challenged on the ground that products are not people. Only people have feelings that can be hurt and social positions that can be damaged, so perhaps states cannot legitimately base their product disparagement laws on the exceptionally strong interests traditionally used to support the law of libel. There is indeed a difference. But product disparagement laws do not protect products as such. When citizens are frightened through false statements about products, it is people who are genuinely injured, sometimes severely. In fact, the victims may greatly outnumber those in a typical libel case; consider the multitudes of frightened parents and the many millions of dollars lost by apple growers as a result of the Alar episode.3 8 The shareholders of the relevant companies and their employees suffer, too, as do their customers; and the anxieties caused by the knowledge of consumption risks produce a wide range of ancillary social harms. As a case in point, frightened parents, who had fed their children apples falsely described as dangerously carcinogenic, unnecessarily lost sleep-a large if difficult to measure social loss-and they had to have their children tested medically. States have strong reasons, then, to permit the imposition of compensatory damages for intentional falsehoods about products. 
To identify certain advantages of product disparagement laws and to defend their constitutionality is not, of course, to prove that on balance they are beneficial or desirable. In principle, such laws could encourage frivolous rather than meritorious suits. Even more seriously, they could deter reports about genuine product hazards. Although it is highly desirable to allow broad-ranging debate about all potential risks, the mere possibility of a lawsuit may make knowledgeable people refrain from discussing real dangers, with the net result being more, not less, loss of life. The possibility of frivolous lawsuits might be attenuated by making plaintiffs liable for all court costs, including the attorneys' fees, in the event they lose. As for the risk of excessive deterrence, it can be reduced by maintaining a sharp line between the communication of intentional falsehoods and legitimate expressions of hyperbole, doubt, and concern. But each reservation constitutes an empirical claim to be tested by experience. We do not have a sufficient basis for knowing whether the existing laws are too broad. In the present state of knowledge, it appears at least as likely that product defamation laws would do more good than harm than the other way around. 
We now turn to the core institutions of the federal government. Congress is currently quite vulnerable to availability cascades, partly because its members feel compelled to respond to mass demands for legislation simply to keep their seats, and partly because they have incentives to serve as availability entrepreneurs who work in concert with their constituents to further parochial agendas. As an institution, Congress is poorly equipped to place risks in comparative perspective. Its committee system keeps Congress highly balkanized and also increases its susceptibility to short-term pressures. Because activities of senators and representatives are carefully scrutinized by directly affected lobbies, committee members are often reluctant to publicize information, make statements, or take positions that can be used against them at election time. As a case in point, they rarely make public, let alone endorse, the monetary values that potential or actual policies ascribe to statistical lives. Nor do they talk candidly about trading lives for money. Committee members thus encourage citizens to cling to the idea that even a statistical human life is priceless. One consequence is that when an availability cascade fuels massive demand for acting on a matter under the committee's purview, the members of the committee quickly yield, and legislative action follows without any attempt at coordination with existing policies.239 
A possible method for insulating Congress from such pressures is to create a risk regulation committee entrusted with compiling information about a wide range of risk levels and empowered to set priorities. This committee would have authority over both substantive statutes and the appropriations process. It would thus operate as a check on short-term pressures by putting particular concerns in a broader context. Its basic goal would be to rank risks, publicize misallocations, and initiate legislative corrections. In its ideal form, the committee would rely heavily on prevailing scientific knowledge. At the same time, it would recognize that risk judgments and preferences constitute legitimate considerations in the determination of priorities and selection of policies. Thus, its essential function would be to prevent myopic, unduly quick, and poorly reasoned responses, not to insulate risk regulation from evolving social values. Helping to slow down, limit, and possibly even prevent availability cascades, the committee's hearings would enable Congress to "strike when the iron is cold. 2 40 
Like any government body, the risk regulation committee would most certainly become the target of well-organized lobbies intent on molding policies to their own advantage.2 4 1 But it should be possible to dampen the in239. A counteracting factor is that the committee chairs, insofar as they consider their seats secure, have a long-term interest in maintaining consistency across policies. However, even where this condition is met, the chair may not be capable of blocking the demands of the membership. 
D. Tollison & Gordon Tullock eds., 1988). centives for rent-seeking by guaranteeing that risks are put in a comparative light. The very act of comparing risks and publicizing the obtained rankings would provide a measure of protection against well-organized special interests. If the social costs of accommodating a particular lobby's demands gain widespread recognition, counter-lobbying might neutralize this lobby's political effectiveness. 
Congress has debated a number of bills designed to require agencies to engage in cost-benefit analysis.242 The use of cost-benefit analysis as the basis for regulatory decisions has been highly controversial, partly because of conceptual and empirical obstacles to quantifying either costs or benefits, 2 43 and partly because no agency is widely trusted to undertake a fair analysis.244 Although we cannot resolve these problems here, it is clear that availability cascades provide a new and distinct reason for some kind of costbenefit mandate, not as a way of obtaining an uncontroversial assessment of policy options, not as the foundation for every decision, and not because economic efficiency is the only legitimate ground for regulation, but as an instrument for producing relevant information and a common-sensical brake on measures that would do little good and possibly considerable harm. 
Wherever some salient event might cause a cascade in favor of speedy regulation, there are good reasons to support mechanisms that help identify and quantify actual risks, and also for putting "on screen" the various possible disadvantages of attempting to curb them.245 Cost-benefit analysis might therefore serve as a check on ill-advised availability campaigns. Consider, for example, the very different implications of cost-benefit analysis for a lead phasedown (amply justified) and for eliminating asbestos (a decidedly mixed picture). 246 An understanding of availability cascades certainly does not establish the usefulness of cost-benefit analysis; the proof would lie in its implementation. Yet such an understanding offers a new basis for requiring cost-benefit analysis as a means of widening the viewscreens of political actors and containing availability errors.

REGULATORY IMPACT (Richard D. Morgenstern ed., 1997). 

Other possible safeguards against harmful availability cascades would involve the executive branch, which is probably in the best position to analyze risks comprehensively. 247 Unlike the courts, the executive branch is capable of taking a bird's eye view of the entire regulatory system; and unlike Congress, it is already equipped with institutions designed to promote overall consistency. Obviously, measures adopted by the executive branch must be consistent with laws enacted by Congress; in principle, therefore, the legislature has the power to undermine any executive initiative to place regulations on more rational footing. Yet the executive branch exercises a powerful influence on public opinion, and it has considerable power to act on its own. 
The following are three complementary proposals, each of which can help prevent cascades driven by misperceptions. 
Several recent bills would require executive agencies to use "peer review" as a means of corroborating the evidence that underlies the regulations they institute.248 Under peer review, agency proposals are subject to scrutiny by informed outsiders. Many agencies have already experimented with this procedure. The argument developed in this article provides systematic reasons for expanding the ongoing experiments. 
The most critical function of peer review is to identify and correct misperceptions spread through availability cascades. While an availability cascade is in progress, and even after it has run its course, peer review can provide an important safeguard against policy responses that the facts do not justify. The Love Canal and Alar scares might have been contained at an early stage if the underlying claims had been subjected to peer review in a timely manner and the findings given wide publicity.2 49 
executive branch). 
limit, an availability cascade already under way. For the same reasons why nonscientists seek refuge in preference and knowledge falsification, scientists asked to review widely accepted data may be reluctant to raise questions if their identity is to become public knowledge. There are advantages, therefore, to providing the selected scientists anonymity. But even anonymity would not guarantee objectivity of the reviews. Scientists have biases of their own, and they may pursue personal agendas. Nor are they immune to cognitive biases. In certain contexts where predictability is particularly low, experts equipped with scientific models tend to display greater overconfidence than laypeople who understand how little they know. For an overview of this finding and many relevant references, see Matthew Rabin, Psychology and Economics, 36 J. ECON. LITERATuRE 11, 31-32 (1998). Another potential problem lies with the possibility of mistrust: For reasons unrelated 
Among the reasons why people turn to nonexperts for information on various risks is that they lack easy access to statistically accurate and scientifically up-to-date judgments. This handicap limits their capacity to compare risks and develop sound understandings of dangers associated with, for example, air travel, automobile driving, poor diet, electromagnetic fields, and infrequent exercise. To be sure, most such information may be found in publications shelved in any good library or bookstore. Alas, people seeking to educate themselves might have to read dozens of books to make the necessary comparisons. In addition, they would first have to identify the appropriate sources and learn how to standardize disparate pieces of information. There exist large potential gains, then, from making the most current and scientifically most credible information easily accessible to the widest possible audience. In the computer age, the Internet may serve as the requisite medium.2 50 
We propose the creation of a central Risk Information Site (RIS) on the World Wide Web. This site would list various risks and identify the probabilities, or range of probabilities, associated with each of them. The technology of the web allows the nesting of multiple levels of detail. The most elementary level ought to be extremely simple to follow-simple enough, perhaps, for a high-school student to check the latest scientific knowledge on, say, the risks associated with Alar or Love Canal; below this layer would lie progressively more sophisticated layers, each accessible at the click of a mouse. Where the scientific community is divided on a particular risk assessment, as it is on the thinning of the ozone layer, the RIS should make the substance of the controversy as clear as possible, allowing websurfers to review the opposing arguments. The proposed website could be designed and operated by a nongovernmental Risk Information Center (RIC), along the lines of Consumer Reports. It could even be a profit-oriented enterprise; after all, there exist profit-driven credit bureaus that enjoy an exemplary reputation because they have a stake in their maintenance. 2 1 Only if no nongovto the case at hand, nonscientists may lack trust in the scientific community. This possibility could be minimized by selecting reviewers from among members of the scientific community who are respected for their integrity. If the peer review process falls into disrepute, nonscientists will turn elsewhere for information, thus becoming more susceptible to availability errors. 
given the speed at which cascades often develop, the Internet offers obvious advantages to both information disseminators and information seekers at times when a frightening claim suddenly catches widespread attention. 
CreditInformation Sharing, 4 ECoN. & POt. 117, 121-23 (1992). See generally REPUTATION: STUDIES IN THE VOLUNTARY ELICITATION OF GOOD CONDUCT (Daniel B. Klein ed., 1997). These studies do not show that credit bureaus are infallible. Just as ConsumerReports makes mistakes, so do other information providers. The point remains that they provide generally very valuable information. ernmental entity is willing or able to undertake the task should the federal government take the lead, because a government-operated RIC would have a harder time rising above partisan politics and establishing its trustworthiness. 
Counteracting the irrational attitudes and counterproductive policy demands caused by cognitive biases and distortions of public discourse, an RIS would help individuals form their risk preferences and judgments more rationally than is currently possible.25 2 The RIS would also offer information on how other countries are dealing with particular risks, thus alerting people to possible over- or under-reactions. It might allow parties to a controversy to make their case as well as rebut their opponents. Had an RIS existed during the Love Canal episode, both Lois Marie Gibbs and her skeptics within the scientific world might have been given opportunities to post evidence supporting their respective cases as well as their reasons for doubting the opposing account. Equally important, the proposed RIS would feature systematic information on possible discrepancies between public and private opinion on ongoing controversies. To this end, it would post controlled surveys that give people anonymity along with ones that deliberately do not. These surveys would serve to identify hidden currents of opinion and unarticulated insights, thus strengthening individual resistance to the biases of public discourse and the social pressures stemming from public opinion. An even more ambitious enterprise would be to include information about the objectives of all groups with a stake in regulating particular risks. One could also publicize analyses of their political strategies. 25 3 
In a world in which highly trusted scientists quickly evaluate all perceived risks and post their findings in comprehensible form on a widely known website, availability errors of the kinds that motivated this article would be less likely to develop than they currently do. Were a news program to claim that apples carry a deadly poison, people could check the RIS to learn what is known about the identified risk. If scientific tests suggested an infinitesimal risk, fewer people would believe the claim, and no major cascade would follow. It is possible, of course, for credible tests to be nonexistent. In this event, the RIC, or possibly some other organization such as the one we will propose next, would immediately undertake new tests to evaluate the claim. If the claim proved groundless, a possibly costly cascade would be prevented without involving the courts. 
Obviously, even the most elaborate RIS cannot prevent every potentially destructive availability cascade. For one thing, just as some car buyers would rather seek guidance from their acquaintances than from Consumer erroneous information. 
"consciousness raising" with respect to threats to the environment, hospitals and insurance companies with incentives to downplay evidence of danger. Reports, many people would not consult the RIS. In addition, even highlyeducated people can be influenced by empirically baseless claims, and certain people have strong incentives to exploit this gullibility; witness the numerous promoters of accounts involving flying saucers and alien abductions, and the millions of Americans who take these accounts seriously. Nevertheless, an RIS could certainly help at the margin. Insofar as the RIS makes a difference, it would limit the need for speech-restricting measures such as the food disparagement laws discussed above. 
In 1981, President Reagan created a new agency, an Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget, to oversee risk regulation in an effort to ensure coordination and rationality. 5 4 Since that time, the functions of OIRA have changed. Under Presidents Reagan and Bush, OIRA operated essentially as a "cost-benefit" monitor that intervened in an ad hoc way to force reconsideration of inefficient or excessive regulations 5 s President Clinton, who has taken steps of his own to "reinvent government"2 56 so as to ensure greater attention to results than to processes, has de-emphasized this particular function.25 7 
In view of the dangers of availability (and unavailability) cascades, OIRA should be reinvigorated and its powers extended and strengthened. This measure would serve to deter unreasonable regulations. Specifically, the OIRA should have, and be known to have, authority over both prioritysetting and cost-benefit balancing. It should be committed to mitigating the most unfortunate effects of availability cascades, not only by keeping small risks from consuming huge resources, but also by ensuring that major risks receive attention. Where experts working under OIRA lacked confidence in risk judgments spreading through a cascade, they would conduct fact-finding exercises. And, depending on the results, they would publicize any inaccuracies in popular beliefs. Likewise, where a scientific study suggested that a particular risk judgment should be revised, OIRA would examine the study's methodology, check whether its results can be replicated, and disseminate its findings. OIRA's mission should also include the dissemination of systematic information about risks, including changes in what scientists know about particular risks and the methods for controlling them. Finally, it should con254. See Exec. Order No. 12,291, 3 C.F.R. 127, 128 § 2(c) (1981) (prohibiting regulatory action unless the benefits outweigh the costs to society).

OIRA could constitute one of the information sources for the RIS discussed above. 
If it proves infeasible to redesign OIRA along the proposed lines, and its role remains very limited, one might establish an alternative institution to publicize the inconsistencies of the prevailing regulatory system and focus attention on the most serious risks. United States Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer has suggested assembling a multidisciplinary group of welltrained risk managers, which would be authorized to divert resources from small problems to large ones.25 8 Justice Breyer's suggestion is largely consistent with our discussion. A "Breyer Group" within the executive branch could undertake the types of analyses and educational activities we are proposing here. The group would have the authority to publicize its findings about the relative seriousness of risks, require agencies to seek consistency in setting their priorities, and recommend changes in statutes, regulations, and even appropriations. A Breyer Group might even be empowered to undertake certain resource reallocations on its own. Our difference from Justice Breyer, which is perhaps only one of emphasis, lies in our view that risk evaluation has nontechnical dimensions that may require democratically determined risk policies to diverge from the types of risk rankings currently fashionable in scholarly circles.25 9 
Courts, too, have a role to play in preventing excessive reactions to availability cascades. Most naturally, they can undertake judicial review of administrative actions alleged to be "arbitrary" or "capricious" within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).2 60 The ban on arbitrary or capricious action is increasingly being understood as requiring agencies to produce plausible evidence that their actions produce "more good than harm. '261 This notion appears to embody a presumptive requirement that costs not be grossly disproportionate to benefits. 262 Thus, existing doc258. See BREYER, supranote 65, at 60-61.

trine authorizes courts to invalidate the most extreme and the most poorly conceived regulatory proposals, at least if they are not required by statutes. Courts can hardly be expected to identify availability cascades or to invalidate regulatory initiatives merely for being products of cascades. But if regulators are required to demonstrate that their policies would plausibly make things better rather than worse, taking account of all relevant variables, we will have a potentially valuable safeguard against harmful cascades. 
Ordinarily, the reach of the doctrine of "more good than harm" is limited. But in contexts in which an availability cascade produces a sudden outcry for costly action against an actually small but allegedly grave risk, this doctrine can provide courts considerable authority. At a minimum, it prohibits regulations that rest on unfounded perceptions about health risks.263 Courts might also use the doctrine as an interpretive principle in dealing with ambiguous statutes; specifically, the principle would allow agencies to exempt de minimis risks, and perhaps require them to do so, on analogy to the common law maxim that absurdity in interpretation will be avoided 64 The doctrine of more good than harm entails a requirement that agencies be permitted to engage in "health-health" analysis where they see fit, ensuring that regulations do not create health problems more serious than those they are intended to alleviate.26 Certain policy responses to availability cascades will be found to fail health-health analysis. 266 
Finally, the "more good than harm" doctrine entails a mandate that, under the APA, agencies undergoing arbitrariness review should make a plausible showing that a regulation's costs are not grossly disproportionate to its benefits. We have said that our analysis makes a cognitive case for costbenefit analysis as a safeguard against socially destructive availability cascades. If availability and unavailability cascades can divert attention from important questions, then a broader reason exists for thinking that some form of cost-benefit analysis can do some good.267 it saved); NRDC v.

By way of summary, let us explore how the availability cascades discussed early in the article might have fared had the relevant institutional reforms been in place. The proposals that followed the terrorism-related concerns involving TWA 800268 are probably the easiest to reconsider in this light. Most would not have survived cost-benefit analysis. Studies probably would have shown that, in encouraging driving by raising the cost of flying, the proposals would not have enhanced overall safety and might well have harmed it.269 Our reforms would have had the same function as an earlier use of cost-benefit analysis, which tested a proposal to make young airplane passengers fly in their own child safety seats.270 In that case, cost-benefit analysis revealed that such a restriction would cost rather than save lives (by encouraging driving), and this finding helped defeat the proposal. 
The Alar case 271 could have been subjected to an analogous test. Peer review and cost-benefit analysis would have revealed the NRDC report to be vastly exaggerated, helping to alleviate the rapidly spreading fears. Perhaps by the time official investigations were completed and their findings publicized, the rapid cascade would already have forced apple growers to cease using Alar. However, government officials, relying on information from OIRA and the proposed Risk Information Center,2 72 could have provided more forceful reassurances than they actually did. In the Love Canal case, 273 a congressional risk oversight committee might well have restricted the size of Superfund. It could have shown that even if it is appropriate for the federal government to commit itself to cleaning abandoned hazardous waste dumps, devoting billions of taxpayer dollars to the cause was indefensible. 
The reforms we advocate would thus have protected society against legislative misallocations while offering the executive branch a greater role in priority-setting. The government would have been able to reallocate resources earmarked for abandoned hazardous waste dumps to more serious risks such as cancer and asthma. line, in ECONOMIC ANALYSES AT EPA, supra note 245, at 49 (demonstrating that cost-benefit analysis helped spur regulation of lead); James K.

In this article, we have tried to substantiate the following claims: lack reliable or first-hand knowledge. In such contexts, they assess probabilities with the help of the availability heuristic. Insofar as this heuristic influences the information that individuals store, retrieve, and process, it interacts with all other judgmental heuristics and with all cognitive biases that distort theirjudgments.

advance their causes, and they work to extend those already in progress. Acting selfishly or altruistically, they focus attention on isolated events, select information to support their preferred interpretations, and make anyone who questions their objectives appear ignorant, duped, or depraved. 
public opinion about the relative magnitudes of risks will exhibit multiple expressive equilibria. This implies the possibility of sudden shifts in public discourse on any given matter (as with the eruption of mass anxiety over toxic waste sites in the 1970s), inconsistencies across contexts (as with the huge attention paid to the dangers of Alar when more significant sources of risk, such as poor diet and insufficient exercise, received little attention), and discrepancies across countries at any given time (as with policies with respect to nuclear power, which is considered a much more serious threat in the United States than in Europe).

create formidable political pressures in support of wasteful and counterproductive regulations. These pressures might be mitigated by equipping the political system with "circuit breakers" to slow availability cascades and encourage the reconsideration of the demands they spawn. Without removing the right to select risk policies democratically, all three branches of government should be enabled to resist demands driven by misinformation about risks and to seek consistency among risk policies. 
Our starting point has been that people often lack relevant knowledge, even with respect to matters of great importance to them, and even if their convictions are intensely held. On matters ranging from the health consequences of sugar and coffee consumption to the risks of automobile driving, nuclear power, global warming, asthma, and thinning of the ozone layer, each of us depends for information on what other people seem to know, even as others are relying at least partly on us. We have sought to show how the availability heuristic interacts with informational and reputational motivations to create pervasively held social judgments rooted in cascades. 
Because people routinely use the availability heuristic in trying to make sense of reality, there is a danger of widespread and persistent misperceptions about risks. To be sure, an availability cascade that reshapes public discourse may be socially beneficial; the transformation can draw overdue attention to neglected problems. But there is no guarantee that the effects will be beneficial; socially damaging availability errors cannot be ruled out. A major challenge for any democratic system is to institute safeguards against harmful cascades. We have suggested that a modest but potentially appropriate response is to create disincentives against efforts to instigate mass scares by propagating knowing falsehoods. We have also suggested, less modestly, that each of the three branches of American government should be reformed in order to create protections against the adverse effects of availability cascades. Our analysis indicates that peer review and costbenefit analysis should be encouraged as checks against misperceptions rooted in interdependent learning and preference falsification. 
Availability cascades are by no means new, but modem communications enable them to gather momentum and overwhelm governments far more rapidly than was possible in the past. Fortunately, the very technologies responsible for this transformation present new tools for lessening the potential dangers. Most promisingly, a trusted Risk Information Site on the World Wide Web could make the latest information on a wide variety of hazards instantly available to anyone with access to a computer. This site would educate people not only on the magnitudes and characteristics of particular risks but also on discrepancies between private and public opinion about relevant controversies. 
A broader educational mission would be to disseminate information about the mechanics and implications of availability cascades. Insofar as people appreciate the mechanisms discussed here, they will know that public opinion can be both misinformed and deceptive. As Alexis de Tocqueville recognized, the notion that the majority is not necessarily right collides with one of the building blocks of modem democracy: the principle of majority 
A VA1LABILITY CASCADES rule.274 To ascribe moral authority to numbers is to instruct individuals that if they are outnumbered they are likely to be wrong and deserving of criticism. It is also to signal to the majority that it has a moral right to intimidate dissenters. As compared with people socialized to believe in the virtues of majority rule, those who understand the mechanics and consequences of availability cascades will be more resistant to their informational and reputational signals. 
Availability cascades can arise with respect to any issue on which large numbers of people have limited knowledge. Consider the controversy over reforming social welfare programs. Most Americans are uninformed about the details of these programs; few people know the percentage of welfare recipients who live in cities and how long beneficiaries generally remain on welfare. Whatever the merits of tightening welfare eligibility requirements, activists on all sides of the controversy help shape public discourse both by disseminating biased information and by vilifying their opponents. President Reagan, a master at using modem technologies to exploit people's use of the availability heuristic, played a leading role in reorienting public discourse on welfare, above all through sharp anecdotes that made honest taxpayers consider the system unfair; one such anecdote was the tale of the chauffeurdriven "welfare queen" who makes a fortune without working.27 5 President Reagan also succeeded in painting the supporters of welfare as "tax-andspend liberals" uninterested in promoting a sense of personal responsibility.276 
The debate preceding the Gulf War of 1991 provides another instructive example from national politics. People on both sides of the debate recognized that their cause would benefit by framing the issue appropriately and exploiting the availability heuristic. Pro-interventionists sought to raise the availability of images of the Korean War, which is widely believed to have inhibited the spread of communism; anti-interventionists reminded Americans of the Vietnam War, generally remembered as a death trap born out of miscalculation, ignorance, and self-serving exaggeration of the stakes involved.277

TIMES, June 23, 1987, at 13 (describing Reagan's campaign to make Congress look like a squanderer of money). 

The explosion of federal and state legislation to combat "hate crimes" offers another instructive example. This legislative campaign is being spearheaded by availability entrepreneurs who publicize major crimes against gays and ethnic minorities to paint a picture of a virulent "epidemic" of such crimes and to signal that the campaign's opponents show insensitivity to a horrible social problem.278 Their campaign for hate crimes legislation went into high gear in mid-1998 after a racially-motivated murder in Jasper, Texas. 279 Proponents argued that this murder confirms the persistence of racial violence and the need for extraordinary measures to combat the problem. Opponents of such legislation sought to use the same tragedy to demonstrate the lack of a need for special legislation. Jasper united in condemnation of the crime, they noted, and the police quickly caught the suspects. 280 
Salient news sometimes becomes the focus of availability campaigns designed to achieve political outcomes that would otherwise be unattainable. A coalition of celebrities used Princess Diana's death during a high-speed escape from tabloid journalists to make a case for stronger protections against invasions of their privacy. The leading availability entrepreneurs of this episode were the Screen Actors Guild and Senator Diane Feinstein; they tried to capitalize on the sympathy that this tragic death evoked by publicizing the dark side of tabloid journalism and vilifying tabloid journalists in order to catalyze an availability cascade in favor of new restrictions on media activities.2 1 
There are also groups that work to prevent potentially salient events capable of producing availability cascades inimical to their legislative agendas. In 1998, a group of Greek-Americans organized a campaign that induced a famous actor to give up the lead role in a high-budget film about the life of Mustafa Kemal Atatfirk, the founder of modem Turkey. 2 2 Even though the period when Atatfirk held Turkey's presidency is remembered as the golden age of modem Turkish-Greek relations, the campaigners, who condemned Atatiirk for actions they perceived as evil, feared the film would depict him favorably. 2 3 They also feared that a reverential portrayal in a major Hollywood production would improve popular feelings toward Turkey, which they considered a threat to Greek interests.2 4 One of their justifications was that the probable transformation of public opinion would alter the political bal278.

ance in Washington with regard to laws and policies of interest to the two mother countries and their ethnic communities in the United States.28S Another was that the film would influence legislative battles raging in many state and local governments over guidelines for teaching history.2 86 
Availability cascades are relevant not only to routine legislative struggles but also to the making and exercise of constitutional law. Consider first the matter of constitutional design. The rules for constitution-making and constitution-amending 2 7 provide safeguards against bad cascades. In particular, they call for extended deliberation to prevent rushed, myopic, or misinformed judgments. Proposed amendments succeed only by surviving a complex process of "peer review" by many people in various institutional settings.288 Like the rules that govern constitutional design, the checks and balances of the Constitution are designed to counteract the potentially destructive social forces that we have highlighted here.2 9 So understood, the prevailing constitutional limits to rapid decisionmaking hardly constitute undemocratic obstacles to implementation of the popular will. On the contrary, they are instruments to improve the workings of democracy in the light of the inescapable cognitive limitations of individual citizens and their susceptibility to social pressures. 2 0 
The courts are not immune to the social mechanisms examined in this article. Judges are subject to the availability heuristic, vulnerable to informational biases, and responsive to reputational incentives. All this leaves them open to the influences of availability cascades.291 Occasionally, a single legal decision-for example, Dred Scott v. Sandford,292 Plessy v. Ferguson,293 Lochner v. New York,294 Brown v. BoardofEducation,29s Roe v.

Wade296-comes to signal how an entire area of law should be understood. By virtue of the salience it acquires, it conveys a relatively simple moral or institutional lesson. For precisely this reason, individuals with strong views on a possible, pending, or actual legal decision try to show that it is, or could become, "another Lochner,.... another Brown," or "another Roe." Social struggles over the meaning of great legal cases should be understood in this light. 
Brown was exceedingly controversial in the late 1950s and early 1960s, 297 but its defenders put in motion an availability cascade that completed its course around 1980.298 Since that time, to say that Brown was misguided, or even to question its merits, has been to risk serious reputational damage, even ostracism from legal circles. Part of Brown's significance lies in its demonstrated power to trigger subsidiary availability cascades, such as those that have made discrimination on the basis of sex and alienage seem "like" racial segregation. 299 
The evolution of the American legal community's understanding of Roe v. Wade offers an example of concurrent and competing local availability cascades. In principle, Roe may be treated as either "another Brown" or "another Lochner." Through the mutually reinforcing reputational and informational mechanisms discussed here, large segments of the legal community have come to perceive it as "another Lochner." Within these circles, a defense of Roe triggers reputational sanctions. These circles co-exist with others, within which one incurs reputational punishments for challenging rather than defending Roe. Within each of these rival camps, perceptual interdependencies are clearly at work. Their members consider Roe right or wrong partly, if not largely, on the basis of what their co-members generally seem to believe. 00 As with Brown, the social forces at work have spillover effects in other areas. Roe's controversial status may have initiated a powerful availability cascade that predisposes judges not to extend constitutional protections to new rights claimed to be part of constitutionally protected privacy or liberty. It may even have helped make the Supreme Court less inclined to

the Supreme Court. As a result of these changes, litigants became more cautious in attempting to seek social engineering through constitutional law and, hence, less likely to claim that their case should be regarded as "another Brown."

processes highlighted here are not mutually exclusive. treat the "right" to physician-assisted suicide as a constitutional right, lest the judgment create "another Roe."30' 
Availability cascades can help or hinder the tasks of governance by shaping social norms and determining compliance levels. Behavioral research shows that changes in the availability of information about compliance with a prevailing norm often influence the extent to which it is followed. For instance, taxpayers are far more likely to comply with the prevailing tax laws if they believe that most people fulfil their tax obligations than if they think that noncompliance is widespread. 30 2 Another example is the problem of drinking on college campuses. Students who "binge drink" tend to overestimate the number of binge drinkers; when informed of the actual numbers, they are less likely to continue this self-destructive and socially harmful behavior.30 3 The tax evasion and binge drinking examples suggest that undesirable behaviors may be curbed simply by controlling the information available to the relevant actors, or alternatively, correcting the availability errors that contribute to the conduct. Each of these cases also shows that the availability of information about compliance levels affects behavior through two channels: by signaling what is socially acceptable and by providing clues as to one's own interests. Laws that have produced compliance with little or no enforcement, such as those that relegate smoking to designated areas and require people to clean up after their dog, have much to do with the informational and reputational mechanisms discussed above.3 °4 
Our arguments here constitute a challenge to both the economic analysis of law and branches of cognitive psychology that are beginning to influence legal scholarship.30 5 With few exceptions, economists have ignored critical interdependencies that govern people's preferences, choices, and beliefs; even the public choice school, which focuses on the sources of legislation, typically neglects the interdependencies at the heart of our argument here. Yet, as we have emphasized, there is no inherent conflict between the rational actor framework and the mechanisms that this article has high301. See Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702 (1997) (holding that assistance in committing suicide is not an interest protected by the Due Process Clause); Vacco v. Quill, 521 U.S. 793 (1997) (holding that a state's prohibiting assisting suicide does not violate the Equal Protection Clause).

lighted.30 6 Indeed, certain economists, along with legal scholars interested in economics, have derived valuable insights by recognizing that utilitymaximizing individuals are also social beings who care about status and look to others for knowledge. 30 7 For their part, cognitive psychologists have made large contributions to our understanding of information-processing mechanisms. But they have done so without examining how these cognitive mechanisms interact with the social construction, communication, and suppression of knowledge; and this tendency has carried over to the areas of legal scholarship that make use of cognitive psychology. 308
