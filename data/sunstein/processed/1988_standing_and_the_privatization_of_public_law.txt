STANDING  AND  THE  PRIVATIZATION  OF  PUBLIQ  LAW

Cass R.  Sunstein*

It is  ironic that  during  the  early  period of administrative  law,  doc-
trines  controlling  regulatory  agencies  were  built  directly  on  common-
that  administrative  regulation  was  self-consciously
law  principles 
designed  to  displace.'  Not until  the  1960s  did  courts,  in  concert  with
Congress,  begin to  develop  an independent  public law-a set of princi-
ples that  owed  their origin  not only  to  traditional  private  law,  but  also
to  the  ideas  that  gave  rise  to  administrative  regulation  in  the  first
place.2  At  their best,  the emerging  principles  revealed  an understand-
ing of the  functions  and malfunctions  of regulation,  the  potential  dan-
gers  of inaction  and  deregulation  as  well  as  overzealous  intervention,
the  risks  and  possibilities  of judicial  control,  the  appropriate  roles  of
politics  and  technical  sophistication  in  the  administrative  process,  and
the extent to which  regulatory  systems repudiated  the premises  of mar-
ket  ordering  that had  been  built into  common-law  principles. 3

The  last decade  has  seen  preliminary  signs of a countermovement,
with  courts  reorienting  administrative law  in  the  direction  of ideas  that
last appeared  in  the  initial  encounters  between  the judiciary  and  the
administrative  state. 4  Some  of those  signs  have  been  especially  con-

spicuous  in  the Supreme  Court's  standing  decisions. 5  Recent  and  still
quite  tentative  innovations  in  the law  of standing  have  started  to  push
legal  doctrine in  the direction  of what we may  call  a  private-law  model
of standing.  Under  this  model,  a  nineteenth  century  private  right  is  a
predicate  for judicial  intervention;  as  a  result, courts  may  not redress
the  systemic  or probabilistic  harms  that  Congress  intended  regulatory
schemes  to  prevent.

Not  fully  developed  until  the  New  Deal,  the  private-law  model
played  a  large  role  in  legal  doctrine  between  the  late  1930s  and  the
early  1960s.  The  principal  problem  with  that  model-widely  recog-
nized  in  the  1960s  and  1970s-was  that  it  distinguished  sharply  be-
tween  the legal  rights  of regulated  entities  on  the  one hand  and  those
of regulatory  beneficiaries  on  the other.  The  interests of regulated  in-
dustries could be protected  through the courts, whereas  the interests of
regulatory beneficiaries  were  to be vindicated  through  politics  or not at
all.

The  private-law  model  was  correctly  repudiated  in  a  series  of de-
velopments  culminating  in  the  1970s.  While  the model  is  often justi-
fied  by  reference  to  the case  or  controversy  requirement  of article  III,
there  is  in  fact no  basis  in  that  article  or  in  any  other  provision  of the
Constitution  for the view  that the private-law  model is  constitutional in
status.  For  purposes  of  standing,  the  principal  question  should  be
whether  Congress  has  created  a  cause  of action,  through  the Adminis-
trative  Procedure Act 6  (APA) or  otherwise,  not whether  the plaintiff is
able  to invoke  a  nineteenth  century  private  right.7  If the  law  were  re-
oriented  in  this  way,  existing doctrine would  be  greatly simplified;  and
a focus  on  congressional  enactments  would  reveal  that the Court's  cur-
rent approach has  resulted in  some decisions  denying  standing when it

Congress  did not usurp executive  prerogatives).  Some of these ideas retain  vitality.  See
Strauss,  Formal  and  Functional  Approaches  to  Separation-of-Powers  Questions-A
Foolish  Inconsistency?,  72  Cornell L. Rev. 488,496-502  (1987)  (defending the  result in
Bowsher and  the  continued  use  of separation  of powers  principles,  understood  in func-
tional  terms,  to  limit congressional  initiatives).

7.  There is  a  difference  between  the  principles  governing  standing  in  the  areas  of
administrative  and constitutional law-mosdy  because the APA creates  distinctive  stand-
ing doctrines  for review  of agency behavior  and  partly because efforts  to require admin-
istrative  agencies  to  comply  with  the  governing  statute  raise  considerations  different
from those raised by efforts  to require  Congress  or the executive  branch  to comply  with
the Constitution.  See infra  note  197.  For the most part, this  discussion focuses  on  prin-
ciples of standing in administrative  law, although constitutional principles  are frequently
introduced.

ought  to  have  been  granted,  and  others  granting  standing  when  it
ought  to  have  been  denied.

This Article is  organized  in  three parts.  Part I traces  the evolution
of modem standing  doctrine,  outlining  its original roots  in private law,
the  creation  of a  novel  set  of standing  limitations  in  response  to  the
New  Deal,  and the development  of an independent public law  of stand-
ing in  the  1960s  and  1970s.  Part II  discusses  the recent revival  of pri-
vate law  understandings  and  the principles  of separation  of powers  that
appear  to  underlie  that  revival.  Part  III  criticizes  the recent  develop-
ments,  describes  the appropriate  contours  of standing  requirements  in
administrative  law  cases,  and  concludes  with  a  discussion  of the  rela-
tionship  between  article  III  and  standing  doctrine.

I.  PRIVATE  LAW,  PUBLIC  LAW,  AND  THE  EVOLUTION

OF  STANDING  DOCTRINE

For most  of the  nation's  history,  there  was  no  distinctive  body  of
standing  doctrine.  Whether  there  was  standing  depended  on whether
positive law  created a cause  of action.8  In the modem period, however,
judicial review  of administrative action  has been  an  outgrowth of a  sim-
ple  framework.9  If administrators  intruded  on  interests  protected  at
common  law, judicial review was  available  to  test the question whether
there  was  statutory  authorization  for  what  would  otherwise  be  a  com-
mon-law wrong.  If no common-law  right were at stake, judicial  protec-
tion  was  unavailable.  The  most  distinctive  feature  of this  framework
was  the use of common-law  understandings  to define  the judicial role in
public-law  cases.

The  basic  framework  was  built  on  an  analogy  and  an  identifiable
underlying  theory.  The  analogy was  to private  law,  in which  the issues
of standing,  cause  of action,  and  the merits  are  closely  intertwined.  In
an action in which A  causes  an injury  to B, the question whether B  has a
cause  of action  overlaps  a  great  deal  with  the  question  whether  B  has
standing  and  whether  B  is  correct  on  the merits.  For  all  three  issues,
the question is whether A  has violated  a duty it owes  to B.  C, an affected
third party, generally  may not bring  suit when A  injures B-even if C is

9.  The discussion here draws onJ. Vining, supra note 1;  Stewart, supra note 1.  The
tradition  of prerogative  writs-most  notably  mandamus-provided  a  different  frame-
work,  one  that allowed  a variety  of actions  when  no common-law  right was at  stake.  See
infra note 19.  The existence of the writ  tradition, especially  at the origin of the republic,
makes  it extremely  awkward  to  suggest  that modern  notions  of injury  in  fact,  see  infra
notes  52-55  and accompanying  text, have  constitutional  status.  See Berger, supra  note
8; Jaffe,  supra  note 8;  Winter, supra  note  8.

materially  affected. 10  At  private  law,  there  is  no  need  for a  distinctive
set of principles  to  govern  standing.

In the early  period of administrative  regulation,  similar ideas  were
at work in public law. I I  A prospective  litigant could not bring suit if the
government  had  regulated,  or failed  to  regulate,  some  entity,  even  if
the interests  of the prospective  litigant had  been  substantially and  ma-
terially affected.  At  both private  and  public  law,  the question  was  not
whether  the litigant  was  harmed  or whether  the  governmental  or  non-
governmental defendant  acted unlawfully, but whether the government
breached  some  duty owed  to  the  litigant.  If the litigant  had  no  com-
mon-law  interest  at  stake-if  it  was  not  the  "object"  of  the  regula-
tion 12 -courts  saw  no legal  duty suitable for legal  redress.  Illegality  in
the  abstract  was  not  an  appropriate  concern  of the  courts.  Since  the
line between  legal injury  and injury in the abstract was  defined  by refer-
ence  to  the  common  law,  the  interests  of statutory  beneficiaries  were
invisible  as  far  as  the courts  were  concerned.

The  underlying  theory  was  based  on  notions  of social  contract.
When  citizens  entered  into  civil  society  from the  state  of nature,  they
did  so  with  certain  rights.' 3  The  state  could  not  interfere  with  those
rights  except  on a  showing  of collective  authorization  for  the interfer-
ence-legislative  action  combined  with  proper  executive  implementa-
tion.  The  relevant  category  of  interests  consisted  of  the  rights  of
private  property  and  liberty  that had  existed  in  the  state of nature.  If
no  such  interest  was  at  stake,  there  was  simply  no  predicate  for  legal
intervention.  Common-law  interests,  or traditional  private rights, were
thus  sharply  distinguished  from  statutory  benefits  for  purposes  of
standing.

It should be unsurprising  that this  framework operated  at the same
time  as-indeed  was  a  part  of-the  set  of ideas  associated  with  the
Lochner era.1 4  When  the  Supreme  Court  invalidated  social  and  eco-
nomic  regulation  associated  with  the  progressive  and  New  Deal  peri-
ods,  it  did  so  by  invoking  common-law  categories  in  order  to  test the

10.  An  exception  is  the  third-party  beneficiary  doctrine  in  contract  law.  See  E.

Farnsworth,  Contracts  §  10.5  (1982).

11.  Inroads  on  the  framework  began  in  The  Chicago Junction  Case,  264  U.S.  258
(1924)  (allowing  standing  for competing  carriers  to  challenge  acquisition  approval  by
ICC),  though  the  private-law  understanding  played  a large  role  until  the  1960s.  See
infra notes  26-67  and  accompanying  text.

12.  The  understanding  of who  is  an  object  of regulation  turns  on  an  antecedent
baseline-the  nineteenth  century  common  law-establishing  the  ordinary  or  natural
functions  of government.  Under an  alternative  baseline,  however,  any  beneficiary  left
unprotected  by  government might  be treated  as an  object  of the  inadequate  protection.
See  Sunstein,  Lochner's  Legacy,  87 Colum.  L. Rev.  873  (1987)  (discussing  role of base-
lines  in  standing  and  other areas  of public  law);  infra  notes  61-63  and  accompanying
text.  For a  defense  of the  old  view,  see  Scalia,  supra  note 5,  at  887  & n.28.

validity  of public law. 15  Intrusions  on common-law  interests,  or depar-
tures  from common-law  principles,  were  thought to require  special jus-
tification;  by  contrast,  adherence  to  the  common  law  was  seen  as
unobjectionable  neutrality.  The  use  of common-law  notions,  sharply
distinguishing  between  statutory  benefits  and  nineteenth  century  pri-
vate  rights,  was  the  central  mark  of  the jurisprudence  of the  Lochner
period.1 6

In the context of standing, this view  had two  principal implications.
First,  regulated  entities-industries  and  others  who  were  the  object  of
regulation-had  access  to  court  to  challenge  agency  action  as  unlaw-
fully  infringing  on  their common-law  rights.  In  such  cases,  there  was
no problem of standing.  Regulated  entities  were usually in  the position
of actual  or prospective  defendants,  and  there was  little  doubt that de-
fendants  had  standing  to  resist  coercive  governmental  action-a  view
with  constitutional foundations.1 7  Second,  the interests  of competitors
and  regulatory  beneficiaries1 8  were not legally  cognizable. t 9  Those  in-
terests,  treated  as  privileges  or  legal  gratuities,  were  to  be  vindicated
through  the political process  or not at all.  We  may describe  the result-
ing  framework-an  ambiguous  amalgam  of federal  common  law,  statu-
tory  construction,  and  constitutional  law-as  a  private-law  model  of
public  law.

Another,  quite  different  idea  was  at  work  here  as  well.  Many
judges who  were hospitable  toward  administrative regulation  sought  to
develop  devices  to minimize legal  or judicial  intrusions  into  the  regula-

15.  See generally L. Tribe, American  Constitutional  Law  §  1-3,  at 5,  §  1-4,  at 76-77
(2d ed.  1988)  (describing the Lochner-era "belief that property  and its  contractually  real-
izable  advantages were attributable  to some natural order to things implicit in  a revealed
structure  of common-law  rights");  Sunstein,  supra note 12,  at 879  (common law  formed
"baseline  from which  to measure  deviations  from neutrality,  or self-interested  'deals'  ").

16.  See Sunstein,  supra  note  12,  at 874.
17.  See  Yakus  v. United  States,  321  U.S. 414  (1944).
18.  Competitors and  beneficiaries  were considered  to be  "bystanders,"  an idea  that
depended  on an assortment  of unarticulated  substantive conclusions.  But the character-
ization  of a  claim  as  that  of a bystander  operates  as  a  conclusion  or an  epithet  rather
than as an  analytical  device.  There  is no  prepolitical  or prelegal  way  to  decide  who is  a
bystander;  the term is a function  of law, not of anything  in  the world that is independent
of  the  legal  system.  See  Havens  Realty  Corp.  v.  Coleman,  455  U.S.  363,  373  (1982)
(indicating  that statute  may  create  an  injury where  none  existed  before).

19.  See, e.g.,  Alabama  Power  Co.  v.  Ickes,  302  U.S.  464, 479-80  (1938)  (competi-
tors).  An  exception  here  can  be found in  the  law of mandamus.  As a  historical  matter,
mandamus  remedies  quite  generally  permitted  suits  to compel  government  action.  See
L. Jaffe,  Judicial  Control  of Administrative  Action  468-69  (1965).  But  the  Supreme
Court  ruled  in  an  early  case  that federal  courts  do  not  have  general  authority  to issue
writs  of mandamus,  McIntire v.  Wood,  11  U.S.  (7  Cranch)  503,  504  (1813),  and  in  any
case,  mandamus  could  not  control  discretionary  decisions.  See Wilbur v.  United States
ex  rel.  Kudrie, 281  U.S.  206,  218  (1930);Jarrett  v.  Resor,  426 F.2d  213,  216  (9th Cir.
1970).  Note,  however,  that such  rulings were  interpretations  of positive  law,  and  there-
fore  of congressional  intent,  not  of article  III.

tory  process. 2 0  This  development  was  a  conspicuous  part  of the  New
Deal  attack  on  legalism  and  the judiciary.  That attack  had  substantive
and institutional  dimensions.  The substantive  dimension  consisted  of a
belief that the nineteenth  century  catalogue  of common-law  rights  was
hardly natural;  instead,  it was  a  controversial  regulatory  system.  In  the
view  of the  New  Deal  reformers,  the  common  law  was  inadequate  as
such  because  it  was  excessively  protective  of property  rights,  insuffi-
ciently  protective  of  the  disadvantaged,  and  ill-adapted  to  economic
welfare  in  an  integrated  national economy. 2 1  The institutional  dimen-
sion  consisted  of an attack  on the judicial  system  in favor of regulatory
agencies,  which  were  to  be  democratically  controlled,  technically  ex-
pert,  self-starting,  and  free  of the  traditional  constraints  of adjudica-
tion.  Taken  in  concert,  these  ideas  provided  much  of the  impetus  for
administrative  regulation. 2 2

Against  this  background,  courts  favorably  disposed  toward  the
New  Deal  reformation  developed  doctrines  of standing,  ripeness,  and
reviewability  largely to insulate agency  decisions from judicial interven-
tion. 23  Such doctrines  were  used enthusiastically  by judges  associated
with  the  progressive  movement  and  the  New  Deal,  most  prominently
Justices  Brandeis  and  Frankfurter,  who  reflected  the  prevailing  belief
that  traditional  conceptions  of the  rule of law  were  incompatible  with
administrative  regulation. 24  In  this  view,  the  interests  supporting  the

20.  See  Joint  Anti-Fascist  Refugee  Comm.  v.  McGrath,  341  U.S.  123,  154-55
(1951)  (Frankfurter, J.,  concurring)  (upholding  agency  action  by  denying  standing  in
part because challenged action was not final); Ashwander v.  Tennessee Valley  Auth., 297
U.S.  288,  341-45  (1936)  (Brandeis, J.,  concurring)  (upholding  agency's  dealings  with
corporation by denying standing to corporate stockholders); cf. Fairchild v. Hughes,  258
U.S.  126,  129-30  (1922)  (dismissing prospective challenge  to constitutional  amendment
and  its  enforcement  by  attorney  general,  by  denying  standing  to  plaintiff);  Wilson  v.
Shaw,  204  U.S.  24,  30-31  (1907)  (upholding  agency  action,  in  part  because  injunctive
relief is  inappropriate  remedy  to protect  citizen  against wrongful  government act).  No-
tably,  in McGrath, Ashwander, and  other cases,  a  majority  of the  Supreme  Court  rejected
the Brandeis-Frankfurter  position and  allowed standing in cases that plausibly amounted
to  taxpayer  suits.  These  and  other  aspects  of the  development  of standing limitations
are  illuminatingly  discussed  in  Winter, supra  note  8.

One of the most influential achievements  of A. Bickel,  The Least  Dangerous Branch
(1962),  was  to  generalize  the  Brandeis-Frankfurter  position  on  standing,  to  remove  it
from its  context,  and  to give it a life  entirely independent  of New  Deal  concerns.  Id.  at

has  enjoyed a  kind  of renaissance  in  recent  years,  though  from judges
with  a  quite  different political  orientation.

The private-law  model  of standing  thus  reflected  a  confluence  of
two  sets  of ideas,  both closely  associated  with  the Lochner era  and  the
New  Deal  attack  on  the jurisprudence  of Lochner.  The  first,  prominent
in  Lochner itself, was  that  the judiciary  existed  largely  to  protect  com-
mon-law  interests  from  governmental  incursions.  The  common  law
formed  the baseline  from which  courts  distinguished  between  govern-
ment  inaction  and  action  or  neutrality  and  partisanship.  For this  rea-
son,  intrusions  on  common-law  rights,  and  not  on  other  sorts  of
interests,  served  to  trigger judicial protection.  The  second  idea-a  re-
action  against Lochner on the part of those hospitable  to the administra-
tive  state-was  that  doctrines  of justiciability,  including  standing,
should  be  designed  to  minimize  the  occasions  for judicial  intervention
into  the regulatory  process.

The  advocates  of judicial  control,  hostile  to  administrative  regula-
tion,  saw  no  need  for judicial  intervention  in  order  to  safeguard  the
interest  in  regulatory  protection.  And  in  light  of the  recent  history,
those favorable  to regulation were  highly suspicious  of the courts.  The
idea  that  courts  might  intervene  to  protect  regulatory  beneficiaries
from a recalcitrant agency was  entirely foreign  to  their experience.  As a
result,  there  was  mutual  agreement  on  the  private-law  model  from
those who  believed  in  the  need for  a  continuing  role for  the legal  sys-
tem  in  supervising  administrative  regulation,  and  those  who  thought
that  adjudicative  controls  were  to  a  large  degree  anachronistic.  The
consequence  of the convergence  of these ideas was  that those without  a
common-law  interest were  unable  to  seek judicial  relief.  At  the  time, it
was  unclear whether  this framework  was  rooted in federal  common  law
or statutory  construction-or  instead  whether it amounted  to  a largely
revisionist  reading  of article  111.26

In two  basic  steps, courts abandoned  this  model.  The  first was  the
conclusion  that interests protected  by statute were also judicially  cogni-
zable.2 7  If the interest of a prospective  litigant in freedom  from  compe-

ing  based  on  provisions  of Transportation  Act  and Judicial  Code).  It  may  have  been
thought here  that competition  among  the objects of regulation,  including monitoring of
compliance  with  regulation,  would  ultimately serve  to  protect  the  public  as a  whole.

tition  was  a  factor  made  relevant  by  the  governing  statute-if  the
agency was  required by  law  to  take that factor  into account  in deciding
the merits-the litigant would  have access  to  court in order to vindicate
its interest.28  In such a  case,  the litigant  would not have  to  show that a
common-law  interest  was  at  stake.

The  second  step  was  the  recognition  of "surrogate  standing,"  by
which  Congress  could allow  certain  plaintiffs  to  bring  suit to  vindicate
the  claims  of the  public  at large  even  though  they  did  not  themselves
have  a  statutorily  protected  interest.  This  principle  applied  when  an
organic  statute  granted standing to  anyone  "who  is aggrieved  or whose
interests are adversely  affected." 2 9  Thus, for example, competitors  of a
radio  station  would  have  standing  to  protect  the interests  of listeners
under  the FCC  statute.3 0

Under  this  framework,  it  was  not  always  necessary  for  Congress
expressly  to  confer a  right  to bring  suit on  the plaintiff.  The  existence
of an  interest  protected  by  statute  was  sufficient.  Courts  treated  the
congressional  desire  to  protect a  statutory  interest  as  an  implicit  grant
of a  right  to  bring  suit.  The  requirements  for  an  implicit  cause  of ac-
tion  were  thus  quite  lenient.31

Moreover,  the  existence  of an  interest  protected  at  common  law
was  sufficient  to  confer  standing,  even  if there  was  no  particular  evi-
dence  of congressional  intent to  allow  the  action  to  go  forward.  This
conclusion reflected  a background  understanding, not traceable to  stat-
ute,  that  the  objects  of regulation  should  ordinarily  be  permitted  to
raise  the question  whether  there  was  legal  authorization  for  intrusion
on common-law  interests.  This understanding,  part  of the private-law
model  and emphasized  in the New Deal period, was  probably  a product
of a  constitutional  concern.  If those  seen  as  the  objects  of regulation
were  prohibited from seeking judicial  review  to protect liberty  or prop-

cause of action  for damages  under  section 215  of Investment Advisors Act  of 1940).  It
may be possible to explain  this  difference in standards  by reference  to the  nature of the
remedies  being sought.  Suits brought  under the  APA attempt  to nullify  administrative
action;  implied  causes  of  action  are  frequently  damage  actions.  This  explanation  fits
well  with  Transamerica, in which  the  Court  implied  an  equitable  remedy  for rescission,
but refused  to permit  a  damage  action  to  go  forward.  Transamerica, 444  U.S.  at  18-24.

erty interests  against unauthorized  executive  action,  a serious  constitu-
tional  question  would be  raised under both the due  process  clause and
article  111.32

In contrast,  no similar question was  thought to be raised by  a mea-
sure  preventing  statutory  beneficiaries  from  seeking  judicial  relief.
Their interests were legal  gratuities."3  In  the modern  period, however,
serious  constitutional  problems  might  also  be  raised  by  congressional
efforts  to  deny  standing  to  those  seeking  governmental  assistance  in
preventing  illegality  by  third  parties.3 4

Despite  these complications,  there was  in this  period a close associ-
ation  between  the existence  of an implied  cause of action and  the exist-
ence  of  standing.  The  question  of  standing  turned  on  whether
Congress  had  explicitly  or  implicitly  granted  the  plaintiff  a  right  to
bring suit, at least if the notion  of implicit  grant is understood  with  the
foregoing  qualifications.35  That question was  in  turn informed  largely
by  background  understandings  about the  circumstances  in  which judi-
cial  relief should  be  available.

In  1946,  Congress  codified  the various  bases for standing outlined
above  in  section  702  of the APA:  "A  person  suffering  legal wrong  be-
cause  of agency  action,  or  adversely  affected  or  aggrieved  by  agency
action  within  the meaning  of a  relevant  statute,  is  entitled  to judicial
review  thereof."a  The  reference  to legal  wrong was  meant  to  include

largely anachronistic.  See infra notes 62-63 and accompanying  text.  In this respect,  the
constitutional  questions raised by  a denial  ofjudicial  review  and a  denial of standing are
quite similar.  See Fallon,  supra note 32, at 963-67;  cf. Logan v. Zimmerman  Brush Co.,
455 U.S.  422, 430-31  (1982)  (discussing "new  property"  cases  putting statutory benefits
on  the same  footing as  common-law  interests).  Consider also  the idea  that under mod-
em law,  a "separate  indication of congressional  intent to make agency action  reviewable
under the APA is not  necessary; instead,  the rule is  that the cause  of action  for review  of
such  action  is  available  absent  some  clear  and  convincing  evidence  of legislative  inten-
tion  to preclude  review."  Japan  Whaling  Ass'n  v.  American  Cetacean  Soc'y, 478  U.S.

A central flaw  in Hart, supra  note 32,  is its dependence  on an  anachronistic  distinc-
tion between  coercive  and noncoercive  governmental  action.  Id. at  1383.  Hart suggests
that whether  there is a constitutional right to judicial  review  depends on whether  or not
the  government  is  acting  coercively,  and  he defines  coercion  by  reference  to common-
law  categories.  Id. at  1387-1401.  But  in  the  post-New  Deal  era,  such  ideas  cannot  be
sustained.  Indeed,  reliance  on  pre-New  Deal  understandings  of legal  rights  pervades
Hart's  dialogue.

harm  to common-law,  statutory,  and constitutional  interests;  in the set-
ting of administrative  law,  the first two  were by  far the most important.
The  "adversely  affected  or aggrieved"  language  was  designed  to  allow
for  surrogate  standing if the organic  statute  provided  such standing. 37
There  was  no  clear  indication,  in  the  text  or  history  of  the  APA,
whether  and  when  the beneficiaries  of regulation  might  have  standing
to  vindicate  legal  requirements 3 8-though 
they  too  could  easily  be
thought  to  suffer from a legal  injury in  the form of harm to  their  statu-
torily  protected  interests.

In  the  1960s,  courts  interpreted  the statutorily  protected  interest
aspect  of the legal-wrong  test  in  order  to  reach  precisely  this  conclu-

injury-in-fact  standard  like  that subsequently  adopted  in Association  of Data Processing
Serv.  Orgs.,  Inc. v.  Camp, 397  U.S.  150,  152-53  (1970).  The text and history  of the APA
suggest  that  it  was  intended  instead  to  incorporate  the  framework  deicribed  above,
supra  text accompanying notes  27-35.  For  this reason,  the treatment in Davis,  The Lib-
eralized  Law  of Standing,  37  U.  Chi.  L.  Rev. 450,  452-53  (1970),  is  off  the  mark.

37.  The  legislative  history  of  the  APA  is  not  clear,  but  it  tends  to  confirm  this

reading.

The  phrase  "legal  wrong"  means  such  a wrong as  is specified  in  section  10(e).
It  means  that  something  more  than  mere  adverse  personal  effect  must  be
shown  in  order  to  prevail-that  is,  that  the  adverse  effect  must  be an  illegal
effect.  Almost  any  governmental  action  may  adversely  affect  somebody-as
where  rates  or prices  are  fixed-but  a  complainant,  in  order  to  prevail,  must
show  that  the  action  is  contrary  to law  in either substance  or procedure.

Doc.  No.  248,  79th  Cong.,  2d  Sess.  276  (1946)  [hereinafter  APA  Leg.  History].  It  is
notable  in  this  regard  that  the drafters  of the APA  expressly  conflate  the issue  of stand-
ing with  the merits.  Id. at 212;  see also  id. at 368-69  (agencies  "may  not willfully  act or

the  "adjective  'legal'  is  a  limiting  adjective").

Consider also  the  analysis  in the highly influential  report  of the  Attorney General's

Committee  on Administrative  Procedure:

The standing may  be conferred  by  statute;  but  it frequently  is not so  conferred
in  specific  terms.  The  question  is  then  whether  the  person  has  otherwise  a
private  right  not  to have  the  administrative  body  act  in  the  allegedly  unlawful
manner....  Whether  a particular person  shall have  the  right to contest admin-
is  a  question of law  and  policy  dependent  on  a  number  of

variable  factors.  Consideration, though  not conclusive,  has been  given,  for ex-
ample,  to  the  nature  and  extent  of the  person's  interest,  and  the  character  of
the  administrative  act,  whether  it  commands  conduct  by  the  person,  permits
conduct  by  his  rival,  withholds  a  service  or  benefit  which  the  Government  is
free  to  withhold,  and so forth....  Except in  special cases,  when special  consid-
erations  require  a contrary holding,judicial review within the usual limits is appropri-
ate  whether the  applicant seeks  protection of a  constitutional right or  of a  statutory or
common-law  right, privilege, or bounty.

sion, allowing regulatory beneficiaries  to vindicate  claims  of administra-
tive  illegality.  Thus,  for  example,  viewers  of  television,  victims  of
housing  discrimination,  and  users  of  the  environment  were  able  to
bring  suit  because  their  interests  were  statutorily  protected.3 9  This
conclusion  was  a  natural  and  unsurprising  interpretation  of the  legal-
wrong  test,  since  beneficiaries,  at least as  clearly  as  competitors,  were
intended to be protected by regulatory  statutes.40  Here  too there was  a
connection  between  the  question  of standing  and  the  existence  of an
implied  cause  of action; the existence  of a  statutorily protected  interest
was  thought to  create a legal wrong under the APA. 4 1  The existence  of
a  common-law  interest  became  a  sufficient  but not  a  necessary  condi-
tion  for legal  protection.4 2  Eventually,  the law  no longer distinguished
sharply  between  the  interests  of regulatory  beneficiaries  and  those  of
regulated  industries.

The shift of the  1960s and  1970s was  attributable  to a general  con-
sensus  that, from the standpoint of the New Deal  period, was  quite puz-
zling.  According  to  the  emerging  view,  a  belief in  the rule  of law  was
entirely  compatible  with  a  system  of administrative  regulation.  Legal
controls  on regulatory  agencies  seemed  well adapted  to  or even  neces-
sary  for  the  successful  implementation  of statutory  programs.  Judges
and  others  who  rejected  common-law  baselines  in  general  were  thus
well  disposed toward legal  intervention.  In their rejection  of the  use  of

40.  See  cases  cited  supra  note 39.
41.  Without  the APA,  this conclusion  might  have been  controversial. The existence
of an interest protected by statute need not imply a correlative  right to bring an  action to
vindicate  that interest.  Some  of the recent cases  involving implied  causes  of action  make
this  point dear.  See  cases  cited  supra  note 31.

42.  The  development  of the  law here  thus  replicated  the shifting  definition  of lib-
erty  and  property  interests  during the  same period.  Originally  those  interests  were  de-
fined  by reference  to the common  law.  In  the late  1960s  and  1970s,  however,  statutorily
protected  interests  assumed  constitutional  status.  See  Perry  v.  Sindermann,  408  U.S.
593,  599-603  (1972)  (professor's interest  in position  under de  facto  tenure program  is

quires  that welfare recipient  be afforded  evidentiary  hearing  before  benefits  can be  ter-
minated).  Here  too, courts  made  inroads  on a  private-law  model of public  law, and  for
many of the same  reasons.  The  distinction between  common-law  and statutory interests
does,  however,  persist  in  other  areas  of  the  law.  See  Commodity  Futures  Trading
Comm'n  v.  Schor, 478  U.S. 833,  854  (1986)  (noting that existence  of interest  protected

common-law  baselines  in  the  law  of standing,4 3  they  were  conforming
to the understandings  that gave  rise to  regulation in the first  place; but
the new synthesis  reflected  a firm rejection  of the New  Deal belief in  an
inevitable  disjunction between  the realm of law  and the realm  of admin-
istrative  government.  The  consequence  Was  that judicial  checks  be-
came  a  significant  part  of  the  network  of  controls  on  administrative
behavior,  controls  that  were  designed  to  promote  as  well  as  to  check
regulatory  intervention. 44

Three particular  ideas  played a  role in  this  shift.  The  first  was  an
understanding  that congressional  purposes  could  be  defeated  not only
by  overzealous  regulation,  but  also  by  unlawful  failure  to  regulate  or
agency  hostility  to  statutory  programs. 45  If conformity  to  law  was  a
goal  of administrative  law,  there was  no  reason  to  distinguish  between
the beneficiaries  and  the  targets  of regulation.  Far from being  incom-
patible with the administrative  process,  some measure  ofjudicial  super-
vision appeared  to be a means  of promoting  agency fidelity to statutory
purposes.

The second  idea derived from widespread  (though not monolithic)
evidence  of the  influence  of regulated  industries  over  regulatory  pro-
grams. 4 6  In  the face  of such  evidence,  it was  most  peculiar to  suggest

43.  These  baselines  were  rejected  elsewhere  as  well.  See J.  Vining,  supra  note  1;

Stewart,  supra  note  1;  Sunstein,  supra  note  2.

44.  The  idea  of what  sort  of government  action  represents  "regulatory  interven-
tion"  requires  an antecedent  baseline  establishing  the ordinary  or desirable functions  of
government.

45.  The point  had  been  recognized  long before:
From  the point  of view of public  policy and  public  interest, it is  important  not
only  that  the  administrator  should not  improperly  encroach  on  private  rights
but also that he should effectively  discharge  his statutory obligations.  Excessive
favor of private interest may  be as prejudicial  as excessive encroachment....  A
Federal  Trade Commission  may  violate  the legislative policy and  cause harm to
private  interests by  failing to investigate  and  detect  unfair methods of competi-
tion  as  well  as  by  overzealously  condemning  fair methods.

Yetjudicial review  is rarely  available, theoretically  or practically,  to compel
effective  enforcement  of the law  by  the administrators.  It  is adapted  chiefly  to
curbing  excess  of power,  not  toward  compelling  its exercise.
Att'y Gen.  Rep.,  supra  note  37,  at  76.  The  report  goes  on  to  note:

[T]he  problem  of whether  the  administrator's  refusal  to  take  action  is  review-
able  still remains....  In some instances  review  may  be unavailing  because  the
determination  of whether  or  not  action  should  be  taken  in  the  circumstances
may have  been  committed  to the  exclusive judgment  of the  administrator  as to
the  public interest and  convenience.  But  if the denial is based on an erroneous inter-
pretation of law, judicial review is  available to  remove at least that barrier.

that regulated  industries,  and not regulatory  beneficiaries,  should have
access  to  court.  Political  remedies were  no more obviously  available  to
regulatory  beneficiaries  than  to  regulated  entities;  indeed,  the  benefi-
ciaries  faced  especially  severe  problems  of political  organization. 4 7  If
an  agency  failed  to  implement  a  statutory  program  to  the  legally  re-
quired  degree, it was  often  unrealistic to  expect  the political process  to
provide relief. In any case,  the possible availability of political  remedies
was  not  thought  to  be  a reason  to  deny  standing  to  regulated  entities.
In  both  cases, judicial  review  was  a  means  of promoting  agency  con-
formity  to  the commands  of the legislative  process.

The final idea  was  that from the standpoint  of the legal system,  the
claims  of regulatory  beneficiaries  were  of no less importance  than  those
of regulated  industries.  The  interests  of victims  of discrimination,  pol-
lution,  unfair  labor  practices,  securities  fraud,  and  other  statutory
harms  seemed no  less  deserving  of legal protection  than  the common-
law  interests  that had served  as  the traditional  predicate for judicial  re-
view.  This  conclusion  was  a  natural-indeed  inevitable-  outgrowth  of
the New Deal, which  arose from a belief that the common-law  catalogue
of interests  was  inadequate.48

The  conclusion  that  statutory  and  common-law  interests  should
not  be  sharply  distinguished  seemed  irresistible  if importance  was  as-
sessed by reference  to  the beliefs  of Congress,  which,  after all,  created
the  statutory  programs.  The  limitation  of  standing  to  those  having
traditional  common-law  interests  at  stake  appeared  to  depend  on  an
anachronistic  conception  of legal  rights  traceable  above  all  to  the  dis-
credited jurisprudence  of Lochner v.  New  York. 4 9  The  attack  on  com-
mon-law  baselines  thus  merged  with  an  attack  on  the  belief  that
administrative  autonomy  was  the most  promising  institutional  mecha-
nism  for producing  the appropriate  level  of regulatory  control.

It would have  been possible  for  courts  to  use these  ideas  to  build
on  the legal-wrong  test in such  a way  as  to grant statutory  beneficiaries
broad  standing  to bring  suit.  Because  regulatory  programs  quite  gen-
erally,  and indeed by definition,  reflect  a desire to protect  beneficiaries,
allegations  of inadequate  regulatory  action  might always  be  thought  to
create  a liegal wrong, and therefore  standing, within the meaning  of the

APA. 50  This conclusion,  in fact reached  in many  lower court decisions
in  the  1960s, 51  would  have  had  the advantage  of promoting  fidelity  to
the text and purposes  of the governing  provision of the APA.  It would
also  have  tied  the  problem  of standing  to  the  question  whether  Con-
gress  had  explicitly  or implicitly  conferred  on plaintiffs  a right to  bring
suit.

The  Supreme  Court,  however,  took  a  different  route  to  the  revi-
sion of standing  doctrine.  In its decision  in Association of Data Processing
Service Organizations v.  Camp,5 2 the Court abandoned  the previous  frame-
work  altogether, signalling  a significant  departure from the private-law
underpinnings  of previous  law.  The  Court  replaced  the legal  interest
test with a factual inquiry  into  the existence  of harm;  the existence  of a
interest  was  utterly  irrelevant. 53  What  was  relevant  was
"legal" 
whether there was  an  injury in fact  that was  "arguably  within the zone"
of interests  protected  by  the statutory  or  constitutional  provision  at is-
sue.5 4  The  Court therefore interpreted  the APA to  grant standing even
if the particular  substantive statute did not confer on plaintiffs a right to
bring  suit and  indeed  even  if there  was  no  legal  interest  at all.5 5

The  "arguably  within  the  zone  of  interests"  requirement  re-
sponded  to  some of the same  concerns  as  the legal-interest  test, and  it
too called for a degree  of entanglement between  standing and the mer-
its; but the requirement was,  by design, quite  lenient, and involved only
a brief examination  of the statute  to  see if the plaintiff's  interests  were
entirely  far  afield  from  the  statutory  purposes. 56  Notably,  however,
Data Processing was  styled  as  an  interpretation  of the  APA.  As  such,  it

50.  There  is evidence  that those responsible for the APA contemplated  standing on
the  part  of  regulatory  beneficiaries.  The  influential  and  contemporaneous  Attorney
General's  Committee  noted  that judicial  review  "is  adapted  chiefly  to  curbing  excess  of
power, not  toward  compelling  its exercise."  Att'y Gen.  Rep., supra  note 37,  at 76.  But
it added  that "if  the denial[of action] is based on an erroneous interpretation of law, judicial review
is  available to  remove at least  that barrier."  Id.  at 86;  see  also  supra  note  37  (legislative
history  of APA).  Note also  that  the APA  defines  "agency  action"  to include  "failure  to
act,"  5  U.S.C.  § 551(13)(1982),  and  authorizes  courts  to  "compel  agency  action  unlaw-
fully  withheld  or  unnecessarily  delayed," 
Id.  § 706(1).  The  contrary  position  is
presented in Scalia, supra note 5,  at 887-88,  but the position is  insufficiently attentive  to
the context  and history of the APA.  Cf. Heckler v.  Chaney, 470  U.S. 821,  828-35  (1985)
(holding agency inaction presumptively  unreviewable,  but apparently  allowing  review to
overcome  errors  of law).

tent with  the  purposes implicit in  the statute  that it  cannot reasonably  be assumed  that

for failure  to  meet  the  "arguably  within  the  zone"  test.

was  incorrect; 57  but in  actual  effect,  it could be interpreted  so as  not to
depart  substantially  from  the original  APA  framework. 58

Data Processing responded  to a  belief that the private-law  model  no
longer  worked  in  public-law  cases. 59  Why this  is  so  is  a  complex  mat-
ter.6 0  A principal  reason was  that  the private-law  inquiry  into  whether
A  has  violated a  duty owed  to B does  not quite  capture  the dynamics  of
public-law  cases,  in which  disputes  cannot  so  readily be  understood  in
terms  of clear  rights  and  duties.  Often  administrative  disputes  do not
have  a  bipolar  structure:  there  may  be  many  people  on  one  or  both
sides  of the dispute,  and the agency  may be  authorized  to  consider  nu-
merous  factors,  no  one  of which  is  controlling.  Since  a number of fac-
tors  are  relevant,  and  none  decisive,  the  right-duty  relationship
between  the  government  and  any  particular  legal  complainant  is  not
crisp  and bilateral.  It is  important  not to  overstate  this  point.  In  pub-
lic-law  cases,  there  are  rights  and  duties  too.  The  failure  to  consider  a
relevant  factor,  or the consideration  of an irrelevant  factor,  might well
be  thought of as a breach of a legal duty owed by the government to the
complainant.  But  the  inquiry  into  consideration  of  relevant  factors
does  not  have  a  clear  parallel  in  private-law  actions.

Moreover,  once  public-law  plaintiffs  are  authorized  to  appear  in
court, they do not argue  that the government  has breached  a duty owed
to  them-at  least  not  in  the  common-law  sense-but  instead  that  the
government  has  behaved  unlawfully. 61  In  this  respect,  public  law  has
for  a  long time  split  the  question  of standing  and  the  merits.

Even  under Data Processing, there  remained  a  bow  in  the direction
of dispute-settlement,  for  the  requirement  of an  injury  in  fact  elimi-
nated  those  plaintiffs  with  purely  ideological  claims. 62  But  the  Court
moved  dramatically  in  the  direction  of  a  standing  doctrine  that  no

ing with  grant implied by legislative history of APA);  supra  notes 36-37  and accompany-
ing  text  (legislative history  of APA).

58.  This  is because  the injury-in-fact test was designed and  interpreted  largely so as
to allow standing, not for all those "affected,"  but for competitors and  regulatory benefi-
ciaries.  This  test in substance  replicated  the expansion  of the  legally protected  interest
model  in the  late  1960s  and early  1970s,  which  built on the  legal-wrong  standard  repu-
diated in Data Processing.  See  supra  notes  38-42  and  accompanying  text.

scope  of constitutional right at stake).  There are, however,  prudential  limitations on the
ability  of one  person  to raise  the  interests  of another.  See  generally  Monaghan,  Third

62.  Here  as elsewhere  a standard  is  necessary  to explain  what a purely  ideological
claim  is.  There is  no prelegal  category  of ideological  claims;  to say that  a  claim is  ideo-
logical  is  to say  that no  legal  right is at stake.  That question will  depend  in  turn  on the
substantive  law.  See infra  notes 205-32  and  accompanying  text (discussing article  III).

longer owed  its shape  to  common-law  categories,  or  distinguished  be-
tween  the rights  of regulated  entities  and  regulatory  beneficiaries.

Indeed-and  this  is  the  central  point-that  very  distinction  de-
pended on a conceptual  foundation  that had become anachronistic  pre-
cisely  because  it  was  dependent  on  common-law  baselines.  Whether
someone is the object  of regulation or its beneficiary  cannot be  decided
without an independent  theory outlining what  it is  that-govemment  or-
dinarily or properly  does.  Regulated  entities are themselves  the benefi-
ciaries  of statutory  limits  on  agency power-and  of the common  law-
insofar  as  those  sources  of law  protect  them  from  public or  private  in-
cursions  into  their  legally  created  spheres.  The  beneficiaries  are  the
objects  of regulation  insofar  as  positive  law  authorizes  such  intrusions
and  affords  them  less protection  from private  conduct  than  they  would
like.63  Indeed,  the very  term  "statutory  beneficiary,"  as  conventionally
used,  assumes  that  the  common  law  is  the  ordinary  backdrop  or  the
usual state of affairs,  and  that departures  from  that state should  be  un-
derstood  as  providing  special  benefits  and  special  burdens.  It  is  not
surprising that assumptions  of this sort became impossible to  sustain in
the wake  of the New  Deal  attack  on  the common  law.

Notwithstanding  these  considerations,  the Data Processing decision
was justifiably  subject  to  powerful  criticism. 64  First,  an  effort  to  build
on  the legal-wrong  standard  probably  would have  been  superior  to  the
injury-in-fact  approach.  All of the foregoing ideas  could have  been ac-
commodated  within  the  legal-wrong  standard.  That  standard  accu-
rately  captures  the original  meaning  of the APA,  and it has  the further
advantage  of deriving  standing  doctrine  from  congressional  purposes
in  enacting  regulatory  legislation.65  The  legal-wrong  test also  has  the
significant virtue  of dissolving the distinction between  beneficiaries  and
regulated  entities by making it clear that statutes  provide the only work-
able  metric for deciding whether  there  is  a judicially  cognizable  injury.
Whether there is such an  injury cannot  be decided  in the abstract,  with-
out  regard  to  what  the  law  provides.  The  legal-wrong  test  does  not
build into  the inquiry a  distinct, extralegal  category  of beneficiaries.  In
this  respect,  it was  the  injury-in-fact  test  that  was  anachronistic,  pre-
cisely  because  it  suggested  that  there  was  a  prelegal  category  of inju-
ries-a point  that has  turned  out  to  have  considerable  importance. 66

self was  criticized  as a holdover from  private-law  ideas  from which Data
Processing had  to  some degree  escaped. 6 7  That requirement,  and  stand-
ing limitations  generally,  are  often  quite  sensible,68  but they  have  been
justified on the basis of policies  that actually have  little or nothing to do
with  standing  at  all.  Standing  limitations  are  said  to  ensure  that  law-
suits are concrete  rather than hypothetical or remote.69  But  the injury-
in-fact  requirement  and  other  limitations  on standing  do not  promote
concreteness;  indeed,  the  problem  of concreteness  has  nothing  to  do
with the question  of standing.  Whether  a plaintiff is able  to  point to an
injury peculiar  to  him is a  question independent  of the concreteness  or
abstraction  of the  dispute.  For  example,  the  dispute  in  Sierra Club  v.
Morton 7 0-the  principal  modem example of a case  denying standing on
injury-in-fact  grounds-was  hardly hypothetical  or remote.7 1  Standing
limitations  are  also  said  to  be  a  way  of ensuring  sincere  or  effective
advocacy. 7 2  But institutional litigants  not having  injury  in fact are  par-
ticularly likely to be strong advocates. 7"  It is  expensive  to initiate a law-
suit, and  those  who  do  so  without  meeting  the  standing requirements
are  especially  committed. 74

of the APA that promotes  autonomy and  self-determination  on the part of those  directly
affected.  See infra  note  157  and  accompanying  text.

An additional justification  for standing limitations  is that they are an  effective means
of limiting the  federal caseload.  But unless  there is  an independent  reason  for the limi-
tation  in  question,  it is  an  entirely  arbitrary way  of accomplishing  that goal;  and  in  any
case, there  is little evidence  that the elimination of standing requirements  would  materi-
ally  affect the  number  of suits  brought  in federal  court.  Indeed,  the  available  evidence
suggests  that  broadened  standing has  produced  very  little  in  the  way  of increased  law-
suits-perhaps an  unsurprising result in  light of the numerous costs,  monetary and  non-
monetary, of initiating litigation.  See K.  Davis,  Administrative  Law Treatise  222-27, 338

said  to  be  a  component  of judicial  restraint,  or  to  serve  the  system  of separation  of
powers.  This  claim raises  more complex  issues and is  discussed infra notes 182-204  and

STANDING

Notwithstanding  these  problems,  the  Data Processing approach  ap-
peared  for a long  time to  generate a body  of standing doctrine  that had
a  large  measure  of  coherence,  at  least  under  the  APA.7 5  As  the  law
developed,  courts  did not sharply  distinguish  between  statutory  benefi-
ciaries and  regulated  class members,  thus largely  eliminating  the  asym-
metry built into  previous  law.7 6  This  development  served  to remove  a
skewed  set of incentives  for administrators  who,  under the previous  re-
gime,  could  be  subject to a lawsuit  in  the  event of overzealous  enforce-
ment  action,  but  would  be  immunized  from  legal  controls  if  they
furnished insufficient  protection. 77  There is  powerful evidence  that the
recognition  of standing for regulatory beneficiaries  has  been  important
in bringing about  agency  compliance  with law. 78  At  the  same  time,  the
doctrine  has  excluded  merely  ideological  interests  and  the  interest  in
law  enforcement  for  its  own  sake. 79

A  principal  goal  of the Data Processing approach  was  to  achieve  a
large  degree  of clarity  and predictability.  And for  a period, the  injury-
in-fact  requirement  seemed  to  operate  in a  reasonably  straightforward
fashion.  It should  be clear, however,  that an assessment  of whether  the
plaintiff has  suffered  injury  in  fact  could  not be  the  only  question  for
purposes  of standing.  In  an  integrated  economy,  an  enormously  wide
variety  of people  are affected  by  an  agency's  decision  to  act  or  not to

75.  SeeJ.  Vining, supra  note  1, at  39-42.
76.  Some  asymmetry  remains,  however,  since  scarce  prosecutorial  resources  pro-
vide  a legitimate  reason  for agency  inaction.  The  fact  that agencies  must allocate  their
limited resources to  those problems  that seem  most pressing,  however,  has implications
for reviewability  rather  than  for standing.  See  Heckler  v.  Chaney,  470  U.S.  821,  831
(1985);  Sunstein,  Reviewing  Agency  Inaction  After  Heckler. v.  Chaney,  52  U.  Chi.  L.
Rev.  653,  683  (1985).

77.  Congress  has  recognized  this  risk and  expressly  granted  rights to  beneficiaries
in many  statutes.  See,  e.g.,  Surface  Mining  Control  and  Reclamation  Act  of  1977,  30
U.S.C.  §  1270  (1982);  Energy  Policy  and  Conservation  Act,  42  U.S.C.A.  § 6305  (West
1983  & Supp.  1988);  Clean Air Act, 42  U.S.C.  § 7604  (1982).

78.  See, e.g., Exec. Office of the President, Office of Management  and Budget,  Reg-
ulatory  Program  of the  U.S.  Gov't  213-14,  432-34,  469  & 492  (Apr.  1,  1986-Mar.  31,
1987)  (reflecting  agency  initiatives,  resulting from judicially  imposed  deadlines  in such
areas  as  environmental  and  labor  law);  see  also  United  Steelworkers  of  Am.  v.
Pendergrass,  819  F.2d  1263  (2d  Cir.  1987)  (requiring Secretary  of Labor  to  publish
standards  for providing  employees  with  information about  hazardous  chemicals,  result-
ing  in  29 C.F.R.  §§  1915.99,  1917.28,  1918.90  (1988));  Public Citizen Health  Research
Group v.  Tyson,  796 F.2d  1479  (D.C. Cir.  1986)  (finding that OSHA failed  to set proper

issue  temporary  standards  regarding  workplace  exposure  to formaldehyde,  resulting in
29  C.F.R.  § 1910.47  (1987)).

79.  The  characterization  of an  interest  as  "merely  ideological"  or  involving  "law
enforcement  for its  own  sake,"  must,  however,  be  based  on  the  relevant  statutes;  the
characterization  cannot  be  made  in  the  abstract.  By  conferring  a  legal  right,  a  statute
might  convert  an  ideological  interest  into  a legal  one.  See infra  notes  205-32  and  ac-

act.8 0  The  decision  of  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)
whether  a  particular  company  violated  an  environmental  statute,  and
should  face  civil  and  criminal  penalties,  will  have  consequences  "in
fact"  for workers  and  employers  in many other  companies  as  well-not
to  mention  consumers  generally.

In  these  circumstances, 

In Data Processing, the  Court  could  not have  meant  to  suggest  that
all affected  workers,  employers,  and consumers  could challenge  all EPA
decisions.  In order to produce  sensible results,  courts  had to build  into
the new framework  some distinction between  direct and  indirect conse-
quences  of agency decisions,  or between  legally cognizable  injuries  and
harms  that  Congress  could  not  have  intended  to  be  vindicated  in
court.8 1  In  this  sense,  the  injury-in-fact  test was  (and is)  quite  mallea-
ble,  and  the  standing  determination  inevitably  depends  on  a  range  of
considerations  that the notion of injury in fact,  by itself, cannot capture.
test,
though  appearing  unwieldy,  served  in practice  as  a lenient  and  worka-
ble  threshold  inquiry,  capturing  the  understanding  that  those  whose
interests  were entirely  afield  of statutory purposes  could  not bring  suit.
The test thus  operated  as  a check  against suits  brought by  people with
interests  unrelated  to  the  statutory  scheme.8 2  And  the  injury-in-fact
test itself, in its  early  period, appeared  to allow  suits  by regulatory ben-
eficiaries  and by  adversely  affected  competitors, but not to  allow stand-
ing  for  those  whose  interests  were  only  indirectly  and  incidentally

unduly  complicate  the  case  before  courts  reached  the  merits.

II.  THE  RETURN  OF  PRIVATE  LAW:  PRELEGAL  "INJURIES"
AND  CAUSATION

A.  The Doctrinal Trajectory: Injury, Nexus,  and Causation

After  Data Processing, the Supreme  Court  employed  several  princi-
ples  to  limit free  access  to judicial  review.8 8  None  of these  principles
was,  however,  of particular  importance  to administrative  law,  and most
of them  were  supported  by  at  least  plausible  reasons.8 9  Much  more

U.S.  29,  40-42  (1983);  the  recognition  of harms  that  amounted  to  mere  probability  of
injury, rather  than  sharply  focused  and  certain  to be  imposed  on particular  individuals,
as a  sufficient basis  for regulatory  intervention,  see  FCC  v.  National  Citizens  Comm. for
Broadcasting, 436 U.S.  775,  796-97  (1978);  the  relaxation of private law  conceptions  of
ripeness,  see  Abbott  Laboratories  v.  Gardner,  387  U.S.  136,  148-51  (1967);  and  the
limited  grant  of review  of enforcement  decisions,  see Dunlop  v.  Bachowski,  421  U.S.
560,  571-73  (1975).

86.  See  Sunstein,  supra  note  21,  at  423,  437-46.
87.  See  supra  note  85;  cases  cited  supra  note  78;  see  also  B.  Ackerman,  Recon-
structing  American  Law  (1984)  (arguing for  legal  controls  in  activist  state).  But  see
Stewart, The Discontents  of Legalism:  Interest Group  Relations  in Administrative  Reg-
ulation,  1985 Wis.  L. Rev. 655,  678-82  (arguing that in certain  contexts,  including envi-
ronmental,  health,  and  safety  regulation,  legal  controls  on  adminstration  have  led  to
pathologies  such  as  increased  transaction  costs  of negotiating  solutions).

The  development  and  enactment  in  1946  of the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  of
1946, Pub.  L. No.  79-404,  10 Stat.  237, was  a  critical step in  this process.  The expansion
of legal  controls  on administration  continued  from  1946.

88.  See,  e.g.,  Schlesinger  v.  Reservists  Comm.  to  Stop  the  War,  418  U.S.  208
(1974)  (denying citizen  and  taxpayer  standing);  United  States  v.  Richardson,  418  U.S.
166  (1974)  (denying  taxpayer  standing)

89.  Thus,  the  prohibition  on  citizen  or taxpayer standing  might be understood  as a
response to the  possibility that the political  process  would afford  sufficient protection:  if
all citizens  are affected,  there should be political  checks  on official  illegality.  It would  be
possible,  however,  to  respond  that  the political  checks  have  not  worked  in  the  circum-
stances;  that  the  constitutional  prohibition  is  not  otherwise  enforceable;  and  that  the
original decision  to constitutionalize  the prohibition reveals  that it was  intended  to oper-
ate  even  in  the  face  of political  acquiescence.  The  citizen  and  taxpayer  standing  cases
are  best understood  as rulings  that  the relevant  constitutional  provisions  do  not  create
self-executing  causes  of action  on  behalf  of plaintiffs.  See  infra  note  208  (discussing
implicit constitutional  grants  of cause  of action).

important  innovations  in  modern  standing  doctrine  can  be  found  in  a
series  of recent  decisions. 90  In  these  cases,  the  Supreme  Court  has
held that in order to  have standing, plaintiffs  must show  not only injury
in  fact,  but also  (a) that  there  is  a  substantial  likelihood  that plaintiffs'
injury  will be  remedied by a  decree  in their favor and  (b) that plaintiffs'
injury  is  a result of the action  of the governmental  defendant.  It is  not
altogether  clear  whether  these  requirements  are  an  interpretation  of
the APA  or  of article  III,  though  the Court  currently  classifies  them  as
constitutional in  status. 91

Understood in  the abstract  and properly  applied,  the requirements
are  natural and  entirely unobjectionable  corollaries  of the injury-in-fact
requirement  of Data Processing-not to  mention  the  article  III  ban  on
advisory  opinions.  If the plaintiffs  cannot  show  that  a  decree  in  their
favor will remedy their injury  or  that the defendant  was  responsible  for
that injury,  why  should  they  be  entitled  to  seek judicial  relief at  all?

At  the outset, however,  it is revealing  that the recent requirements
have  proved  important  principally  in  cases  in  which  statutory  benefi-
ciaries  are  challenging  as  legally  inadequate  the  government's  regula-
tion of third parties.  In such cases  standing has been  denied  because it
is  said  to be  uncertain  that  government  regulation  would  actually  help
any particular private  plaintiff.  And it is  in such  cases  that one  can  find
a  partial  return  to  a private-law  model  of public  law.

The  first  case  in  this  line  of  decisions  was  Linda  R.S.  v.  Richard
D.9 2-a  case  that appeared  quite  trivial at the time, but that has  come  to
assume  substantial  importance.  Linda R.S.  involved  an  action  brought
by  a  woman  against a  local  district  attorney  for failing  to  bring  suit  to
compel  the  father  of her  illegitimate  child  to  make  child  custody  pay-
ments. 93  The  plaintiff  alleged  that  the  state  statute  was  unconstitu-
tional  because  it  required  support  only  of legitimate  children.9 4  The
Court's  response  was  somewhat  odd.  In  the Court's  view,  the plaintiff
lacked  standing  because  she  could  not  show  that  a  criminal  action  by
the  prosecutor  would  benefit  her.  The  father  of the  child  might,  for
example, simply go  to jail.  "The  prospect that prosecution  will, at least
in  the future,  result in payment of support  can,  at best, be  termed  only
speculative."9 5

One problem  with  this  view is  that  the very  existence  of the  crimi-
nal  law  attests  to the seemingly  obvious  assumption-held  by the  legis-
lature  and  the  public  at  large-that  criminal  penalties 
influence

behavior. 9 6  If a  prosecutor  actually  seeks  criminal  sanctions  against
someone  who  fails  to  make  custody  payments,  there  is  good  reason  to
believe  that  he  will  comply.  The  increased  likelihood  of compliance
should  suffice  to  confer  standing.  The  point  is  supported  by  the  fact
that  if the  father  of a  child  in  the  case  brought  suit  to  challenge  the
constitutionality  of the  child-support  law  requiring  him  to  make  pay-
ments,  there would be no problem  of standing.9 7  For this  reason Linda
R.S. is probably  best understood  as a response  to  the courts'  traditional
reluctance  to compel action by criminal prosecutors. 98  It is not an ordi-
nary  standing  case  at all.  Even  if it is understood  in  these  terms,  how-
ever,  it  is  an  unfortunate  holdover  from  private-law  notions  of legal
injury;  and  it may  no longer  be  good  law.9 9

The  requirement  of causation was  more fully  elaborated  in  subse-
quent decisions.10 0  In  Simon  v.  Eastern Kentucky  Welfare Rights Organiza-
tion 10 t  (EKWRO),  the  Court  denied  standing  to  indigents  who  were

judge who secretly  believes that  the law does not influence behavior would find
no injury  in  fact.

gesting that  enforcement  policies  can  produce  injury  in  fact).

99.  The  plaintiff's  claim  was  one  of  inequality:  enforcement  proceedings  were
brought against fathers of legitimate  but not of illegitimate children.  Ajudicial  decision
redressing the inequality should suffice to provide  standing; it is the inequality  that is the
injury.  Here, moreover,  the question  was the  inequality in  the "protection"  afforded  to
mothers  of illegitimate  children,  who  were  in the  position  of plaintiffs,  and  not-as  the
Court would  have  it-fathers, who were  in the  position of defendants.  Indeed,  inequal-
ity in  "protection"  was  at  the  center  of the  fourteenth  amendment,  and  the  failure  to
treat  such  inequality  as  legally  cognizable  is  an  unfortunate  holdover from  Lochner-like
conceptions  of legal injury.  See Kennedy, McCleskey v.  Kemp:  Race,  Capital  Punishment,
and  the  Supreme  Court,  101  Harv.  L.  Rev.  1388,  1422-23  (1988).

The Court  recognized  considerations  of this  sort  in  Heckler v.  Mathews,  465  U.S.
728  (1984).  There  the  Court  said:  "[W]hen  the  'right  invoked  is  that  to  equal  treat-
ment,'  the  appropriate  remedy  is  a  mandate of equal  treatment,  a  result that  can  be ac-
complished  by withdrawal  of benefits  from  the  favored  class  as  well  as  by  extension  of
benefits  to  the  excluded  class." 
Id.  at  740  (quoting  Iowa-Des  Moines  Nat'l  Bank  v.
Bennett, 284  U.S.  239,  247  (1931)).  Linda R.S. cannot  be squared  with  Heckler, and  the
latter decision  states  the  appropriate  rule.

100.  See, e.g., Warth  v.  Seldin, 422  U.S. 490  (1975).  In  that case,  various  organiza-
tions  and  individuals  in Rochester,  New York,  brought suit against  Penfield,  New York,
claiming  that the Penfield zoning  ordinance  violated  the Constitution and  federal law by
excluding  poor people  and  members of minority  groups.  The Court  held that  the chal-
lenge  was  barred  on  standing grounds.  Id. at 517-18.  In  its view,  the  central  problem
with  the  claim  of those plaintiffs  allegedly  denied  the  opportunity  to purchase  or  lease
Penfield housing was  that they could  not show  a particular housing opportunity  that was
rendered  unavailable  to  them  as a result  of the  ordinance.  Id.  at 504.

challenging  an Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS) ruling  decreasing  incen-
tives  to  hospitals  to provide medical services  to the poor.  The plaintiffs
alleged  that  they  had  been  denied  medical  services  as  a  result  of this
ruling.' 0 2  The  Court,  however,  denied  standing because  the plaintiffs
could  not  show  that  the  ruling  affected  their  own  situation.10 3  "It  is
purely  speculative  whether  the  denials  of service  specified  in  the  com-
plaint  fairly  can  be  traced  to  petitioners'  'encouragement'  or  instead
result  from  decisions  made  by  the  hospitals  without regard  to  the  tax
implications."'10 4

The EKWRO  decision  might  be  treated  as  an  exceptionally  broad
ruling,  having  the  effect  of barring  many  suits  brought  by  regulatory
beneficiaries  on  the  ground  that  it  is  uncertain  whether  a  particular
benefit will  come to  them as  a result of government action  against third
parties.  The  decision  could be understood,  however,  as a  quite narrow
response  to  the well-established  idea  that one taxpayer  should not ordi-
narily  be  permitted  to  litigate  the  tax  liability  of  another.'0 5  In  this
sense,  the causation requirement,  as applied in EKWRO,  can operate  as
a  surrogate  for  a belief  that  Congress  implicitly  precluded  standing  of
this  kind in  most tax cases. 10 6

Perhaps  the most important  decision  in  this  line  of cases  is Allen v.
Wright,1' 7  in which  the parents  of children  attending  schools  undergo-
ing  desegregation  challenged,  on  statutory  and  constititutional
grounds,  the IRS'  failure  to  deny  tax deductions  to  segregated  private
schools.  The  plaintiffs  claimed  that  the  tax  deductions  increased  the

Court's  approach  as  "unnecessarily  stingy"  and  arguing  that  devision  "impose[s]  a
highly restrictive notion  of what it takes to satisfy  the injury requirement").  Here  too, it
is  important  and  revealing  that  the  hospitals  in question  would  undoubtedly  have  had
standing to  challenge an  IRS decision  increasing  hospitals'  obligations  to provide  medi-
cal  care  to the indigent.  See  L. Tribe,  supra  note  15,  § 3-18,  at  131.

104.  EKWRO,  426 U.S.  at 42-43.
105.  See id. at 46  (Stewart, J.,  concurring).  This  idea  is responsive  to  the  fear that
since  numerous  people are  affected by  tax  provisions  that influence  private  conduct,  an
injury-in-fact  test would  lead to widespread litigation,  uncertainty, and  unfortunate stare
decisis  effects.  The  idea  is  also  an  outgrowth  of  the  fact  that  Congress  has  expressly
provided  standing  for  some  taxpayers  and  not  others,  see  26  U.S.C.  §§  7421-7422,
7426,  7428-7429  (1982  & Supp.  IV  1986),  and  a  corresponding belief that  it is  unlikely
that  Congress  intended  to allow  all  third parties  affected  by  tax  incentives  to  bring suit
against  the  government.

106.  The  coherence  of this  rule  depends  on  the precise  right asserted.  A  claim  of
illegality  in a tax measure  allowing  every  white family  to  take  a $1000  deduction  would
surely provide  standing for black  plaintiffs.  Cf. Heckler  v.  Mathews,  465  U.S.  728,  738
(1986)  (husband  has  standing  to  challenge  "pension  offset"  that  adversely  affects

intended  to  permit  the  plaintiffs  to  bring  suit;  the  only  question  was

purchasers  of trucks,  challenged  a  regulatory  decision  to  reduce  mini-
mum fuel-economy  standards  for light trucks.  The plaintiffs  contended
that  the vehicles  available  for  purchase  would  have  reduced  fuel  effi-
ciency  as a result of this  decision.1 1 3  The  court of appeals  held  that the
requirements  for  standing  were  satisfied:  the  injury  consisted  of the
diminished  opportunity  to  purchase  the trucks  in  question,  that  injury
was  a product  of the  agency's  decision,  and  a  reversal  of that  decision
would  remedy  the injury.1 14  Judge  Scalia,  in  dissent,  complained  that

school  would  decide  to  transfer  the  child  to  public  school  as  a  result  of  any

members  desire~but  are  or  will  be  unable  to  purchase."' 1 5  Moreover,
"manufacturers  might well react to  the threat  of civil penalties  either by
merely paying  them  or by  altering  the marketing  of currently  available
products,  rather than  by installing  the unidentified  new  technology pe-
titioners'  members  allegedly  desire  to  purchase."" l 6

In  Center for  Auto  Safety  v.  Thomas," 7  organizations  representing
purchasers  of automobiles  challenged  an  EPA  rule  that  compensated
manufacturers  retroactively  for  changes  in  testing procedures  used  to
measure  the fuel economy  of each manufacturer's  sales fleet.  The EPA
concluded  that  the previous  testing procedures  were  inadequate.  The
retroactive  compensation  gave  General  Motors  and  Ford  credits  that
were worth  hundreds of millions  of dollars.  The resulting  credits could
be  used  to  offset  penalties  incurred in  previous  years  or  to  produce  a
cushion  against  future  deficiencies  in fuel-economy  standards.' 18

The  plaintiffs  alleged  that  as  a  result of this  decision,  automobile
manufacturers  would  fail  to  develop  and  use  technologies  that  would
improve  the fuel  efficiency  of their vehicles.  In the plaintiffs'  view, their
members  would  be less  likely  to  be able  to  purchase  fuel-efficient  cars.
Their injury consisted  of the diminished  availability and increased  price
of the relevant  cars.  No  individual  person  could  show,  however,  that
the EPA's  decision  would affect  a particular  purchasing  decision. 1 9  A
panel  of the court  of appeals  held  that  the  requirements  for  standing
were  satisfied,' 20  and  an  en  banc  court  affirmed  by an  equally  divided
vote. 12 1

Five judges  concluded  that  the original panel  decision was  correct.
The  injury  consisted  of the  increased  price  and  diminished  availability
of fuel-efficient  cars,  and  invalidation  of the  agency's  decision  would
redress  that injury. 12 2  Five  other judges contended  that "it is  not likely
that"  the  plaintiffs'  injury,  even  if it  occurred,  "will  be  caused  by  the
challenged  action, or be redressed  by a favorable  decision."' 2 3  Accord-

cient  injury.  Changes  in product design  qualified  as such  an injury; but
with  respect  to  those  changes,  the  causation  requirements  were  not
met. 124

In an  elaborate  separate  opinion, Judge  Silberman  contended  that
the injury  recognized by  the five judges  finding  standing  "stretches  be-
yond  recognition  the  limits  the Supreme  Court  has  articulated  for the
types  of harm  sufficient  to  confer Article  III  standing."' 25  In  his view,
the entire  concept  of consumer standing  must be rejected.  "So  long as
consumers  have  available  virtually  interchangeable  products,  a  reduc-
tion in supply-indeed  even  the actual  cessation-of one  brand cannot
constitute an  Article  III  injury."' 26  All  that is  at stake  here  is  "a  polit-
ical  or  ideological  interest  in  seeing  a  federal  law  enforced  against  a
third  party."' 2 7  Consumer  standing  should  be  treated  like  taxpayer
standing;  in  both cases,  article  III  requires  that  "redress  is  to  be  found
under our constitutional system  at the polls-not in Federal  courts." 1 28
Adoption  of ideas  of the sort  expressed  by the five judges  arguing
against standing  in Thomas would have  enormous  consequences  for the
law,  the same  is even  more emphatically  true of the views  expressed  by
Judge  Silberman and Judge  Scalia.  Indeed, such views  would  move the
doctrine  sharply  in  the direction  of the  private-law  model  as  it existed
well before  the original cases  that extended  the category  of legally  cog-
nizable  interests  to  include  statutory  beneficiaries.' 29  In  those  cases
too, the injury, narrowly defined,  would not necessarily  be  alleviated by
action from the governmental  defendant.' 30  By restricting  the require-
ment of an injury to  a nineteenth  century  private right, a strong version
of the causation  requirements  would  replicate  ideas  last  seen  in  public
law more than  two  decades  ago, when  the legal  culture had  only begun

likely  alternative is  that a company  faced  with substantial penalties  will  first re-

to  accommodate  the understandings  that  gave  rise  to  regulatory  sys-
tems in  the first  instance.

As  the disputes  in  the Center for Auto Safety  cases  suggest,  the reach
of the  recent  decisions  is  a  matter  of  current  controversy.  In  some
cases,  the causation  requirements  are easily met when  a plaintiff is ask-
ing  the  government  to  seek  sanctions  against  a  violator.13 1  In  other
cases,  however,  the  causation  requirements  are  much more  difficult  to
apply.  Any  particular  beneficiary  of a  regulatory  program  will  often
have  a  hard  time  showing  that  any  particular  regulatory  intervention
will help  in  a particular  way.  The  reason is  that  the injury  is  not of the
discrete and  individual sort typical at common law.  Instead, it is regula-
tory  in  nature,' 3 2  and  best  characterized  as  systemic,  collective,  or
probabilistic.  Regulatory  regimes  are  typically designed  to  reduce  risks
of injury  that affect large  numbers  of people.  The connection  between
the  risk  and  any  actual  injury  to  any  person  cannot  readily  be  estab-
lished  either before  or after the fact.  The  consequences  of greater  en-
forcement  for  any  particular  member  of the  class  of beneficiaries  are
often  unavoidably  speculative,  even  though  the  systemic  impact-for
classes  of citizens  suffering  from  inadequate  administrative  protection
against  product  risks,  discrimination,  fraud,  or  other  harms-is  sub-
stantial.  The  basic  point  applies  to  many  statutes,  ranging  from  those
covering  environmental,  automotive, and  occupational  hazards  to those
designed  to  reduce  discrimination.

Moreover,  there  is  no  clear  basis  for  deciding  whether  or  not  re-
dress  of injuries  in such  cases  is  speculative.  The  manipulable  charac-
ter  of the inquiry  has  resulted  in  considerable  doctrinal  confusion. 13 3
And  as  the disagreements  in  the  Center for Auto  Safety  cases  make  clear,
the causation  inquiry will  turn in large  part  not on  causation  itself, but
on how  the relevant injury is characterized  and on what sorts of injuries
qualify  as legally  cognizable.13 4  The Supreme Court  has given  conflict-
ing  signals' on  this  point  as  well.' 35  In  these  ways,  the  causation  re-
quirements  have reintroduced  precisely  the sort of unpredictability  that

the Data Processing test was  intended  to  eliminate.1 3 6

B.  Separation of Powers

EKWRO  and Allen  might  be  understood as  narrow  decisions  about
the  standing  of one  taxpayer  to  litigate  the  tax liability  of another.  In
such  cases,  it  is  plausible  to  infer  that  Congress  foreclosed  a  general
right  to  bring  suit.1 3 7  As  pure  standing  cases,  however,  some  of the
causation decisions  are not easy  to  defend.  In  particular, EKWRO  and
especiallyAllen  seem wrongly  decided.1 38  There can be little doubt that
the  decisions  are  informed  by  norms  of  separation  of powers,  quite
apart from ideas  about causation.  In the absence of other doctrinal  av-
enues  for  restricting  standing,  the  causation  requirements  are  being
used  to  do work  that  has  little  to  do with  causation. 139

The  separation  of powers  norms  were  made  explicit  in  Allen  v.
Wright,140  in  which  the Court  said  that the  "idea  of separation  of pow-
ers  that  underlies  standing  doctrine  explains"  the  conclusion  in  the
case. 14 '  The  Court wrote  that  a  decision  to  allow  standing  in All",n
would pave  the way  generally  for suits challenging,  not specifi-
cally identifiable Government  violations  of law,  but the partic-
ular  programs  agencies  establish  to  carry  out  their  legal
obligations.  Such suits, even  when premised  on allegations  of
several  instances  of violations  of law,  are  rarely  if ever appro-
priate  for  federal-court  adjudication.  "Carried  to  its  logical
end,  [respondents']  approach  would  have  the federal  courts  as
virtually  continuing  monitors of the wisdom and  soundness  of
Executive  action.1 42

In  this  view,  the  causation  requirements  are  a  means  of  ensuring
against  certain  sorts  of actions  against  governmental  defendants,  ac-
tions  that raise  serious  questions  of judicial  role.

Ideas of this sort help account for the denial of standing in EKWRO
and Linda R.S.,  which  also involved  suits attempting  to  compel govern-
mental  officials  to  bring  actions  against  private  parties.  The  Supreme
Court has  shown  hostility  to  such  suits in  other  contexts  as  well,  quite
outside the law  of standing. 14 3  On this view,  actions brought by regula-

139.  A variety of other ideas  may also  be  at work  in these cases.  Indeed,  the causa-
tion  requirements  appear  to be attempts  to perform  some  of the  role of the  legal-inter-
est  test by  responding  to  a perception  that  Congress  implicitly  barred  the  action.

tory  beneficiaries  to  require  greater  regulatory  protection  attempt  to
vindicate  injuries  that  ought  to  be  cognizable  politically  but  not
through  the judiciary.  There  is  in  this  respect  a  clear  connection  be-
tween  the  causation  requirements  and  certain  conceptions  of judicial
restraint and  separation  of powers.  The  recent  cases  might  be  under-
stood as  an effort  to  narrow the judicial  role in actions  brought by  stat-
utory  beneficiaries-often  having  numerous  members-to  compel
government  action against private  parties.  The  causation  requirements
are  one  of several  devices  by which  to  accomplish  this  goal. 144

The underlying  concern, captured  in Allen v.  Wright, 14 5  is  that while
courts  should  protect  the  objects  of regulation,  they  should  be  reluc-
tant  to  compel  the executive  branch  to  undertake  enforcement  action
to vindicate  the general  or societal  interests of regulatory  beneficiaries.
In  this view,  suits brought  to  challenge  "the particular  programs  agen-
cies establish  to carry  out their legal obligations"1 4 6  should not bejudi-
cially  cognizable.  The  distinctive  judicial  role  is  the  protection  of
traditional  or  individual  rights  against  governmental  overreaching. 147
This  claim  purports  to  derive  strength  from  the  constitutional  provi-
sion,  invoked  in  this  way  in Allen  and  another  recent  decision  of the
Court, 148  that  confers  on  the  President, not  the judiciary,  the  authority
to  "take  Care  that  the laws  be  faithfully  executed."' 49

The  recent  standing  requirements  belong  in  the  same  category  as
other  recent  decisions  restricting  judicial  intrusions  into  administra-
tion,  with respect  to  both substance' 5 0  and  procedure.i 5 1  They  reflect

court  entanglement  in  executive  functions.  The  congruence  of these
kinds  of skepticism  has  been  critical  in  the  cases.  The  two  have  been
combined  in  no  other  recent  period. 152

There  is  a  commonality  between  the New  Deal  approach  and  still
tentative  developments  in  current  law,  and  it lies  in  the  belief that  ad-
ministrative  regulation,  grounded  as  it is  in  technocratic  expertise  and
political  accountability, is incompatible  with judicial oversight.  The dif-
ference  is that the New  Deal view was  rooted in hospitality  toward regu-
latory intervention  and  fear of politically motivated  invalidation,  by the
courts,  of desirable  administrative  programs,  whereas  the  modern  de-
velopments  are  based  on hostility  to  intervention  and  fear  of judicially
compelled  regulation.  But  in  either  case,  the  doctrine  of  standing
serves  to minimize  the occasions  for legal  intervention  into  the regula-
tory process,  and  thus  to  limit  the  strain between  what are  regarded  as,
two  distinct  mechanisms  for  social  ordering.  Understood  against  this
background,  the  causation  requirements  are  a  means  of  ensuring
against  the  perceived  excesses  of Data Processing in  allowing judicial  re-
dress  of what might  be seen  as  essentially political  grievances.' 53  That
rationalization,  however,  is  ultimately  unpersuasive.

III.  PUBLIC  LAW  AND  STANDING

A.  The Appropriate Role of Standing Limitations

As a  general rule, the  question for purposes  of standing  is whether
Congress  has  created  a  cause  of action.' 5 4  A  congressional  resolution
of the  standing  issue  is  almost always  authoritative.  It is  in  this  sense,

152.  Thus,  in the  1930s,  skepticism  about the judiciary  generally  accompanied  en-
thusiasm about  regulation;  among  conservatives,  a minority  in  that  period, skepticism
about  regulation  led  to  enthusiasm  for  the judiciary;  and  in  the  1960s,  liberal  judges
combined  hospitality toward  regulation  with enthusiasm  for an  aggressive judicial  role.
See  Sunstein,  supra  note 21,  at 437-41.  The  general  phenomenon  is  remarked  on  in
Note,  Intent,  Clear Statement,  and  the  Common  Law:  Statutory  Interpretation  in  the
Supreme  Court, 95  Harv.  L. Rev.  892,  910-12  (1982).  See generally  Sunstein,  Statutes
and  the Regulatory  State  (Sept.  1988)  (unpublished manuscript  on file at the Columbia
Law Review).

153.  One of the problems  with  the recent  trend is that it treats  a dispute as  "polit-
ical,"  not because  of the  absence  of legal  constraints,  but  because  the injury is  different
from what  is typical  at common  law.  Whether  a  grievance  is  political depends  on  the
underlying  statute;  the  question  cannot  be answered  in  the  abstract.  See  infra  notes
229-30  and  accompanying  text.  Moreover,  the  political question  doctrine-not  stand-
ing-is the  appropriate  tool for ensuring  that courts  do not  hear  cases  involving  issues
not suited  to the judiciary.  See  Henkin,  Is  There  a "Political  Question"  Doctrine?,  85
Yale  LJ.  597  (1976)  (suggesting  political  question  applies  where  there  are  no  legally
cognizable  standards).  Properly understood,  the principles  of standing deal with appro-
priate plaintiffs,  not with issues  beyond judicial competence-though  the two ideas  have
not been  kept entirely separate in practice.  See, e.g., Allen v. Wright,  468 U.S.  737,  751
(1984)  (suggesting that issues  of standing must be considered in context  of separation  of
powers).

154.  There are some  exceptions  here.  See infra notes 205-32  (discussing article III

HeinOnline  -- 88 Colum. L. Rev. 1461 1988

COLUMBIA  LA W REVIEW

[Vol.  88:1432

and  only  this  sense,  that  standing  limitations  are  part  of the  "case  or
controversy"  requirement of article III;  and it is in this  sense that stand-
ing  doctrine  serves  an  important  separation-of-powers  function.

In  many  standing  cases,  however,  the  question  whether  Congress
has  created  a cause  of action  cannot  be  answered  simply.  The  legisla-
ture  cannot  be  expected  to  resolve  that question  in  every  setting.  The
APA is of course  controlling in most administrative law cases,  and inter-
pretation  of the standing requirements  of the APA is  therefore the cen-
tral question.  Probably  the best approach  here would have been  to  use
the  legal-wrong  test  as  it  had  been  developing  before  Data Processing,
focusing  attention  on  whether  the plaintiff's  interest  was  protected  by
the underlying  substantive  statute. 155  The law  has  taken  a quite  differ-
ent  direction, however,  and  it is  possible  to understand  the current  in-
jury-in-fact  test as an interpretation  of the APA that does  relatively little
violence  to  the underlying  purpose  of that  statute.  The  principal  func-
tion  of the requirement  of injury in  fact-insofar as  it provides  a limita-
tion  on  standing-is  to  decrease  the  likelihood  that  outsiders  or
intermeddlers t 56  will  be  able  to  disrupt  mutually  beneficial  arrange-
ments.  In  this  respect, the requirement  of injury  in fact-rooted in  the
APA,  not  article  III-promotes  autonomy  and  self-determination  on
the  part  of litigants. 15 7

and  standing).  In  some  cases,  moreover,  the  issue  is  whether  the  Constitution  itself
creates  a  right  to bring  suit.  See infra  note 208.

155.  See  supra  notes 39-51  and  accompanying  text.
156.  Here  as  elsewhere  it  is  necessary  to develop  a  standpoint  from  which  to  de-
scribe  some  people  as "intermeddlers"  and  others  as  "injured";  there is  no  extra-legal
way  to make  that determination,  or  to do  so without invoking  controversial  substantive
considerations.

157.  Stewart,  supra  note  I,  at  1735-47.  In  Sierra  Club  v.  Morton,  405  U.S.  727
(1972),  the  Court refused  to recognize  standing in an action  brought by an environmen-
tal  organization  whose  members  had  not  claimed  use  of  a  recreational  preserve
threatened  with  an  allegedly  unlawful  development  project.  Id.  at  735.  The  Court's
conclusion  was correct,  for if none of those affected  by the  creation  of a  development  in
the preserve  was willing  to come  forward,  a group  of outsiders  probably  should not  be
permitted  to do so-at least as a matter  of interpretation of the APA and  other relevant
statutes.  Cf. Brilmayer, The Jurisprudence  of Article  III:  Perspectives  on  the "Case  or
Controversy"  Requirement,  93  Harv. L.  Rev. 297,  310-15  (1979)  (discussing autonomy
and self-determination  as animating  concerns  of article  III).  A different  result might  be
appropriate  if it could be shown  that  those directly affected  were  unwilling to bring suit
for  reasons  other  than  contentment  with  the  status  quo.  See  L.  Tribe,  supra  note  15,
§ 3-19.

At  least ordinarily,  the fact  that the  law  prohibits  certain  activity  is  not  a  sufficient
reason  to  permit a  suit by  outsiders.  Agencies  quite  properly use  prosecutorial  discre-
tion  to  allocate  resources  among  various  problems;  some  of those problems  may  have
comparatively  weak  claims  to the  public fisc.  If no  one  directly  affected  by  government
action  is  sufficiently concerned  to bring  suit, the  usual assumption-subject  to congres-
sional  override-ought  to be that  third parties should  not be permitted  to do  so.  Note,
however,  that concepts  like  "bystander"  and  "outsider"  are artifacts of preexisting  ideas

STANDING

1463

The  causation  requirements  present  different  issues.  Standing  by
themselves,  they  are  natural  corollaries  of  the  injury-in-fact  require-
ment and unobjectionable  as such.  But aside from their manipulability,
the  central  problem  is  that  in  the  suits  in  question  here,  the  relevant
harms are quite generally  probabilistic  or systemic.  The purpose  of the
regulatory  program  is  to  redress  harms  of precisely  that  sort.' 5 8  It
would  be  a large  mistake to  conclude that  such harms  are  not judicially
cognizable.  Nineteenth  century  conceptions  of injury  should  not  be
used  to  resolve  standing  issues  in  administrative  law.  Those  concep-
tions  have  no  place  in  regimes  in  which  the  legal  injury  is  often  of a
different  order.  A system in which regulatory  harms  were not judicially
cognizable would  tend to  allow regulated  industries,  but not regulatory
beneficiaries,  to  have  access  to  court-thus  imposing  a  perverse  set of
incentives  on administrative  actors  by inclining  them against regulatory
implementation  when it is legally required. 5 9  Such a result would tend
to defeat  congressional  purposes. 160  Nothing in article  III, the APA,  or
the governing  statutes justifies  this  result.

In cases  brought  under  the APA,  then,  courts  should  generally  al-
low  standing  to plaintiffs  who  seek  to  redress  systemic  or probabilistic
harms.  On this  view,  there will remain  a role for the causation  require-
ments,161  but the  role  will  be  the  limited  one  suggested  by  the  best  of
the Supreme  Court's  decisions  on  the  point.' 62

B.  Cognizable Injuries and the Appropriate Role  of Causation

It should  come  as  no  surprise  that  the causation  requirements  are
highly manipulable.  Judgments  about whether or not causation is  spec-
ulative depend on no  clear  metric.  It is  difficult to  make  systematic the
inquiry into whether  government action against  a third  party is  likely  to
affect  behavior  in  ways  that  will  help  a  particular  class  of plaintiffs.
Thus,  the  Court  has  found  that  the  causation  requirements  were  met
when  the connection  between  the injury,  the defendant's  conduct,  and

could therefore  reject  the outcome  in Sierra Club by  granting  standing if it so chose;  and
the  best  argument  against  the  result  in Sierra Club would  be  that  the  relevant  statutes
should have  been  interpreted  to  create  a  cause  of action  for  the plaintiffs.

158.  For  the  same  argument  in  the  context  of constitutional  claims,  see  Meltzer,
supra  note 4,  at 304  ("The  common  law understanding  of injury, however,  is  not  well
suited  to  deal  with  the  distinctive  problems  of modern  governments,  which  can  cause
serious  harm  of a systemic  or  probabilistic  kind  that does  not  fit  into  the  common-law
mold of identifiable  injury  to identifiable  individuals.").

159.  See  supra  note  78  (listing regulatory  initiatives  brought  about  as  a result  of

suits  by beneficiaries).

160.  For  most  of the  nation's  history,  the  question  for purposes  of standing  and
article III was whether  there was an  invasion  of a legal right.  That question is analogous
to the  inquiry  recommended  here.  See  Winter,  supra  note 8,  at  1395-96.

the relief sought were  no clearer  than  in Linda R.S.,  EKWRO,  and Allen
v.  Wright.' 63  After  these  decisions,  the precise  nature  of the causation
requirements  is  quite  obscure. 164

In  particular,  the  causation  requirements,  as  sometimes  applied,
threaten  to  make  standing  issues  turn  on  considerable  discovery,
factfinding,  and, worst of all, judicial  speculation  on  the  precise  effects
of regulatory  initiatives.  All  this  is  a  significant  disadvantage  over the
pre-Data Processing approach, which depended  on legal issues that could
be  resolved  on  the basis  of the  pleadings  without  complex  factual  in-
quiries.  The  new  law  of standing  has  in  this  respect  come  to  be  less
crisp  and  certain  than  the  previous  regime-precisely  the  opposite  of
what  the Data Processing Court  intended.

A  large  amount  of doctrinal  confusion  is  the  consequence.  The
opinions  of the en  banc court of appeals  in  the Thomas case provide  the
most conspicuous  example.  In that case,  standing was  made  to turn  on
an  extraordinarily  complicated  inquiry  into  the  real-world  impact  of
fuel economy  credits  on automobile  manufacturers.16 5  There  is  some-
thing  seriously wrong  with  standing  principles  that produce  so  high  a
degree  of confusion  in what  is,  after all,  a jurisdictional  determination.
Moreover,  the relevant  decisions  have  not  turned  on  causation  alone,
notwithstanding  their  rhetoric.  The  inquiry  into  causation  is  in  part  a
disguise  for  other  sorts  of considerations-prominently  including  the
view that  Congress  could  not have intended  to grant standing  to plain-
tiffs  whose  access  to  court would  interfere  with  executive  prerogatives
about implementation.' 6 6

The manipulable  nature  of the inquiry  into  causation  appears  in a
less obvious  and more important  place as well.  The central  problem  in
the causation cases  is not whether  there is a causal nexus  among injury,
remedy,  and  illegality;  it  is  how  to  characterize  the  relevant  injury.
Whether  the  injury  is  due  to  the  defendant's  conduct,  or  likely  to  be

163.  See  Duke  Power Co.  v.  North Carolina  Envtl.  Study Group,  Inc.,  438  U.S.  59
(1978).  In Duke Power the plaintiffs  complained  that the Price-Anderson  Act  encouraged
the building of a  nuclear  power plant in  their vicinity.  Id. at 69.  The  Court  concluded
that  the  various  environmental  and  aesthetic  consequences  of thermal  pollution  were
sufficient to qualify as injuries  "in  fact."  Id. at 73-74.  But the claim  of a causal connec-
tion  was quite speculative;  it was  hardly  certain that  such  effects  would  occur, and  their
consequences  for  any  particular  plaintiff were  highly  uncertain.  Other  cases  allowing
standing  despite  relatively  attenuated  chains  of causation  include  Heckler  v.  Mathews,
465 U.S.  728,  737-38  (1984);  Larson  v. Valente, 456 U.S.  228, 239-42  (1982);  Bryant  v.

STANDING

remedied  by  a  decree  in  his  favor,  depends  on  how  the  injury  is  de-
scribed.  In EKWRO,  for  example,  the  plaintiffs  might  have  character-
ized  their injury  as an impairment  of the opportunity to  obtain  medical
services  under a regime undistorted  by unlawful  tax incentives.  In Allen
v.  Wright,  the  plaintiffs  themselves  argued  that  their  injury  should  be
characterized  as  the deprivation of an opportunity  to undergo  desegre-
gation  in  school  systems  unaffected  by  unlawful  tax  deductions. 167
Thus  recharacterized,  the  injuries  are  not  speculative  at  all. 168  If  de-
scribed  at a  certain  level  of generality,  the causation  requirements  are
comfortably  met in both cases.  It is for this  reason that in Centerfor Auto
Safety  v.  Thomas,  much  of the dispute-under  the rubric  of causation-
actually  turned  on  whether  the  injury  to  the  opportunity  to  purchase
fuel-efficient  cars  was  a  legally  cognizable  one.

The  device  of recharacterization  of the  injury  may  seem  artificial,
but it is at work in at least  one Supreme Court decision.  In Regents of the
University  of California v.  Bakke,169  a  question  was  raised  about  Allen
Bakke's  standing.  There  was  no  showing  that Bakke  would  have  been
admitted  to  the  medical  program  of  the  University  of  California  at
Davis  if the affirmative  action  program were  invalidated.  The Court  re-
sponded  that  "even  if Bakke  had  been  unable  to  prove  that  he  would
have  been admitted in  the absence  of the special  program,  it would not
follow that he lacked standing....  The trial court found such an injury,
apart  from  failure  to  be  admitted,  in  the  University's  decision  not  to
permit Bakke  to compete  for all  100  places  in the class,  simply  because
of his  race."1 7 0  The  Court  thus  concluded  that  the interference  with
the opportunity  to  compete  was  the relevant injury,  and  that the causa-
tion  requirements  were  met with  respect  to  that injury.1 71  For  regula-
tory  harms  as  well,  the central  question is  whether  an increased  risk  or
diminished  opportunity  is  legally  cognizable,  or  whether  particular
plaintiffs  must  instead  show  that  there  is  a  substantial  likelihood  that
particular  harm  will  come  to  them  as  individuals.

The  causation  issues  could,  in  short,  turn  entirely  on  whether
plaintiffs are  permitted  to  characterize  the relevant harm broadly  rather
than  narrowly.  A relatively broad  characterization  has  been  critical  not
only in Bakke,  but in a  number of lower  court  decisions  as  well.1 7 2  But

COLUMBIA  LAW  REVIEW

[Vol.  88:1432

the  Supreme  Court  has  given  little  or  no  guidance  for  resolving  the
problem  of characterization.

On  one  view,  the problem  should  be  solved  by  looking  at  the na-
ture  of the interest protected  by the relevant statutory or  constitutional
provision.  The  harm  might  be  characterized  broadly  if the  relevant
source  of law  is  designed  to  prohibit  the  injury  thus  characterized.  A
related  route  would  be  to  ask  straightforwardly  whether  Congress  in-
tended  to confer  on the plaintiff a right to bring  suit.  There  are signifi-
cant  advantages to  such an approach, and to  some degree  it is endorsed
in  current  law. 17 3

But the Data Processing Court  interpreted the APA  to  confer a  cause
of action  on  those  harmed  by agency  behavior,  thus  separating  the is-
sues  of standing and  the merits; 1 74  and  this interpretation was  intended
precisely  to  allow  a brisk  threshold  determination,  one  that  would  not
call  for  elaborate  statutory  construction.  On  the  other  hand,  it is  im-
possible  in  the hardest  cases  to  decide  standing  issues  without  asking
whether  the  governing  substantive  statute  is  designed  to  protect  the
plaintiffs;  in  those  cases,  some such  inquiry  is  necessary  because  by  it-
self, the injury-in-fact  test is  too  open-ended  and  malleable  in  an inte-
grated  economy.  Insofar  as  they  act  as  crude  surrogates  for  this
inquiry,  the causation  requirements  confirm  this  proposition.

A large part  of the solution  lies  in  a  recognition  that  the problem
of standing  is  generally  for  legislative  resolution,  and  that  if Congress
chooses  to  create  regulatory  systems  to  prevent  probabilistic  or  sys-
temic  injuries, the usual rule ought  to be  that courts  should permit liti-
gants  suffering such  injuries  to bring  suit.  Nothing in article  III or  the
APA justifies  a  sharp  split  between  injuries  of the nineteenth-century
variety  and  injuries  that  regulatory  systems  are  designed  to  prevent.
The question whether there is a  "case  or controversy"  within the mean-
ing of article III  depends  largely or entirely  on positive  law,  not on the
nature  of the injury. 175  Moreover,  a prohibition  on standing in  regula-

tory cases  would  represent a  partial return  to  the private-law  model  of
the  1950s  and  1960s,  allowing  regulated  entities,  but  not  regulatory
beneficiaries,  to bring  suit.  Such a result would  skew  regulatory incen-
tives  against implementation,  thus  tending  to defeat congressional  pur-
poses  and  expectations.

It follows  that  the Center for Auto  Safety  cases  were  quite easy.  Con-
gress  expressly  conferred  standing  on  the plaintiffs  to  redress  regula-
tory  harms-"any  person  who  may  be  adversely  affected"-and  there
was  no  need  for  elaborate  speculation  about  the precise  effects  of ad-
ministrative  controls.  Even  if the  cases  had  not involved  a  specialized
standing  provision  and  had  arisen  under  the  APA,  the  same  result
would  be appropriate.  The regulatory  harm provided  the necessary  in-
jury  in  fact,  and  with  respect  to  that harm,  there  was  no  problem  with
causation.  It also  follows  that EKWRO  and Allen  were  wrongly  decided
as  general  standing  cases,  although  EKWRO  may  have  been  correctly
decided  because  the  area  of  taxation  presents  special  reasons  for
caution. 176

To  say  this  is  hardly  to  suggest  that  courts  should  abandon  the
causation  requirements  and  the instincts  that  underlie  them.  Standing
should  be  denied  in  three  categories  of cases  brought under  the APA.
The  first includes  cases  in which  even broadly  characterized  injuries  do
not  meet  the causation  requirements.  Suppose,  for  example,  that  the
plaintiffs  are  able  to  characterize  their  injuries  in  probabilistic  or  sys-
temic terms,  but those injuries  are not likely  to be redressed  by a ruling
against  the defendant. 17 7  A denial of standing in such cases  is a natural
implication  of the  injury-in-fact  requirement  that  the  Court  has  found
in  the  APA.  If the  harm,  however  characterized,  is  not likely  to  be  re-
dressed  by a  ruling  for  the plaintiffs,  it is  appropriate  to  conclude  that
there  is  no  injury  in  fact.  Judicial  relief should  be  unavailable  on  the
same  theory as  in Sierra Club v.  Morton,17 8  in which  the plaintiffs  did not
allege  that they were actual  or prospective  users  of the park in question.
The  second  category  includes  cases  in  which  the  injury,  once

176.  See supra  notes  105-06  and  accompanying  text.
177.  United States  v. SCRAP, 412  U.S.  669  (1973),  is an  illustration  here.  Even as
recharacterized,  the  connection  between  the  relief sought  and  the  plaintiffs'  injury  was
extremely  loose.  For  other  possible  examples,  see  Community  for  Creative  Non-
Violence  v.  Pierce, 814  F.2d  663,  666-70  (D.C.  Cir.  1987)  (denying standing  to  home-
less  people  seeking  to challenge  a  report  on  the  homeless);  American  Legal  Found.  v.

although having no members  but only supporters, attempted  to challenge  FCC failure  to
investigate  network  broadcasting concerning  the  CIA);  California Ass'n of the  Physically

recharacterized,  is so generalized  or diffuse  that all or almost all citizens
are  affected  in  the  same  way. 179  Recharacterized  injuries  may  become
so  open-ended  that  they  are  no  longer  properly  treated  as  injuries  at
all;  here the proper  analogy  is  to  taxpayer  or citizen  standing.  In  such
circumstances  as  well,  the case  is  quite  similar  to  Sierra Club v.  Morton,
and  in the absence  of a clear statement  from Congress,  standing should
be  unavailable.  The  APA  is  properly  interpreted  to  forbid standing  in
such  cases,  even  if the  principle  is  understood  as  subject  to  legislative
override.  This  category  is  relatively  small,  however,  as  Bakke,  Duke
Power, and  the Center for Auto  Safety  cases  reveal.  It is  critical not  to  use
the prohibition  on  citizen  or  taxpayer  standing  to  support  a  broader,
and  indefensible,  view  that  disallows  standing when  a large  number of
people  are  affected.

Finally,  and  most importantly, standing  should  be  denied  to  those
seeking  to  redress  regulatory  harms  when  there  is  good  reason  to  be-
lieve  that  Congress  intended  not  to  allow  the suit  to  go  forward.  The
presumption here should be in favor of standing,  since in Data Processing
the Court  interpreted the APA as  creating a  general background  rule in
favor  of  standing  for  those  harmed  and  arguably  within  the  zone  of
protected  interests.18 0  Sometimes,  however,  that  rule will  be  rebutted
by  the  statutory  language  or structure  in particular  cases,  as  the Court
found  in Block  v.  Community Nutrition Institute.'8'  By  itself, the injury-in-

179.  The  Court's  decision  in SCRAP may be incorrect  because  the case  falls  in  this
category.  SCRAP, 412  U.S.  at 686-88.  In  Diamond  v. Charles,  476 U.S.  54  (1986),  the
Court  properly  denied  standing  to  a  doctor  who  attempted  to  defend  a  state  statute
limiting  abortion.  The  doctor  claimed,  in  relevant  part,  that  his  injury  consisted  in  a
smaller number  of children available for his medical  practice.  Id, at 66.  But if injuries  of
this  sort  sufficed,  all  or  almost  all  citizens  could  defend  restrictive  abortiQn  statutes,
Notably,  however,  the Diamond Court recognized  that  the Illinois  legislature  might grant
standing  even  in  such  cases.  Id.  at 65  n.17;  see  also  Clarke v.  Securities  Indus.  Ass'n,
107  S.  Ct. 750,  754 n.7  (1987)  (recognizing  that Congress  may  either grant  or withhold
standing);  EKWRO,  426  U.S.  26,  41  n.22  (1976)  (legislature  may  grant  standing,  but
"'plaintiff  still must allege a  distinct and palpable  injury  to himself, even  if it is an  injury
shared  by  a  large class  of other  possible  litigants'  ")  (citations omitted).

of consumer  standing  to  the  case  of a  harm  applying  to  all  citizens  and  all  taxpayers.

Centerfor Auto  Safety v.  Thomas consisted  of a  subclass  of the  citizenry  made  up of people
who  sought  to  purchase  fuel-efficient  cars;  that  subclass  is  sufficiently  well-defined  for
purposes  of standing.  Indeed,  it  is no  different  in  principle  from  a  class  of employers
seeking  to  avoid regulatory  controls.

economy.  Millions  of people  are affected  "in  fact"  by many  agency  de-
cisions.  In  these  circumstances,  the application  of the  test in the hard-
est cases  will  inevitably  depend on  a judicial perception  of whether  the
injury is  direct  or incidental,  and  that perception  should  be based  on a
reading  of congressional  purposes.  The  causation  requirements  have
been  made  to  do  much  of the  work  of restrictions  on  standing  when
such restrictions  are  a plausible  understanding  of legislative will.  That
issue  should  be  approached  more  directly.  If EKWRO  was  rightly  de-
cided,  it was  because  the tax  statutes  should  have  been  interpreted  so
as  to  deny  standing,  not  because  of a  problem  with  causation;  and  if
people  now  thought  to be  indirectly  or incidentally  harmed  by  regula-
tory  action  or  inaction  are  to be  denied  standing,  it is  because  the  de-
nial  is  a  sensible  reading  of  congressional  purposes  in  enacting
regulatory  legislation.

The  usual solution, then,  is  that the intended  beneficiaries  of regu-
latory programs  should be permitted to  bring suit to vindicate  statutory
requirements.  In  some circumstances,  suits  will  be  brought by  people
not within  the  zone  of protected  interests,  or-as  in Block  and  the tax
context of EKWRO-there will be  some other indication  that Congress
did not intend  the suit  to  go forward.  Most  actions  brought by  benefi-
ciaries  to  redress  regulatory  harms  will  not, however,  fall  within  these
categories,  and  the  general  rule  of Data Processing will  control.

C.  Separation of Powers Revisited

The  recent  standing  decisions  are  rooted  in  part  in  views  about
separation  of powers.  These  views  are  quite  distinct  from  notions  of
causation,  standing  by  themselves.  Three  central  ideas  support  the
separation-of-powers  concerns.  The first  is  a  belief that  courts  should
protect individual  rights  rather than  general  social interests;  the second
invokes  the  "take  Care"  clause  to  argue  against judicial  interference
with executive  implementation;  the  third  emphasizes  the availability  of
the  political  process  to  protect  interests  in  regulatory  enforcement.
These ideas  are  interrelated.  None  of them,  however,  supplies  a suffi-
cient  reason for a  refusal  to  treat probabilistic  or  systemic harms  as ju-
dicially  cognizable,  or indeed  for  a  general  reluctance  to  hear  actions
brought by  beneficiaries  to  bring about  regulatory  intervention.

1.  The  Question of Individual Rights. - There  is  considerable  ambi-
guity  in  the view  that  courts  should  protect  only  traditional  or individ-
ual  rights.  In  particular,  it  is  not  clear  whether  standing  is  to  be
eliminated  whenever  many  people  are  affected  by  the  decision,  or  in-
stead  when  an  interest  in  regulatory  protection-an  interest  not  pro-
tected  at common  law-is at stake.  If numbers  are  the crucial  concern,
standing would  be  foreclosed  not only  for regulatory  beneficiaries,  but
also  in cases  in  which many  people or businesses  are  the object  of gov-
ernment  control.  Such  cases  provide  the staple  of administrative  law;

consider,  for  example,  a  carcinogen  regulation  that  affects  numerous
industries  and  plants.  No  one  would  argue  that,  in  cases  of this  sort,
affected  industries  should  be  deprived  of access  to judicial  review  to
test the question  of legality.  Such a result would  mean  quite  generally
that the rulemaking  activity  of federal  agencies  could not be  subject  to
challenge from the objects  of regulation.  For this  reason, the claim  that
courts  should  protect  only  traditional  or  individual  rights  cannot  be
made  in  terms  of numbers  alone.' 8 2

It  is  quite  plausible  to  suggest  that  citizen  or  taxpayer  standing
ought  to be  unavailable,  certainly in  the absence of clear  congressional
authorization.18 3  A rule of that sort can  be supported  by the basic con-
sideration  that  underlies  the  injury-in-fact  requirement.  People  ordi-
narily  treated as bystanders  ought not to be  allowed  to disrupt mutually
advantageous  relations, 8 4  and  in  any  case  political  remedies  are  most
reliable when all  citizens are  affected  in the same way.  This assumption
is  part  of the set of prudential  limitations  on standing' 8 5-judge-made
clear statement  principles  that are subject to  congressional  override. l8 6
To  say  that  citizen  or taxpayer  standing  should  be  unavailable  is  not,
however,  to  say  that  when  large  numbers  of people  are  affected  by
agency  action,  they  should  be  remitted  to  political  remedies,  whether
they are beneficiaries  or  objects  of regulation.  In both cases,  the plain-
tiffs  are  seeking  to  require  administrators  to  comply  with  statutory  re-
quirements;  in  both cases,  the plaintiffs  represent  a subcategory  of the
citizenry;  and  in  both cases, judicial  relief should  be  available  to  bring
about  conformity  to  the  law. i8 7  Nothing  in  article  III  argues  against

182.  On  this  score,  the  analysis  in  SCRAP  is  correct.  See  SCRAP,  412  U.S.  at
686-88  ("To  deny  standing  to  persons  who  are  in  fact  injured  simply  because  many
others are also injured, would  mean that the most injurious  and widespread  government
actions  could  be  questioned  by  nobody.  We  cannot  accept  that  conclusion.").

183.  See  supra  note  105.
184.  See  supra notes  156-57  and accompanying  text.  The term "bystander"  is sub-
ject to  the  usual  qualification:  the  question whether  someone  is  a  bystander  cannot  be
decided  prelegally,  but  is  instead  a function  of the governing  legal  rules.

action  is  unlawful,  and  even if Congress  has expressly  granted  standing  in  such  cases.

rule  against  taxpayer  or  citizen  standing  is prudential  in  character,  and  the  grant  of
standing  to classes  of consumers  is designed to vindicate  statutory requirements  against
administrative  illegality.  It is  true  that all  citizens  are  in  a  sense  consumers,  id.,  but  in
the relevant  cases  a subgroup  of consumers  seeking  to purchase  a  particular product  is
contending  that  the agency  has  violated  statutory requirements.  It is no more plausible
to deny  standing  because  the  relevant  consumers  are  numerous  than  it  is  plausible  to

this  view,  and  the  APA  is  best  interpreted  to  grant  standing  in  both
cases,  even  if the  class  of plaintiffs  is  quite  large.

An alternative  view would  not emphasize  numbers,  but would  in-
stead  distinguish  sharply between  the injuries  of regulated  entities  and
those of regulatory beneficiaries.  But this view,  depending as it does  on
nineteenth  century  conceptions  of legal  harm,  cannot  be  sustained.' 8 8
Congress  has  abandoned  those  conceptions,  and  in light  of that aban-
donment,  the interests  of beneficiaries  are no more "general"  or "soci-
etal,"  and  no less  individual,  than  those  of regulated  entities.

2.  The  "Take  Care" Clause. -

It  is  possible  to  supplement  the  dis-
tinction  between  regulated  entities  and  regulatory  beneficiaries  with  a
reference  to  the "take  Care"  clause.' 8 9  On one view,  the clause makes
it  problematic  for  courts  to  compel  executive  implementation,  rather
than  to  prevent  agency  action.  In  the  former  case,  it might  seem  that
courts  are  usurping  the President's  power  to  "take  Care"  that  the laws
are  faithfully  executed.

The  "take  Care"  clause,  however,  is  a  duty,  not a  license. 190  The
clause  requires  the  President  to  carry  out  the  law  as  enacted  by  Con-
gress.  It does  accord  to the President-and  no  one  else-the authority
to control  the execution  of the law  when  Congress  has not spoken, and
that authority  will  involve  a measure  of discretion.  But the President's
discretion, and  the  "take  Care"  clause  in  general,  do not  authorize  the
executive branch  to violate the law  through insufficient  action any more
than  they  authorize  it  to  do  so  through  overzealous  enforcement.' 9 1

If administrative  action  is  legally  inadequate  or  if the  agency  has
violated  the law  by  failing to  act  at all, there  is no  usurpation  of execu-
tive  prerogatives  in ajudicial decision  to  that effect.' 92  Such a decision
is necessary in order to vindicate  congressional  directives,  as part of the

deny  standing  to  the objects  of carcinogen  regulation  because  the relevant  industry has

tives,  and  creates  odd  incentives  for  administrators);  infra  notes  205-32  (discussing

[Vol.  88:1432

and  concerns  of  separation  of powers  argue  in  favor  of rather  than
against a judicial  role when statutory beneficiaries  challenge  agency  be-
havior as  legally  inadequate.
3.  Political Redress. -

It is  not persuasive  to  respond  that  the legal
claims  of statutory  beneficiaries  are  properly  handled  in  the  political
process  and  not  in  the judiciary.  To  be  sure, judicial  review  must  be
seen as  only  a part of the network  of controls  on administrative  action.
It  is  a  large  mistake  to  focus  exclusively  on  the  courts.1 9 4  In  these
cases,  however,  the claim  is  that a  regulatory agency has  violated  a stat-
ute.  Arguments  that invoke  the primacy of the democratic  process  call
for judicial  involvement.  The  plaintiff is  seeking  to  compel  the  execu-
tive to  comply with  the political  resolution  as  it is  expressed  in law.  In
this  sense,  the problem  of standing presents  distinctive  considerations
in  the  statutory  realm.  Nor  is  there  a  reason  to  distinguish  between
these  claims  and  the legal  claims  of regulated  industries,  which  are  of
course  protected  through  the judiciary;  a  system  that  made  the courts
available  only  to  the latter would  be  hard  to  defend.

In addition,  the cases  at issue involve  legal, not political,  claims-a
point  often  missed  in  the  opinions.' 95  If  the  argument  is  genuinely
political  in  character,  the plaintiff will  lose on  some  ground  other than
standing-either  because  there  is  no  plausible  claim  on  the  merits,  or
because  the  decision  is  committed  to  agency  discretion  by  law.195  It is
true  that  cases  of this  sort  will  often  involve  a wide  range  of interests
and  a  number  of affected  parties.  That  fact  should  not,  however,  ob-
scure the  point that  the plaintiff's  objection  is  that  the agency has  vio-
lated  a  congressional  directive;  there  are  legally  cognizable  standards
by which  to  resolve  that issue. 19 7  Far better  devices  than  standing are

that  the  quotation  from  Allen  v.  Wright, see supra  note  142  and  accompanying  text,  is
largely a muddle.  The question in that case was  not whether courts  should be  " 'contin-
uing monitors of the wisdom  and soundness  of Executive action,'  "Allen,  468 U.S.  at 760
(quoting  Laird  v. Tatum,  408  U.S.  1, 15  (1972));  it was  whether  the  agency's  policies
violated  the  governing  statute.  See id.  at 784  (Stevens, J., dissenting).

194.  See  M. Reagan,  Regulation:  The  Politics  of Policy  113-17  (1987);  D. Riley,
Controlling the Federal Bureaucracy  159-60  (1987);  Sunstein, supra  note 21,  at 463-78.
195.  See  Allen,  468  U.S.  at 759-61;  Center  for  Auto  Safety  v. Thomas,  847  F.2d

(D.C.  Cir.  Sept.  16,  1988)  (en banc).

196.  Some  plaihtiffs  should,  however,  be precluded  from  bringing  suit  because of
the  generalized  character  of their claims.  See supra  note  179  and  accompanying  text.
197.  In  this  respect,  standing  issues  are  quite  different  in  the  constitutional  and
statutory realms.  It is at least plausible  to invoke such  limitations as a  prudential  notion
designed  to limit use  of the  Constitution  to  challenge legislative  or executive  behavior.
See A. Bickel,  supra  note 20,  at  116-27  (judiciary's  self-restraint  in not  granting stand-
ing reduces  clash between judiciary  and  other branches  and preserves  its  power).  Such
limitations  received  much  of their  impetus  from efforts  to insulate  New  Deal  programs
from intervention  from  ajudiciary perceived  to be hostile to regulation.  See supra notes
20-25 and  accompanying  text.  It is  far  less plausible  to invoke prudential  concerns  as  a
reason  to  shield administrative  agencies  from  congressional  limitations.

The  best  argument  in this  connection  would  emphasize  that  governing  legal stan-

1473

available  for  reducing  inappropriate  judicial  intrusions  in  such  cases,
including,  most prominently,  deference  on  the merits.

The most  general  point is  that there  is no  incompatibility  between
a system of administrative regulation  and a continued regime ofjudicial
control  of administrative  illegality. 198  Some  of current  law  reflects  an
emerging but still tentative belief-reminiscent  of the New  Deal-in ad-
ministrative  autonomy  from judicial  intrusions,  a  belief  that  is  sup-
ported  by similar  references  to  agency  expertise  and  accountability. 199
Here,  however,  the skepticism about judicial  intrusion is  typically  asso-
ciated  with  fear  that  courts  will  compel  rather  than  proscribe  adminis-
trative  regulation 2 0 0-a  peculiar reversal  of the New  Deal  concern  that
courts  would  invalidate,  on ideological  grounds,  necessary  administra-
tive  action.

From the standpoint  of the separation  of powers,  this  skepticism is
as  myopic as  its New  Deal  predecessor.  There  is  no  inconsistency  be-
tween  adherence  to  law  and  administrative  regulation,  even  if legal  in-
trusions  occasionally  produce  pathologies. 20  Statutory  requirements
will  sometimes  call  for  or  proscribe  agency  action.  Under  the  APA,
suits  by  those  with  a  legal  interest  or an  injury  in  fact  as  understood
here-including  both  beneficiaries  and  regulated  entities,  if anachro-
nistic  concepts  of  this  sort  are  to  be  used-should  therefore  be
permitted.

It  is,  moreover,  possible  to  read  the  recent  cases  relatively  nar-
rowly.  Both EKWRO  and Allen  involved efforts  by one  taxpayer  to  liti-
gate  the  tax  liability  of another.  In  neither  case,  moreover,  were  the
injuries  characterized  as  regulatory  harms.  Bakke, 20 2  the Center for Auto
Safety  cases, 20 3  and  other decisions 20 4  suggest  that under  some  consti-

dards  are  often  ambiguous  and  suggest  that  in  the  absence  of injury  to  an  object  of
regulation, outcomes  should be the product  of the political process,  as reflected in infor-
mal  interactions  involving  the  executive  branch,  legislative  authorities,  and  affected
groups.  This  argument is,  however,  hard to  defend  when  there  is an  injury in  fact to  a
regulatory  beneficiary  who  is  within  the  zone  of protected  interests.  See  supra  notes
182-88 and  accompanying  text (criticizing distinction  between  objects  and  beneficiaries
of regulation).

198.  The nature  ofjudicial  intrusion  must be  made  to accommodate  the  dynamics
of the  regulatory  process,  and  here  there is  considerable  room  for substantive  regula-
tory  change  and  reform  of the  approaches  of reviewing  courts.  See  Mashaw  & Harfst,
supra note  132,  at 312-16  (criticizing judicial review of rulemaking  in NHTSA context);
Stewart, supra note 87, at 683-85  (suggesting market  incentives  replace legal regulation
in certain  settings).

199.  See  supra  notes 20-25  and  accompanying  text.

involve  suits  brought  by  regulatory

beneficiaries.

D.  Injury, Causation, and Article III:  An  Excursus

Because  references  to  article  III  have  played  a  prominent  role  in
recent  standing decisions,  it is useful  to conclude with a brief treatment
of the relationship  between  the causation  requirements,  the characteri-
zation  of injuries,  and  the  case  or  controversy  requirement  of article
111.205

The  connection  between  standing  limitations  and  article  III  is  far
from  clear.  Article  III  limits  federal  'courts  to  cases  or  controversies,
but this  limitation does  not  explicitly require  that plaintiffs  have  a  par-
ticular  stake  in  the  outcome.  A  case  or  controversy  might  exist  quite
apart  from  whether  there  is  an  injury, legal  or otherwise,  to  the  com-
plainant.  To  explore  the  problem,  it  is  useful  to  distinguish  among
three  conceptions  of the relationship  between  article  III  and  standing
requirements.  The  first  view  would  allow  Congress  to  create judicially
cognizable  injuries whenever it chooses;  the second would  interpret  ar-
ticle  III  to  require  a  traditional  private  right;  the  third  would  impose
some limitations  on  congressional  power  to  create judicially  enforcea-
ble  rights,  but would  allow  courts  to  redress  regulatory  harms  of the
sort  involved  in  the Center for Auto  Safety  and  similar  cases.

On  the  first  view,  article  III  requires  a  case  or  controversy,  but
whether  there  is  a case  or  controversy  is  something  on which,  with re-
spect to  standing, article III is  silent.  The existence  of a case or contro-
versy  with  respect  to  standing  is  a  question  of  positive  law  and
therefore  for congressional  resolution.  Whether  there  is  standing  de-
pends  on  whether  positive  law  has  created  it  by  granting  a  cause  of
action  or  a  legal  right  or immunity  to  the  particular  plaintiff.  On  this
view,  article  III  does  require  standing  in  the form  of a legally  cogniza-
ble injury; but article  III does not say whether there is a legal injury in a
particular  case.  The  existence  of standing, like  the  existence  of prop-
erty, depends  on what the law provides. 20 6  Whether there is  a "case  or

205.  See  generally Berger, supra note  8,  at 827  (questioning the  historical accuracy
of the  "personal  stake"  element  of the  article  III  "case  or controversy"  requirement  in
Flast v.  Cohen);  Currie, Judicial  Review  Under  Federal  Pollution  Laws,  62  Iowa  L.  Rev.
1221,  1225-47  (1980)  (surveying requirements  for judicial  review  under  Glean  Air Act
and Federal  Water  Pollution  Control Act);  Currie, supra  note  103,  at  183-85  (criticizing
Court as "unnecessarily  stingy"  in  denying plaintiffs  standing in EKWRO);  Fallon, supra
note 5,  at 47-59  (arguing in  favor  of broad  congressional  power  to  create  legal  rights
and therefore  standing);Jaffe,  supra  note 8, at 1037-39  (arguing for a broader  definition
of "case  or  controversy").

206.  In  this  respect,  the problem  of standing is  distinct  from  the questions  of ripe-
ness,  mootness,  and  advisory  opinions.  The  latter requirements  are  not  wholly  within
congressional  control,  though  the  legislative  power  to  define  injury  includes  some

controversy"  is not answered  by article  III, but instead by Congress  and
the  Constitution  in  creating  legal  rights  and  obligations.

On  this  view,  moreover,  the  existence  of standing  and  the  exis-
tence of a  cause of action  present the same  basic  question.  And in  this
respect, the requirement of standing  serves an important separation-of-
powers  function,  by  ensuring  that  it  will  be  Congress,  rather  than  the
courts,  that  will  decide  who  may  bring  suit  against  the  government.
This  view  has  two  principal  implications.  The  first  is  that litigants  do
not  have  standing  unless  Congress  or  the  Constitution  has  granted
them  a  right to  bring  suit.  This  view draws  considerable  support  from
the first hundred and fifty years or so of the republic. 20 7  It also  receives
significant  though  not  unanimous  support  from  the  recent  cases. 20 8

power  over  these  requirements  as  well.  What  is  distinctive  about  standing  is  that  its
existence depends  on the creation  of a legal right.  While there may be some limitations
on  congressional  power to  create  standing,  those limitations,  if they exist,  are  quite in-
substantial.  See  infra  notes  221-32  and  accompanying  text.  In  all  of these  settings,
however,  the New Deal  reformation  has  large implications;  but the  general  relationship
between justiciability and  the rise  of the  administrative  state is  beyond  the scope  of the
present  discussion.

U.S.  737  (1984);  EKWRO,  426 U.S.  26 (1976).

When the objects  of regulation are seeking  to test the question of authorization,  it is
plausible  to understand previous  doctrine as having been rooted  in a belief that the due
process  clause  implicitly furnishes  a cause of action  to bring suit.  It was  on  this  under-
standing  that  courts  permitted  regulated  entities  to  challenge  unlawful  administrative
incursions  on  their  interests.  This  reading  of  the  cases  raises  interesting  questions
about more  modern and  more controversial  cases in which  plaintiffs  claim  that a consti-
tutional  provision  implicitly  creates  a cause  of action.  See, e.g.,  Bivens  v.  Six  Unknown
Named  Agents  of Fed. Bureau  of Narcotics,  403  U.S.  388,  390-92  (1971).  The  differ-
ence  is  that in  some  of the  most  controversial  of the  modern  cases,  damages  are  often
sought,  and it  may  be less  clear  that plaintiffs  are seeking  to fend  off unauthorized  gov-
ernmental  intervention;  but  that distinction  is  quite  thin.

On  this  view,  moreover,  some  of  the  cases  involving  standing  to  assert  constitu-
tional  claims  raise  the  question,  not  whether  there  is  injury  in  fact,  but  whether  the
relevant  provision  creates  a cause  of action.  Flast  v.  Cohen, 392  U.S.  83  (1968),  would
be  understood  as recognizing  an implied  cause of action  under the establishment  clause
when certain  conditions  are  met.  Valley  Forge Christian  College  v.  Americans  United
for Separation of Church  and  State, 454 U.S.  464  (1982),  denied  a cause of action when
those  conditions  were  not  met.  Bivens,  Flast, and  Valley  Forge thus  raise  closely  related
questions.  Furthermore,  the struggle over the characterization  of the plaintiff's  injury in
cases  involving  constitutional  claims  might  be understood  as part  of an effort  to define
the circumstances  in  which  constitutional  provisions  implicitly  create  causes  of action.
In  addition,  the  manipulable  character  of the  causation  requirements  in  constitutional
cases  might be defended  on the basis of the  (controversial) claim,  made most  notably in
A.  Bickel,  supra  note 20,  at  115-27,  that  courts  use  doctrines  of justiciability  so  as  to
control  the  amount  and  timing  of their intervention  into  the  democratic  process.  The
discussion in  the text, however,  deals  with  the question whether and  when  the Constitu-

The  second  implication  is  that  if Congress  has  granted  such  a  right,
there  is  no  problem  under  article  III.

Notably,  the  pre-Data Processing view  of standing  largely  incorpo-
rates  this  understanding  of article  111.209  The legal-interest  test reflects
a  conception  of standing  that  draws  an  inference  of congressional  in-
tent to  allow the plaintiffs'  action to  go  forward  on the basis of the con-
gressional  desire  to  protect  their  interests  in  the  regulatory  process.

There is much to be said in favor of this  view of article 111.210  Inso-
far as  it suggests  that the problem  of standing is largely within congres-
sional  control,  it  seems  to  be  correct  as  a  matter  of both  history  and
logic.  The  basic  position  has,  moreover,  been  accepted  explicitly  or
implicitly  in  a  number  of recent  decisions  by  the  Supreme  Court.2 11
Those  decisions  recognize  that the problem  of standing is,  in adminis-
trative-law  cases,  governed by the APA, 21 2 and that Congress  can  create
standing  if it  chooses. 2 13  In  this  view,  Congress  can  create  a  legal  in-
jury  where  none  had  existed  before.  Consider  the  fact  that  the  Free-
dom  of Information  Act  creates  a  cause  of action  for  "any  person, 2 14
and  that  the  injury,  thus  defined,  has  raised  no  constitutional  prob-
lem. 21 5  Consider  also  the  legislative  creation  of citizens'  suits  under
various statutes 216  and  the creation  of legal injuries  quite  foreign to the
common  law. 2 17

tion  permits  Congress  to  create  a cause  of action,  not  with  the  quite  distinct  question
whether  the Constitution  creates  a cause  of action  of its  own  force.

STANDING

1477

For the most  part,  the question  of standing  therefore  involves  the
meaning  of congressional  enactments. 2 18  The Data Processing require-
ment  of "injury  in  fact"  has  confused  this  point.  But it is  notable  that
the  Supreme  Court has  also  said  that  this  requirement  is  a  creation  of
Congress  in enacting the APA, emphasizing  that the APA  generally  cre-
ates  standing  for  those  whb  are  harmed,  and  that  there  need  be  no
separate  indication  of  congressional  intent  to  create  a  cause  of  ac-
tion.2 1 9  The downfall  of the legal interest  test in Data Processing is  thus
an  interpretation  of the  APA, 220  and  the  problem  of standing  in  this
sense  remains  within  congressional  control.

The claim  that the problem  of standing is for congressional  resolu-
tion might be  thought to run into  two sorts  of constitutional  objections.
First,  the denial  of standing, like  the denial  of judicial  review, 22 1  might
sometimes  raise serious problems  under the due process  clause  or arti-
cle  III.  If, for example,  Congress  provided  that  those  subject  to  envi-
ronmental  regulation could not seek review  of the regulation,  a serious
problem  would  arise  under  the  Constitution.  In  the  modem  period,
the  same  proposition  may  sometimes  hold  for  regulatory  benefi-
ciaries. 22 2  From  this  direction,  one  can  find a  limitation, even  if a rela-

of Fair Housing  Act  of  1968  "establishes  an  enforceable  right  to  truthful  information
concerning  the availability  of housing");  Trafficante, 409  U.S.  at 212  (Civil  Rights  Act  of
1968  creates  right to protection  against  housing discrimination).

218.  See Clarke  v.  Securities  Indus.  Ass'n,  107  S.  Ct.  750,  754  (1987)  (describing
the  problem  in Data Processing as  "basically  one of interpreting  congressional  intent");
id. at  755 n.9,  757,  758  n.16  (emphasizing  that availability  of standing is  different  from
availability  of implied  cause of action  because  of broad  purposes of standing  provision
of APA).

219.  See  id.
220.  But seeJ. Vining, supra note  1, at 39-41;  supra notes  36-37 and  accompany-

ing text.

221.  See supra  note  34  and  accompanying  text.
222.  The  denial  of standing to regulatory  beneficiaries  would  be most likely  to run
into  constitutional  obstacles  if the  benefit is individual rather  than collective.  The issues
would  be  (a) whether  the  due  process  clause  requires judicial  review of the administra-
tive  determination  and  (b)  whether  article  III  requires  some  role for a  federal  court  in
supervising  the  administrative  decision.  See  Fallon,  supra  note  32,  at  963-67;  cf.
Webster v.  Doe,  108 S.  Ct. 2047,  2051-52  (1988)  (construing CIA statute so as to permit
judicial  review  of constitutional  claims);  id.  at 2058-60  (Scalia, J., dissenting)  (arguing
that  there  is  no  general  right  to judicial  review);  Goldberg  v.  Kelly,  397  U.S.  254,
260-61  (1970)  (welfare benefits  qualify as property  for purposes  of procedural  due pro-
cess).

If the answer  to either question is in the affirmative,  a legislative repeal of the stand-
ing  provisions  of the  APA,  or  a  general  effort  to  insulate  administrators  from judicial
review,  would  run into  serious  constitutional  difficulty-unless  heavy  reliance  is  placed
on  the  distinction  between  legislative  and  adjudicative  determinations.  Compare  Bi-
Metallic Inv. Co.  v.  State Bd.  of Equalization,  239  U.S. 441,  445  (1915)  (taxpayer  has no
due  process  right  to  a  hearing  when  tax  is  part  of general  statute  within  state  power)

tively  unimportant  one  in practice, 223  on  the claim  that the question  of
standing  is  for  congressional  resolution.

The  second  constitutional  objection  is  that  the grant  of standing
might  sometimes  be  thought  to  raise  questions  under  article  III-an
objection  that  can  be  generalized  into  a  second  and  different  view  of
the relationship  between  article III  and standing requirements.  On this
view, article III does  impose substantive limitations  on the sorts of inju-
ries that  can  be  redressed  in federal  court.  Only injuries  to  nineteenth
century  individual  rights-those  that  are,  or  that  resemble,  common-
law  harms-can  be  remedied  by  the  judiciary.  Congress  is  without
power to allow  federal courts  to  remedy certain  sorts of injuries,  even  if
it attempts  to  create  a  cause  of action  to  do  precisely  that.  This  view
takes various  forms. 224  In all of those forms, however,  the central  point
is  plain:  article III  allows  federal  courts  to vindicate  some injuries  and
not  others,  and  the  line  between  them  depends  on  traditional  concep-
tions  of what  constitutes  a legal  harm.

Some  of the Court's  decisions  offer  support  for  this  view,  appear-
ing  to  conflate  APA  and  constitutional  standards, 22 5  to  require  a judi-
cially  approved  injury in  fact no  matter what Congress  has  said, and  at
least  to imply  that the Constitution  disallows standing  even if Congress
has  created  it.226  For this  reason, it is  controversial  to  claim  that there
are  no  limitations  on  congressional  power  to  grant  standing.  To  be
sure, any  such limitations  should  come  up  infrequently  even  if they  ex-
ist.  But  on  one  view,  the requirement  of an  injury  in  fact  stems  from

determination  of the  tax  to  a  subordinate  body,  taxpayer  has  due  process  right  to  a
hearing).

There would  be  no  anomaly  in  a constitutional  order  that  permitted  Congress  to
grant standing freely  but limited its power  to deny it.  A principle of that sort is  rooted in
the idea,  with  powerful  roots  in  current  law,  that  whether  there  is  a legal  "case"  is a
function of positive law,  but that  there are  constitutional  limits  on  Congress's  power  to
authorize administrative  officials  to make unreviewable  decisions  about legal  rights.  But
a  detailed  exploration  of  these  complex  issues  is  beyond  the  scope  of  the  present
discussion.

223.  The  background  rule recognized  in  the APA,  allowing  standing for regulated
entities  and  beneficiaries,  means  that  the  constitutional  objection  will  come  up  quite
rarely, if at all.

224.  Thus  it  might be said  that  Congress  is  without  power  to authorize  courts  to
remedy  probabilistic  or systemic  harms,  or  that courts  may  redress  only injuries  of the
sort cognizable at common  law, or, more narrowly, that article III forbids  Congress from
conferring on citizens  a  right to vindicate  merely ideological  claims.  On  the latter  view,
Sierra Club  v. Morton, 405 U.S.  727  (1972),  is properly decided as a matter of article III,
but  Congress  has  the  constitutional  power  to  overrule  the  decisions  in,  for  example,
Allen v.  Wright, 468  U.S.  737 (1984),  EKWRO, 426 U.S.  26 (1976),  and Warth  v. Seldin,
422  U.S.  490  (1975).

ever,  quite ambiguous  on  this  point.  See supra  note  208.

article  III;  it forbids  courts  to redress  or prevent  regulatory  harms;  and
the requirement  cannot  be  overcome  by  statute.

That  view  is,  however,  misguided. 22 7  The  best  interpretation  of
article  III  would  recognize  that  Congress  has  the  authority  to  define
legal rights and obligations,  and that it may therefore, by statute,  create
an injury  in fact  where,  as far  as  the legal  system  was  concerned,  there
had been no injury before.  Article III does  not require an injury in fact,
even  if the APA  does,  and article  III  certainly  does  not require  a  tradi-
tional private right.  Article III requires a case  or controversy, a concept
that  depends  on  the  acts  of Congress.  Many  of the  Court's  decisions
appear  to  recognize  this  point. 2 28

In  this respect,  the question  whether an injury is merely ideological
or  instead  legal  is  one  of positive  law;  there  is  no  pre-  or  post-legal
metric  for  distinguishing  between  the  two.  This  view  draws  support
from  the  original  understanding  of the  case-or-controversy  require-
ment.2 29  It  also  draws  support  from  the view,  prominent  in  the  post-
New  Deal period as  well as  in the founding  era,  that whether  there is  a
case  or controversy,  or a  legal  injury and  legal  right, cannot  be  under-
stood independently  of what  the law  provides.  The modem  network  of
legal  rights may  or may  not closely  resemble  the sorts  of interests  pro-
tected  at  common  law,  and  nothing  in  the  Constitution  requires  that
they  do  so.  There  is  much  to  be  said,  then,  in  favor  of the view  that
article  III  does  not limit  Congress'  power  to  grant  standing,  and  that
the only limitations, grounded  in article III  and the due  process clause,
are  those  that  prohibit  Congress  from  denying  standing  in  certain
cases.  The  contrary  position  is  based  on  a peculiar  and  quite  modem
revisionist  reading  of the  Brandeis-Frankfurter  effort-itself revision-
ist-to  immunize  administrative  regulation  from judicial  control. 23 0

Like  the second view,  and unlike  the first, the third approach  reads
article  III  as  imposing  substantive  limitations  on  the  sorts  of injuries
that plaintiffs  may  invoke;  but it would  allow  courts  to  redress  injuries
that do not in any sense resemble  those recognized at common law.  On
this  view,  Congress  could  not  enact  a  statute  providing, for  example,
that  all  citizens  may  bring  suit  to  redress  all  official  illegality.  The  re-
quirement  of an  injury  in  fact  is  thus  constitutional  in  status;  it  is  not
solely an  interpretation  of the APA;  and  merely ideological  or  law  en-
forcement  interests  cannot  be  converted  into  legal  harm  by  legislative

fiat. 23 1  On  the  other  hand,  this  third  view  would  allow  systemic  or
probabilistic  harms  to be redressed if Congress  has created  a  regulatory
system  to reduce  or eliminate  those harms.  If article  III is to  be under-
stood  as  imposing  substantive  limitations  on  the  sorts  of injuries  that
may  suffice  for  federal jurisdiction,  this  third position  is  preferable  to
the second-even  though, for reasons  suggested above,  the best view  is
that  article  III  permits  Congress  to  create  standing as  it  chooses.

It would be ironic indeed  if article  III were interpreted  to preclude
federal  courts  from  compelling  regulatory  agencies  to  adhere  to  the
will  of Congress  by undertaking  enforcement  action  to the degree  or of
the nature  that statutes  require.  Such  an interpretation would  be remi-
niscent,  above  all, of the early  period  of administrative  law, when  con-
stitutional  provisions  were  similarly  interpreted  so  as  to  frustrate
regulatory  initiatives  in  deference  to  private-law  understandings  of the
legal  system.2 32

CONCLUSION

The  rise  of administrative  regulation  was  a deliberate  rejection  of
common-law principles.  In particular, regulatory regimes  often repudi-
ated  common-law baselines  for distinguishing between  inaction  and ac-
tion,  or  neutrality  and  partisanship.  In  these  circumstances,  it  is  not
surprising  that the principles  governing  legal  control  of administrative
behavior  have  largely  abandoned  common-law  categories,  allowing
courts  to  remedy  violations  of statutorily protected  interests.

Recent  decisions  by  the  Supreme  Court  and  some  lower  courts,
however,  threaten  to reintroduce  a sharp  distinction  between  the inter-
ests of regulatory beneficiaries  and  those of regulated  entities,  a distinc-
tion  that  would  move  the law  not  only  toward  the  period  before  Data
Processing, but  toward  anachronistic  understandings  that  restricted  the
category  of legally  cognizable  interests  to  nineteenth  century  private
rights.  The recent  use of the causation  requirements  has been justified
as  an  inference  from the system  of separation  of powers,  but it is  more
realistically  understood  as an  outgrowth of a private-law  model of pub-
lic  law,  one  that stems  not  from a  belief in judicial  restraint  in  the  ab-
stract,  but  instead  from  hostility  to  suits  brought  by  beneficiaries  of
regulatory  programs  to ensure fidelity to statute.  The reintroduction  of
such  hostility would  not only be inconsistent with  a wide range of cases
pointing  in  the  direction  of an  independent  public  law;  it  would  also
contradict  the text  and  history  of article  III,  fly  in  the face  of congres-
sional  understandings  and expectations,  and skew  administrative  incen-
tives  in  undesirable  directions.

231.  The view that Congress  should be entitled  to define legal  rights as it wishes  is,
however,  supported by judicial acceptance  of various  provisions  furnishing  citizens'  suits
against  public  and  private  actors.  See  supra  note  77.

STANDING

1481

Such a  step should  be firmly  resisted.  For the most  part, the ques-
tion of standing is for legislative  resolution.  Because  the constitutional
constraints  are  thin,  the  law  of  standing  has  generally  depended  on
congressional  intent, which  must sometimes  be extrapolated  on the ba-
sis  of background  understandings  about the circumstances  in which ju-
dicial  relief ought  to  be  presumed  to  be  available.

In  the  1970s,  the Supreme  Court  interpreted  the APA  as  granting
standing  to  almost  all  those  actually  harmed  by  administrative  illegal-
ity2 3 3 -an  interpretation that departed  from the  original  understanding
of the APA,  but that  can be  understood  in  a way  that  is  largely consis-
tent  with  the basic  purposes  of that statute,  and  that  placed  the prob-
lem  of standing  in  the  control  of Congress,  where  it  largely  belongs.
Neither  the APA  nor article  III need  be  interpreted  to make  common-
law conceptions  of injury  controlling  in public-law  cases.  The  develop-
ment  of a  set  of independent, principles  of public  law  is  a  large  task
indeed;  but  in  the  context  of itanding,  a  revival  of private-law  ideas,
coexisting  with  administrative  regulation,  would  be  singularly  ill-
conceived.

233.  The  qualification  is  necessary  because  (a) the  "zone"  test  prevented  suit  by
those whose  interests  were entirely  far afield  of the statute  and  (b) the injury-in-fact  test
had to be interpreted  in such  a way  as to exclude  suits by  those incidentally or indirectly
harmed.
