      <p>O'Connor'srecentrulingupholdingthe affirmative

      <p>In a symposiumentitled"Hasthe SupremeCourtGone

RobertH. Borkwrites:"Judiciailnventionof new
andpreviously unheard-ofrightsacceleratedover the past
halfcenturyand has now reachedwarp speed. The list of
activistdecisionsconstitutionalizintghe
left-liberaclultural agendais lengthy."</p>
      <p>Referringto the Grutterruling,RobertL. Bartley,now
columnistfor The WallStreetJournal,wrotethatJustice
O'Connor'sstanceis "ludicrous.B"artleygoes on to
concludethattheCourt'smajorityadmitsthat"weareissuing

socialsituationt,hispartof theConstitutio nis
herebysuspended.If I had investedmy life in the law,I wouldfind
this,if nothorrifyinga,tleastdisgusting."
historicalscholarshipsuggests thatthe framersandratifiers
of the FourteenthAmendment did not mean to condemn
effortsto assistAfricanAmericansas such. JusticeThomas
and his fellow dissenters are certainlyentitled to say that
affirmativeaction is bad policy. But they should not read
theirown views into the Constitution.The Court'smajority
was correct,in Grutter,to allow the law school to continue
with its program.
"What'swrong with explicitness? Whydoes the
Constitution requireadmissions offices to hide the
ball?"</p>
      <p>In Gratz,the Courtsaidthatthe undergraduatperogramat
the Universityof Michigan was invalidbecause it was too
inflexible. Underthatprogram,applicantswere given
specified "points"toward admission. A student with 100-150
points would definitely be admitted; those with 75-99
remainedin contention.Points could be awardedbased on
standardizedtest scores, high school grades, alumni
relationship,personalessay, strengthof high school, and more.
82
An applicantwho came from an underrepresentedminority
group would be awarded 20 points toward admission.</p>
      <p>Nonminoritystudentswould receive 20 points for athletic
ability, socioeconomic disadvantage, or attendance at a
socioeconomically disadvantagedhigh school. Applicants
would also receive 10 points for being residents of
Michigan,5 for leadershipand service, 5 for artistictalent,
and so on.
"Whatthe Court is requiring is a costly system of
individual discretion in which race does count as a factor,
but in which the university is not permitted to be
candid, even to itself, about how much of a factor it is."</p>
      <p>The Court'smajorityobjectedthatthis point system failed
to provide individualizedconsiderationto each applicant.</p>
      <p>Whether or not the system was a quota, the Court
complained,it "automaticallydistributes20 points to every
single applicantfrom"a minoritygroup.In the Court'sview,
this automaticdistributionof points has the effect of
making the factor of race a decisive one "for virtually every
minimally qualifiedunderrepresentedminorityapplicant."
The Universityof Michigan contendedthatbecause of the
sheer volume of applications,individualizedconsideration
of each applicantwould be impractical.To this the Court
respondeddismissively: "Thefact thatthe implementation
of a programcapableof
providingindividualizedconsiderationmight presentadministrativechallengesdoes not
renderconstitutionalan otherwiseproblematicsystem."</p>
      <p>I believethattheoutcomein Gratzis mostunfortunateT. he
initial problem is that in principlethe programupheld in
Grutteris no more objectionablethanthe one in Gratz.The
majordistinctionis thattheundergraduatseystemused
numbers, ratherthan a system of individualdiscretion.But this
shouldnot make a constitutionaldifference.In tryingto get
minoritystudents,thelaw schoolwas probablyas aggressive
as the undergraduatperogramwas. The law school avoided
numbers,to be sure;butits
admissionsofficersusedthepractical equivalentof numbersin exercisingtheirdiscretionto
ensurethatenoughminoritystudentswere able to attendits
law school.The SupremeCourtfoundit crucialthatthe law
school didnot makeexplicitthe weightthatit gave to
minority applicants,whereas the undergraduateprogramdid so.</p>
      <p>But what's wrong with explicitness? Why does the
Constitutionrequireadmissionsoffices to hide the ball?</p>
