Dollars and Death
Eric A. Posner* and Cass R. Sunstein**
How should the legal system assign dollar values to human lives? Consider a highly publicized example.
On September 22, 2001, Congress enacted legislation to compensate the survivors of the attacks of eleven days earlier.1 Under the final regulations,2 survivors were permitted to claim amounts for both economic and non-economic losses. The economic losses were to be measured by calculating each victim?s expected lost wages from

regulations affect people compensation, especially for family members, regulatory policy is designed to produce optimal levels of risk. This point contains compensation of those still living?a focus that naturally leads to disregard of the deceased, an emphasis on what the plaintiffs have lost, and an interest in a set of highly individuated awards. By contrast, regulatory policy, which has assigned monetary values to statistical lives for little more than two decades, is concerned above all with producing the right deterrent signal, a concern that might seem to explain the use of a single, uniform number for the valuation of what most matters: the loss of life. But as a full account of the differences, this explanation is much too simple.14 Tort law does and should provide deterrence as well as compensation, and if wrongful death actions

wrongful death.
Because administrative costs are high (and also because of political constraints on inequality18), more uniformity is inevitable but how much? One of the most noteworthy features of the comparative exercise is that agencies opt for uniformity, whereas courts call for a high degree of individuation. Undoubtedly this difference is partly a function of the ex post focus of wrongful death actions and the ex ante focus of regulation. But it would be most surprising if the radical difference, on this count, could be justified by that difference in perspective.
We believe that both bodies of law can learn a great deal from the other.19 In particular, we suggest five large-scale reforms. First, agencies should move in the direction of the more individuated approach of tort law. They should not use a uniform number per life saved. In addition, they should consider pain and suffering, dread,20 and loss to dependents. These changes would make a dramatic difference for administrative Second, courts should move in the direction of administrative regulation by taking account of the welfare loss to the decedent. This change would significantly alter wrongful death cases, by producing far higher recoveries in many cases. Third, agencies should move in the direction of courts by including the emotional distress and other welfare losses incurred by dependents courts should not ignore losses of support for dependents (as agencies do), but they should offer more accurate and fine-grained understandings of that figure. These changes would increase the stringency of administrative regulations and promote less arbitrary figures from courts. Fourth, both courts and agencies should change their valuation of the deaths of children by taking the child?s welfare loss seriously while also accounting for the possibility of offsetting
behavior by parents. Fifth, agencies and courts should evaluate mortality risks that are imposed on foreigners?both resident aliens and nonresident aliens whose mortality is affected by domestic activities?in a manner that is consistent with the diplomatic objectives of the political branches.
This Article is organized as follows. Part I provides the background from both tort law and regulatory policy. Part II discusses the theoretical basis for valuing human lives. Part III investigates a range of methodological difficulties and implications. Part IV proposes reforms to tort law and regulatory policy. Part V explores the question why tort law and regulatory policy currently take such different approaches to valuing loss of life.
I. Background result of the tort prior to death, and also for the distress and loss of companionship
A. How Tort Law Values Loss of Life
At common law, victims (that is, their estates) and dependents could not recover damages for wrongful death. As a result, courts did not face the problem of calculating damages for loss of life. In the nineteenth century, however, many states enacted statutes that provided for recoveries. Wrongful death statutes provided that dependents, including spouses and children, may recover damages for lost support. Survival statutes provided that the victim?s estate may recover damages for certain losses that the victim incurred as a result of the tort, such as medical expenses and earnings lost between injury and death.21 Today, most states have one or both types of statutes, or statutes that combine elements of each type. In addition, there has been much judge-created common law that can be traced to these statutes. As a general proposition, one can say that courts now award damages on account of death caused by a tort, but the rules vary widely by jurisdiction.
Despite the variations, there are common themes. Most courts award ?noneconomic? damages, that is, damages for pain and suffering incurred by the victim as a
suffered by dependents or heirs.23 All states award ?economic? damages. In states that use the ?loss to dependents? measure, these damages are supposed to make dependents whole roughly, they provide the support that dependents would have received if the victim had lived. This may be measured as lost contributions from victims to dependents (housing, hedonic damages. Plaintiffs suing on behalf of a victim who has no future income, no
no spouse, and who dies without feeling pain, should ordinarily receive
funeral expenses.25 This large category
food, and so forth), or, more crudely, future income minus victim?s expenses. In states that use the ?loss to estate? measure, damages are supposed to approximate the victim?s estate if she had lived a natural life?total future income minus expenses.24
Notice that the non-economic and economic measures do not provide an award for the loss of life per se?that is, the victim?s ?loss of life?s pleasure,? also known as dependents, and zero damages or damages sufficient only to cover of people includes elderly people who are living off savings and unemployed or homeless people. It also includes homemakers, unless an implicit value is assigned to household services. And it includes children?at least in ?loss to dependent? states, because children do not have dependents who lose support as a result of their death.26
Of course, this is a matter of formal law in practice, damages are often awarded on account of the deaths of people who have no income, and often damages are in excess of lost income. This is partly because non-economic damages will be available in most cases, partly because juries are given a great deal of discretion to award damages in wrongful death cases and are provided little guidance by courts, and partly because courts use fictions in order to ensure a ?reasonable? recovery.27 But if all this is true, then
damages for wrongful death are highly arbitrary,28 and indeed this is the conventional wisdom,29 supported by our own evidence as discussed below.30
Only five states permit damages for hedonic loss: Arkansas,31 Connecticut,32 Hawaii,33 New Hampshire,34 and New Mexico.35 As a matter of theory, plaintiffs in these states can recover damages on account of the wrongful death of people who have no income and otherwise would not be entitled to non-economic damages. However, the statutes and judicial opinions in these states do not explain the methodology, and judges usually leave the calculation to the jury, with lax oversight.36 In some cases, courts appear to misunderstand the nature of hedonic loss?for example, confusing it with lost income.37
The upshot is that it is exceptionally hard to predict, as a matter of formal law, what damages for wrongful death will be in any particular case. However, verdict and settlement data can be used to paint a rough picture. We examined data from two data sets: (1) an unscientific Jury Verdict and Settlement data set that provides a wealth of information about the characteristics of the cases (?JVS?)38 and (2) a more scientific
Civil Justice System data set that contains little information about the characteristics of cases (?CJS?).39
Table 1 provides some examples from the JVS data set these examples are selected to show the range of real world outcomes.

Hence two points emerge from the wrongful death cases. The first is that in principle, the law calls for a highly individuated approach, one that recognizes a wide range of factors that bear on the degree of loss to dependents. The second is that in practice, actual awards on account of loss of life are usually well below $3 million and also characterized by great variance.
B. How Regulatory Policy Values Loss of Life
As we have noted, agencies now assign monetary values to human lives. The practice is recent, having become systematized only as a result of an executive order from 1981.48 For a period, agency figures were highly and inexplicably variable.49 With some exceptions, however, most regulatory agencies have now converged on a fairly narrow range for the valuation of life: $5 million to $6.5 million. Consider the following table, accounting for agency valuations in the recent past:

C. A Comparison: The September 11 Victim Compensation Fund
As we mentioned at the outset, the September 11 Fund was influenced by tort principles, and it is instructive to compare the awards to dependents of deceased victims of the September 11 attacks both with tort wrongful death awards and with agency valuations of life. Table 3 displays the comparison.

(2) the much higher average income of the September 11 victims compared to that of the general population. Putting aside the outliers, then, the Sept. 11 Fund and tort awards seem largely consistent, and both are much lower than agency valuations. What the Sept. 11 Fund shares with agency valuations is the much lower degree of variance than that found in the tort system.

A. Tort Law and Deterrence
1. Principles of Tort Damages
The tort not always, the two purposes lead in similar directions. If the victim of a wrongful death action cannot be compensated, deterrence is still a possibility. The question we now investigate is what level of damages produces optimal deterrence of wrongful death. Our task: a monetary amount, before any harm occurs, that is the multiple of the magnitude of
the harm and its probability, assessed for every person who is made to face the relevant risk or a monetary amount, after the harm occurs, that reflects the magnitude of the harm. The choice between the two approaches largely depends on questions of administrability.60
To understand how deterrence works, one must take an ex ante perspective.61

the victim incurs an expected loss of pL at Suppose and what level of care to take and at time 3 injuries damages are determined for wrongful death actions. On the deterrence approach, we want to choose legal rules at time 1 that produce damages at time 3 that give everyone optimal incentives at time 2.
As is well known, people can be given optimal incentives to take care if they are required to pay damages for any financial losses that they cause (or negligently cause).62 Imagine, for example, that a particular behavior, such as driving, will cause $1000 in losses if an accident occurs. A driver can control the probability that the loss will occur by taking more or less care. The cost of care increases with the taken. The efficient level of care is the amount at which the marginal cost of care equals the expected marginal cost of an accident. By requiring the tortfeasor to pay damages, the law forces the driver to internalize the losses that she creates, and so she will take precautions when the costs of those precautions are less than the expected losses.63
We can think of the victim?s loss in two equivalent victim ?ex post? loss. Alternatively, we can say that
time 1, where p is the probability of the accident at time 3. This is the ?ex ante? loss. From an economic perspective, these losses are equivalent. If an insurance market exists, people are assumed to be indifferent between being awarded pL, as potential victims, at time 1, and L, as actual victims, at time 3.64 Insurers will set the premium equal to pL,
insurance premium, and simply collect from the driver under the
that the (multiply unfortunate!) victim of the wrongful death tort has and they will pay out L if the accident occurs. Tort law, in theory, could either require all drivers to pay all potential tort victims pL at time 1, or (as in fact) only drivers who cause accidents to pay only actual victims L at time 3. If the insurer is subrogated (as is usually the case), then the victim is indifferent between these two systems, as is the insurer. Potential victims who want insurance can use their ?damages? of pL under the first system to pay for the second system without going through the insurance intermediary. Potential victims who do not want insurance could purchase an investment instrument that pays pL at time 1 in return for the chance of L at time 3.65
Why does the tort system award damages of L to actual victims rather than damages of pL to potential victims, when the two awards are equivalent? A large part of the answer is one of practicality. Potential victims cannot be easily identified in advance, and many risks are difficult or even impossible to calculate. In the unusual cases when the reverse is true?when courts cannot award L to actual victims because the loss will occur in the distant future?some courts have been willing to force potential tortfeasors to pay potential victims damages equal to pL.66 Thus, tort law does not, in principle, bar awards of pL rather than L its focus on L stems from the fact that L is a far simpler foundation for judicial decisions.
2. Valuing Loss of Life
Now let us turn to the problem of measuring L when the loss is death. To fix intuitions, suppose no dependents, no spouse, no friends, and no income suppose too that the death was instant, involving no pain, suffering, dread, or medical expenses. Putting aside funeral
expenses, most courts would be required by law to award zero damages, which is a serious puzzle.
How should we think about valuing the loss of life? One thought is that the loss of life should be valued at infinity because most people would not accept any amount of money in exchange for their lives. If L?the loss?is infinite, then the product pL is infinite as well. But this answer mistakes the relevant inquiry, which involves probabilities of death, not death itself. Designate a new variable R, which refers to the amount a person is willing to pay to avoid a particular risk of death. When a new risk is created?say, a new kind of manufacturing process creates new sources of pollution, producing a new risk of 1/500,000 in the area?everyone who incurs this risk suffers a loss of welfare, which can be measured as R. If the person can pay to avoid this risk? say, by moving?then he will pay any amount of money up to R. R is thus the ex ante payment to avoid the risk of death.
It is desirable for potential tortfeasors to take account of this loss, R, for the same reason that it is desirable for them to take account of any other pecuniary or nonpecuniary loss.67 This can be done in two ways. All potential tortfeasors can be required to pay R to every potential victim (that is, all people who incur the new risk of death). Alternatively, tortfeasors who actually cause the death of particular victims can be forced to pay an amount of money only to those victims (their estates or dependents, or even to the state) such that the expected cost for the potential tortfeasor is R.68 Assuming sufficient information, that amount is easily calculated. If victims are willing to pay R in order to avoid the risk, and the risk itself?that is, the probability of death, is q?then the proper
potential victims are willing to pay $600 in order level of damages is R/q. For example, if to avoid the risk of death, and the risk of death is 1/10,000, then their estates or
dependents should recover $6 million (at time 3). This is equivalent from the deterrence perspective to the first alternative, that of forcing tortfeasors to pay all potential victims
welfare or utility a dead person has, or how much elfare denied damages for wrongful death prior to the enactment of wrongful death and survival $600 (at time 1).
The amount R/q?$6 million, in our example?is often called the value of a statistical life (VSL), but it is important to see that the number is just a construct, designed to represent the cost of being subject to the risk of death, and not the value of human life in the ordinary sense. In fact the term ?value of a statistical life,? though in common use,69 is actually quite misleading. What is really involved is the assignment of monetary values to death risks?an assignment of the sort that occurs, though almost always without formal calculation, whenever people run risks or take steps to reduce the risks that they face (as, for example, by purchasing smoke alarms or Volvos).
The point to understand is that in order to calculate optimal damages for wrongful death, we do not need to ask how much w or utility declines when a person dies. From a deterrence perspective, it is sufficient to focus on the decline in welfare that results when a person is subjected to the risk of death. The assignment of a monetary value to mortality risks is an effort to ensure that focus.
B. Tort Law and Compensation
In tort cases involving easily measured losses, the deterrence and compensation goals are joined in an intuitively satisfying way. The tort victim who loses $1000 obtains damages of $1000. The tort victim is fully compensated, and optimal deterrence is achieved.70 In wrongful death cases, however, there appears to be a disjunction between the compensation and the deterrence goals. The dead person cannot be compensated?she is dead. Because of the compensatory focus of tort law, this may be the reason that courts statutes. Hence courts attempt to achieve the compensatory goals of modern tort law by focusing on the losses of survivors. We think that the attempt is inadequate and that courts can do much better.
Although dead people cannot be compensated, it is incorrect to say that tort law cannot, with respect to victims, achieve its compensation goal in the wrongful death context. Compensation is possible in such cases once it is understood that the tort involves

imposition of the risk of death.71
To see why, imagine that courts adopted the alternative ex ante system of liability: all potential tortfeasors pay damages equal to R to all potential victims in time 1. If this were the normal system, then people would be compensated for being forced to undergo heightened risks of death. They would be compensated in the same sense as workers who are given hazard pay in return for voluntarily undertaking some risky task.72
Now consider the regular ex post system. By awarding the victim?s estate R/q, the court does not compensate the victim in a straightforward sense: you cannot compensate someone who is dead. But suppose that the victim has a life insurance policy, which provides that the insurer is subrogated to any claims that the victim?s estate has in case of wrongful death. In addition to getting the regular benefits of a life insurance policy, all potential victims who have life insurance would receive R in the form of the reduction in the life insurance premium. Because the insurer has the right to R/q in case of a wrongful death, it will reduction. In short, the risky behavior imposes 1, but at the same time all potential victims are compensated via the intermediation of an insurance company at time 1.73 Thus, tort law can serve its compensatory function in wrongful death cases, albeit in an indirect way and only with the help of a market intermediary.74
To be sure, this is not what people usually mean by compensation in tort cases. The usual notion is that if one person commits a wrongful act that injures another person,
the wrongdoer should compensate the victim for the loss. This principle yields straightforward legal results in ordinary cases. If the tortfeasor destroys the victim?s automobile, then damages should equal the value of the automobile or the cost of replacing it. Such damages would make the victim whole. However, damages cannot

is that people know that compensate the victim of a wrongful death tort because the money has no value for a person who is dead. On this view, courts? refusal to award damages for loss of life is, from a strictly compensatory perspective, correct.
To avoid this odd result, some scholars have suggested that a risk of death is a harm in their view, people should have a claim for tort damages if they are risks of death.75 Others have expressed doubts about whether a risk can be a harm,76 but if this debate is resolved in favor of the risk-is-harm view, then we are back to our earlier claim: it is proper to award damages of R in case of risk imposition. We add only that compensation can take the form of R/q in the case of death at time 3, as well as R for all potential victims at time 1, as long as potential victims purchase insurance and insurance premia adjust.
C. Regulatory Policy
1. Agencies and Deterrence.
With respect to valuing the loss of life, the implications of our deterrence argument is the same for regulatory law as for tort law. In order to provide optimal deterrence of behavior that cause a risk of death, the individual or firm that engages in this behavior should internalize R, so long as we are not concerned with the potentially negligent conduct
As we have seen, tort principles suggest that the people who impose risks on others should either pay R to all affected persons at time 1, or R/q to all actual victims at to the potential victims or the estates or dependents of victims. For deterrence purposes, payments could even go to the government. All that is important
they will have to pay for imposing risks on other people, and will have to pay an amount equal to the victims? willingness to pay to avoid the risk.78 Payment to victims, potential victims, dependents, and estates may provide other kinds of incentives, such as the incentive to bring lawsuits, and these incentives might be valuable, but they should be kept separate at the theoretical level.
Federal regulations do not require firms to pay damages to people who are killed as a result of their behavior. Instead, regulatory agencies direct firms to take precautions
precautions such that the joint costs of precautions and expected losses
minimized. the firm?s activities impose a 1/10,000 risk on 1 million
$500 per person, then the firm is implicitly causing
behavior of the firm and similar firms. In the regulatory that (in theory) are the precautions that the firms would take if they were subject to (optimal) tort liability. If the firms fail to take these precautions, they are fined or punished in some other way. To determine the optimal level of precautions, agencies must perform on their own the calculations that tort law leaves to the potential tortfeasor. Thus, when firms impose risks of death on people, agencies must value those risks, just as in tort law. The analysis is the same as in tort theory. If a firm?s behavior increases the risk of death by q, and people are willing to pay R to avoid that risk, then the firm should be ordered to take are For example, if people, and the cost of incurring the risk is
harm of $500 million. One can conceptualize this equivalently as causing $500 of harm to 1 million people or $5 million of harm to 100 people, those who actually die as a result of the behavior. The regulatory agency uses these figures in a cost-benefit analysis: if these costs are greater than the benefits from the firm?s activities, then the agency will issue regulations that restrict the context, this is in fact the standard theory of valuation of statistical lives79 (what we prefer to call valuation of statistical mortality risks).
Tort law and regulatory law, then, require decisionmakers to attach a value to R, the amount of money a person will pay to avoid a risk of death. But R is not the only loss
that is imposed when a person dies. We have briefly described the general approach to the valuation of R Part III goes into more detail.
2. Coordinating Judicial and Agency Behavior.
According to standard wisdom in law and economics, tort law and regulatory law have redundant functions: both deter cost-unjustified behavior. Reliance on one rather
it. Such an agency would avoid the incentives. If federal agencies acted like the FCDA, compensation would not be necessary via the tort system. And if courts acted like the FCDA, compensating people than the other should depend on their special investigation and enforcement advantages.80 In the regulatory context, a significant disadvantage is that agencies need a great deal of information, on both the cost and the benefit side, to produce optimal regulations. By contrast, damage rules for torts require courts to assess costs alone. If the two systems overlap?if, as is often the case, they govern the same behavior?they may interact in complex ways. If both systems are optimal, and as a result people would take appropriate care if either were in place, the regulatory system will generate unnecessary administrative costs and possibly excessive deterrence. Suppose, for example, that the rules of tort liability and damages imposed the proper incentives if so, there would be no need for regulations, which could introduce distortions. Regulations are necessary largely because many of those who are harmed by private conduct are unlikely to bring suit and to receive compensation. In the context of air pollution, for example, chains of causation are exceedingly difficult to trace, and those who fall prey to life-threatening or fatal diseases are unlikely to know that pollution is responsible. Because of collective action problems and informational deficits, tort law will not provide adequate incentives even if it is optimally tailored.
We can clarify the problem by imagining the existence of a single agency, say the Federal Compensation and Deterrence Agency (FCDA), with the task of ensuring optimal deterrence and of compensating those who deserve redundancy that is a possible outcome of parallel systems of tort law and agency regulation. It would also see compensation as part of the provision of appropriate while creating proper incentives, there would be no need for agency regulations.
So long as the two systems are in place, they should be designed so as to be complementary?a task that has yet to be attempted and that we will not explore here. In the real world, the existence of two systems is likely to be harmless, at least most of the time. People
Even though both tort law and the agencies use valuations that
who take cost-justified precautions avoid fines (from regulatory agencies) and damage payments (from tort victims) people who take suboptimal precautions risk both. In theory, then, people whose behavior is regulated by both systems will not be overdeterred.81 If one system is optimal and the other is suboptimal, however, it is important that the suboptimal system yield to the other regulatory preemption may accomplish this task when regulations impose the proper level of care and when tort liability would distort incentives.
A more interesting difficulty arises when two activities that are partial (or full) substitutes are regulated by different systems that rely on different valuations. Consider, for example, automobile travel, which is mainly but not entirely regulated by the tort system (regulations affect the design of cars and highways, too) and short-haul air travel, which is mainly but not entirely regulated by agencies (tort law also matters, of course). Suppose that agencies and tort law use reasonable but different life valuations. This may distort incentives and cause people to substitute from driving to flying or vice versa. To see why, focus on the valuation of lives of third parties (on the ground victims of air crashes, pedestrians). If tort law values victims less than regulatory law, then?all else equal?driving will be cheaper than flying. So some people who would otherwise prefer to fly will drive instead. are within the reasonable range, it would be better if they both use the same valuation than if they use different valuations, even if one must arbitrarily pick one number from the range.
This point suggests that it would be valuable for the federal government to create an agency or commission that determines focal or recommended valuations, and urges courts to adopt them, taking advantage of the willingness of courts to allow themselves to be influenced by agency judgments in other contexts. Consider, for example, a Federal Loss Valuation Commission, one that would set forth guidelines for determining the value of loss of life, loss of spouse, grief, and so forth, for use by courts in tort cases and by regulatory agencies in their cost-benefit analyses. The guidelines might or might not be purely advisory, but in any event they would tend to bring about a greater uniformity and also stimulate more systematic thinking about valuation of losses. But investigation of this possibility would take us well beyond our central concerns here.
ground that it represents the median in the relevant studies. But there is a risk of arbitrariness in fastening on that median figure, certainly if we lack reason to believe that the relevant study is the most accurate. In fact a more general look at the VSL data produces further puzzles and wider ranges. Some studies find no compensating III. What Is the Value of the Loss of Life?
A. General Issues
We have seen that agency practices grow out of real-world evidence involving labor markets. In principle, this is a reasonable start under the framework we are elaborating. Regulators are attempting to produce the optimal level of deterrence by reference to actual market valuation of statistical risks. Nonetheless, serious questions might be raised about the use of these studies by EPA and other agencies.
1. Uniform Numbers or Variable Numbers
The underlying studies of market behavior show significant variety in the crucial figures, ranging from $0.7 million, in 1997 dollars, to $16.3 million.83 Recently OMB stressed that a ?substantial majority of the resulting estimates of VSL vary from roughly $1 million to $10 million per statistical life.?84 The EPA has adopted the $6.1 million figure on the
differentials at all, indicating a VSL of zero86?implausibly low, to say the least, for purposes of policy. Others find that non-unionized workers receive negative compensating differentials for risk, that is, they appear to be paid less because they face mortality risks.87 Another study finds that African-Americans receive no significant compensating wage differential and hence that their particular VSL is zero.88 On the other hand, it is possible to find studies finding a VSL not below the range in Table 2 but above it consider the finding that for people who choose jobs with low level risks, the VSL is as much as $22 million.89 The most recent meta-study, far more comprehensive than EPA?s own analysis, finds that most studies produce a range of between $3.8 million and $9 million.90 An obvious issue is the grounds for these nontrivial differences.

workers are trading off risks for money, and hence they are essentially useless. This objection cannot be simply dismissed. But current agency practice depends on the judgment that the numerous studies of risk premiums indicate that sufficient numbers of workers are informed to establish a ?price? for additional increments of safety.91 If that judgment is incorrect, then the current numbers need to be rethought, on the labor markets do not show informed tradeoffs between money
theory, the regulators? task would be to use other tools, perhaps contingent valuation studies, to establish those tradeoffs.
3. Worker Coercion
Do workers voluntarily trade risks for dollars? An obvious objection would be that many of the relevant workers have few options, and hence their market behavior? trading off a risk of 1/10,000, say, for an apparently low sum?is in an important sense involuntary.92 If taken as a normative claim about voluntariness, the claim may be right:
When people have few or bad options, their choices might not count as voluntary. But if taken as an objection to VSL studies, the claim is less helpful. Under the theory that we have outlined, the question is how much people are willing to pay to eliminate specified risks. Of course people are willing to pay less, for risk reduction, if they have less to pay. Note also that the VSL numbers for workers are not radically different from the corresponding numbers generated by purchases of cars, housing, and so forth93?a fact that weakens the suggestion that coercion lies behind the employment figures.
In any case government does workers no favors by requiring them to ?buy? more health protection than they want. Suppose, for example, that workers are generally willing to accept $600 to run a risk of 1/10,000. If an agency bans that deal, and forbids

a specific example of the general proposition that when people?s circumstances lead them to make harsh deals, they are usually not helped when government blocks those deals. Of course the analysis would be different when those who receive the benefits of regulation do not also pay for it.94
4. Uniformity and Individuation
Agency regulations use a single value for a statistical life, but a moment?s reflection should be enough to show that by the very theory that agencies now use, this is a blunder.95 There are several problems here.
First, people will almost certainly show a large difference in the dollar value of statistically identical mortality risks.96 Would 1/100,000 risks of deaths from lung
disease? An affirmative answer would be extremely surprising, and a great deal of evidence suggests otherwise. The American economy contains a wide range of occupations and industries, and a uniform VSL should not be expected to emerge from
each of them. Indeed, a recent study finds significant differences across both occupations and industries,97 with blue collar workers showing a higher VSL than others.98
It is inevitable that a wide range of values would emerge from studies that looked separately at machine operators, executive positions, sales, dental technicians, equipment cleaners, security guards, and secretaries99?and undoubtedly diverse values could be found within each category. In addition, many risks controlled by the EPA are qualitatively different from the workplace risks that EPA has used to generate its VSL. There
they are risk-averse or risk-inclined, and
wealth and income. Continuing national income

is considerable evidence that the risks associated with cancer produce a higher WTP than other kinds of risk.100 For example, Hammit and Liu find that in Taiwan, willingness to pay to eliminate a cancer risk is about one-third larger than WTP to avoid a risk of a similar, chronic degenerative disease.101 The ?cancer premium? might be produced by the ?dread? nature of cancer it seems well-established that dreaded risks produce special social concern, holding the statistical risk constant.102
Second, both individuals and groups should be expected to show significant differences in their VSL. This is partly because partly because of differences in terms of both
growth means that studies from the 1970s, on which agencies now rely, understate VSL. Equally important, risk reduction programs that are aimed at wealthy populations should, under the prevailing theory,
aimed at poor populations. Those who have a great deal of resources will naturally show a higher VSL than those with little. According to the theory that now
animates regulatory practice, agencies should use a VSL that corresponds to the actual number for the population at stake.
This point has numerous implications. The workplace studies on which agencies currently rely involve people with income that is below the population-wide median to that extent, the numbers are too low as applied to a population that is more representative of the nation as a whole. Agency distinctions between wealthy and poor populations would undoubtedly be quite controversial, but they are required by the very theory that agencies currently use. Less controversially, recent evidence suggests that older people show a lower VSL than younger people,104 and that distinction might well be incorporated into regulatory policy.
The general conclusion is that use of WTP has a plausible logic to it, that variable numbers make far more sense than uniform ones, and that the real question involve information and administrability. Regulatory programs often affect thousands or even millions

Second, the dependents are deprived of
of people at the same time, and full individuation is therefore impossible. A rule that calls for minimum levels of air quality cannot provide air quality that is perfectly calibrated to each person?s WTP. Nonetheless, agencies could certainly move in the direction of greater individuation. So long as the WTP figures are accurate, government does well to begin with them. Exactly the same is true for courts in wrongful death actions.
B. Dependents
Tort law generally awards dependents the portion of the victim?s future income that would have supported those dependents if the victim had lived a normal life, plus sometimes an usually ignores the loss to dependents.106 What is the proper treatment?
An act that kills a breadwinner harms dependents in two ways. First, the
distress. dependants feel grief or emotional support?a of course, that people?s WTP incorporates both of these harms?that when a worker, for example, is WTP $60 to eliminate a risk of

as well as aware of the universe of losses, and we believe that it would be heroic to assume that the WTP figures fully incorporate those losses. The extent to which they do so is an empirical question on which information is absent. Grief and lost income raise quite different issues, and so we discuss them separately.
1. Grief
When a person dies, his dependents such as his spouse and children are likely to feel grief. Grief is a welfare loss, and potential tortfeasors should take this loss into account as well as more conventional nondependents as well, including friends and adult children, and grief felt by these people are welfare losses as well, we will confine our attention to dependents, for whom the emotional distress is likely to be particularly acute.
One reason for excluding grief is the difficulty of monetizing it. How can the WTP for grief be determined? The very question might seem absurd. Although it is easy to imagine contingent value questions that ask, ?How much are you willing to pay today so that you would not feel grief if a loved one died at some time in the future??, we suspect that people would have difficulty answering this question. Even though people see grief that they ought to feel exceptionally difficult or even impossible to monetize the value of not feeling grief. Other contingent valuation questions seem more promising. For example, people might be asked, ?How much are you willing to pay to avoid having your spouse be subjected to a risk of 1/50,000?? This question, whose answer should incorporate anticipated not fundamentally different from others that are taken seriously in the context of regulatory policy.107 But contingent valuation studies generally face serious questions of
reliability,108 and the valuation of risks faced by loved ones faces those questions in unusually acute form.
A better approach might be to find proxies. Consider, for example, the problem of valuing the grief felt from the death of a spouse. Studies show that married people are happier than unmarried people, and that part of this happiness is in part a result of emotional closeness and companionship.109 Although the work is not at an advanced
difference between the happiness of a married person and a widowed
(1) and (2). stage, it suggests that the
person can be quantified using simple scales based on subjective assessments of one?s emotional well-being.110 To derive a WTP to avoid grief from a spouse?s death, one would need to (1) determine the average length of time that the grief persists (for example, until remarriage) (2) find an equivalent happiness difference in an area of life that has been reliably monetized (for example, WTP to avoid disease or depression), and convert this difference into annual units (3) multiply
A very crude estimate can be made from a recent study. This study shows that a person who is married has the level of self-reported happiness equivalent to that felt by a widowed person who receives an extra $100,000 per year (in 1990 dollars) but is otherwise equivalent.111 If the average number of years before remarriage or the ?natural? termination of the original marriage (from divorce, or normal mortality) is, say, 5 years, then the welfare loss is equivalent to about $500,000 (or closer to $400,000 with discounting). We emphasize that this figure is meant for illustrative purposes, both because the methodology is different from the standard VSL methodology and because the methodology is very new and at an early stage of testing and development. In addition, the study does not quite capture grief if it captures anything, it is the monetary
equivalent of the welfare reduction from not having a spouse (a number that may be larger or smaller than grief because of the wrongful death of a spouse). Still, the study shows

that the amounts under consideration are not trivial, and indeed will be much higher when the decedent has multiple dependents?children as well as a spouse.
Whatever the flaws of this method, it is likely to be superior to the current alternatives. Regulatory law implicitly treats this WTP as equal to zero, which cannot be right. Tort law leaves this question to the jury, which, without any guidance, is likely to produce amounts that are unreliable, unpredictable, or both. Jurors must engage in a difficult enterprise of translating grief into monetary equivalents and in any case rely on their lay judgments, which studies suggest are systematically incorrect. For example, people tend to think that victims of traumas never fully recover their sense of well-being, when in fact the grief or mental distress that results form such traumas usually dissipates after a few years.112 We conclude that some amount for grief should
and regulatory assessments of the loss associated with mortality risks. Any particular number has a degree of arbitrariness, but on the basis of current evidence, $500,000 would not be the worst place to start.
2. Lost Support
When a person dies, dependents are deprived of the portion of the victim?s income and resources that were used for their benefit. It is tempting to think that the monetized welfare loss?the dependent?s WTP to avoid loss of support?is equivalent to the lost support, but this is not likely to be true.
To see why, imagine a two person household consisting of H and W. W is the breadwinner, and H takes care of the house. W makes $50,000 per year. Suddenly, W is
The answer is not $50,000 per year (that is, a lump sum of something like $1 million). It is quite possible that many people in the position of H will now get a job that earns, say, $30,000 per year. Most Hs are not likely to be better off than they were before from a purely financial perspective, but it would be wrong to say that they are $50,000 w orse off. The new one-person household receives only $20,000 less per
does not share his income with W. H must work now, and perhaps he must pay someone to clean the house, but he also does not have to perform household services that partly benefit W, as he did before W?s death.
Even if H cannot work (suppose he is disabled), the right answer is probably not $50,000.
is appropriate for judgments
number could possibly make sense. For regulators, dealing
For one thing, W may devote only a small portion of her income to the support of H. Perhaps she spends $40,000 for herself, and only $10,000 for him. On the other side, W may invest significant uncompensated work into supporting H: for example, she cooks for him. The former consideration suggests that $50,000 is too high, the latter consideration that $50,000 is too low.
We can even imagine extreme situations, where the dependent is made better off (financially) by the breadwinner?s death. Suppose that a parent neglects his children, and gives them inadequate food and clothing. The parent dies and the children are moved to the home of relatives or to a foster home, where they receive adequate food and clothing. From the perspective of financial support (but not necessarily emotional well being), the children are better off, not worse off the loss of support caused by the death is zero. These examples suggest that a high degree of individuation about loss of support no uniform
with populations rather than individuals, it would be necessary to assess the population-wide mean for the relevant beneficiaries.
How should loss of support be calculated? Consider first the death of a spouse in a family that has no children. As a matter of theory, a sensible approach would be to determine the economies of scale from household production.113 Consider two people who have separate households let their annual joint costs be C. Now the two people set up a single household their annual joint costs drop to C? because one kitchen is cheaper than two, and so forth. As a first approximation, ½(C–C’) would be the annual (financial) cost to one person from the death of the other. If on average, it takes a person X years to set up a new household after the death of a spouse, then the financial cost is ½X(C–C’).
This figure can be derived from existing studies that look at the financial cost of divorce.114
When children exist, the calculations are more complex. If one of two parents
will incur extra expenses, for which they ought to
compensated,
the subjects? expectation of lost support dies, then the children are deprived of the victim?s investment in childcare. This amount can be roughly monetized by using market data for the cost of nannies and the like. If a single parent dies, or both parents die, the children must be moved to a new family. Foster parents receive a subsidy from the state this is a first approximation of the financial burden, and ought to be borne by the tortfeasor or regulated entity. Friends or relatives who take the children in also be except limited by any economies of scale (a third child will probably require less financial support at the margin than a first or second child).
Tort law sometimes attempts to handle these complex problems, but imperfectly. In the jurisdictions with the most sophisticated rules, the courts award only a portion of the decedent?s lost income to the dependents, after subtracting expenses and the future consumption of the decedent. The September 11th Compensation Fund also takes this approach. As we have noted, lost income is not likely to be the same as the monetized welfare loss.
Regulatory policy entirely ignores lost support. This would not be a wholly indefensible approach if WTP studies implicitly incorporated
for their dependents in case of death.115 A worker who demands a risk premium for hazardous work might do so in part so that he can purchase extra insurance for his dependents. The WTP figure, then, reflects not only the worker?s hedonic loss of life, but the worker?s welfare loss from expected lost support for dependents.116 The problem is that the WTP will not fully reflect the lost support if the breadwinner is not fully altruistic (and full altruism is rare) or if he does not think carefully about the needs of his dependents in the case of his death. We think that the approach we outlined above makes more sense. The adjustment, for the regulatory context, comes from the fact that
regulations necessarily protects large numbers of people, and hence estimates for the relevant population are inevitable. What is hard to defend is the complete exclusion of lost support
household three
from current regulatory practice.
How much should regulatory agencies value the loss to dependents? Our argument above suggests that the value should be the lost household economies of scale until a new two-person household can be created. For two-person households, this is the extra cost (or lower benefits) that result when a person moves from a two-person household to a one-person household.
As an illustration, imagine that the two-person household has a joint income of $50,000 both before and after separation, but that living costs increase by $5,000 for each person and that, on average, each person could form a new two-person years after the termination of the old one. Now suppose instead that one person dies the loss of support for the other person is $5,000 per year for three years, her extra expense.117 Although we have not tried to determine the actual amount, given current levels of income, household economies, and so forth, we suspect that the right amount will be in the thousands or perhaps tens of thousands of dollars per death.
C. Children
Because of its traditional focus on loss of income, tort law ought to produce low numbers for the loss of a child?s life. Children lack dependents therefore, tortfeasors who kill children are not required to pay damages on account of loss of support in loss-todependents states. Whether the actual awards are lower for children than for adults is a hard question, given the discretion of the jury, and we do not have a full answer, though existing data provide some clues.118 By contrast, regulatory policy treats the life of a child
and the life an adult as equivalent, although if agencies used VSLYs, a child?s life would be valued at a higher amount because the child has a longer life expectancy.119 What is the proper treatment?

1. Parental Judgments
One possibility is to rely on parental judgments. A recent study attempts to determine the VSL of children by examining the market for bicycle safety helmets for children. Bicycle safety helmets reduce the probability of death by about 4/1,000,000 per year for children between the ages of
10-14. In 1997, the annualized cost of a helmet was about $6.51. The authors found that, given market data on the willingness of parents to buy helmets, the median parent implicitly attributed a VSL of $2.7 million for children between 5 and 9, and $2.6 million for children between 10 and 14 by contrast, the VSL for the adults who bought helmets for themselves was $4.0 million (1997 dollars).120
The problem with the study is that it does not even purport to show how much children are willing to pay to reduce the risk of death it shows what adults are willing to pay to reduce the risk of death to their children. The parent?s WTP for avoiding death s not a good altruists and are willing to trade off their children?s risk of death against other things such
as their own utility from consumption.121 If we wanted to find out how children value mortality risks, we would need to look at the children?s own attitudes and behavior but children do not usually have income, rarely make their own decisions about purchasing
about risks. For these reasons, a study that attempted
the advantage of not being from the figures of an adult who has that child?s future income.123 In the latter two cases, safety equipment, and have poor judgment
to tease out children?s WTP to avoid risks would tell us little or nothing about the welfare loss from a child?s death. If a ten-year-old child is willing to pay $1 to avoid a risk of 1/10,000, we would know nothing about how tort law and regulatory policy should value his death.
2. Children and welfare
What should be done? The touchstone is welfare loss, and a child loses welfare as a result of death. Thus, we should assign some WTP for a child?s death. Some arbitrariness cannot be avoided, but one possibility is to follow current practice and to use the standard, uniform VSL used for adults. This approach has clearly inferior to the alternatives. Another approach would be to take the VSLY for adults, and multiply it by the expected number of years of life. This approach is consistent with the general interest, in many circles, in focusing on statistical life-years as well as or in addition to statistical lives.122 Yet another possibility would be to estimate a child victim?s future income, and then determine his VSL or his VSLYs by extrapolating children would have higher valuations of life than adults do, which appears intuitively correct.124 We think that the second approach seems the most reasonable, but there is no simple way to establish its superiority.
3. Offsetting parental behavior
A conclusion in favor of any one of the three approaches must be qualified, however. The risks faced by children are, to a considerable extent, controlled by their
parents, and one must be careful that regulatory policy and parental autonomy do not clash, leading to perverse results. In a sense, this problem is not unique to the context of valuing children?s lives. Offsetting behavior can occur in many contexts.125 But the mechanisms here have distinctive features.
To see the problem, consider a simple case where the household that benefits from a regulation also incurs its full costs. Suppose that Parent (P) is willing to pay $20 to avoid a 1/100,000 risk of death for his child (C). An agency issues a regulation that forces P to pay, say, $50 to avoid this risk by buying safety helmets, car seats, or some other child safety pay $50 to reduce this risk in order to avoid a legal sanction,
seem implausible to some readers.
appropriate valuation of mortality risks faced by would be to multiply VSLY by the number of remaining life-years, with a lower amount
device. Although P must now
P retains the discretion to spend less money on C. If P can save money by reducing safety along some other margin, one not regulated by the agency, P will do so. For example, perhaps P will stop sending C to school on the (safe but expensive) bus and put him in a (cheap but riskier) car pool. And even if P cannot do this, P might spend less money on C in other ways: for example, purchasing fewer toys or clothes or food. Under the stated assumptions, both P?s and C?s welfare will decline as a result of the regulation.126
These problems do not show that children?s VSL should always be treated as lower than that of adults, but they point out some difficulties with the contrary view.127 The proper degree of adjustment is an empirical question on which information is absent. If parents adjust in the manner described, then it would be incorrect to base a child?s VSL on the VSLYs of adults. On the other hand, we do not know whether or to what extent parents adjust in this way, and it might
We do not have a simple conclusion about
children. Certainly tort law errs by excluding the child?s hedonic loss and including only the distress felt by parents. For regulators, perhaps the best approach (perhaps in the range of the parental valuation of $2 to $3 million) used for regulations
for which parents are expected to adjust (perhaps child safety seats). Tort law should award an amount within this range for the hedonic loss to the child from his death.
D. Loss to Society
Commentators sometimes argue that tort law undervalues the loss of life because

It seems clear that if an accurate it ignores the cost to ?society.?128 Most people produce value that they do not fully consume or give to dependents this value benefits strangers in the larger society. Workers produce goods that consumers value more than the price that they pay entrepreneurs start new businesses that employ people people give to charity inventors invent products whose value is greater than what the inventors can capture through patent law the same is true of authors of books and the protections of copyright law there are countless Good Samaritan acts and many people devote their lives to public service. When these people die, isn?t there a loss to society beyond the loss to the person who dies and his immediate family and friends? Perhaps oddly, neither tort nor regulatory law counts these losses. Here as elsewhere, there are obvious difficulties of monetization, but the failure to assign any value at all is puzzling.
One response markets are vast, and the cost of replacing a worker who dies will generally be trivial. (Recall that we are speaking here of losses of society losses to the worker and dependents are assessed independently.) In addition, many people do bad things as well as good things, and presumably the hostile and aggressive acts must be subtracted from the Good Samaritan acts. Finally, to the extent that the size of the population is a concern for economic growth or national security purposes, the government has many disposal for adjusting it. Temporary visas can be issued for foreign workers immigration can be increased and other barriers against migration can be reduced or eliminated. And birth control policies can be adjusted to increase or decrease population as necessary.
Still, serious thought should be given to monetizing the loss to society when a person dies. Assume again that the legal system had a social hedometer, one that could measure that loss and turn it into m

If the relevant amounts are likely to be low, current practice might be justified but a great deal of additional work needs to be done on this topic.
E. Foreigners
Many wrongful acts kill people who are not citizens of the United States. Some of these people reside in the United States, either legally or illegally (?alien residents,? for our purposes) others live outside the United States (?alien nonresidents?). Some of these wrongful acts are committed by Americans or firms predominantly run or owned by Americans others are committed by aliens or foreigners. All of these acts are potentially governed by American tort and regulatory law.
Let us consider two examples, one from regulation. In Filartiga v. Pena-Irala, a case involving the torture and murder of a Paraguayan citizen by a Paraguayan police official, the plaintiffs, who were the brother and father of the victim, brought a claim in an American court under the Alien Tort Statute, and obtained damages of more than $10 million.130 A magistrate had initially awarded them $375,000 in compensatory damages for emotional distress, funeral and medical expenses, and so forth the district court also awarded punitive damages of over $9 million. The court claimed to base the compensatory awards mainly on the domestic law of the countries in which the torts took place. If so, the compensatory damages were probably low for the same reason that they are low in the U.S.: domestic law in foreign countries does not award damages for hedonic loss, but only for lost income and like.131 However, as a result of the punitive award the damages were far in excess of what
would have been available under Paraguayan law, because punitive damages are not awarded in wrongful death cases in Paraguay.132
Many toxic substances produced in the United States contaminate territory outside American borders. Chemicals such as PCBs migrate across borders through atmospheric processes, and may be ingested by people living far away. Most of the EPA?s regulatory work involves purely domestic statutes, and the EPA refuses to count foreign lives when evaluating regulations based on those statutes, even when the substance being regulated
environments.133 If it is proper to count the lives of
to foreign law in case of torts committed crosses borders and harms foreign foreigners, then the cost-benefit analyses that EPA has relied on undervalue the benefits of regulations.
These examples reflect an international version of the domestic tension between tort and regulatory law. Because tort law in other countries, like in the U.S., is mainly limited to compensating dependents, foreign tort awards usually undervalue the victim?s loss. Because American courts generally defer on foreign soil, the low tort awards in other countries are implicitly incorporated into American foreign policy, and, in particular, American VSLs for foreign lives. By contrast, American regulatory policy generally ignores foreigners. Which approach is correct?
Our argument so far has been that the VSL should reflect people?s willingness to pay to avoid risks. Because the willingness to pay to avoid risks increases with income, poorer people have lower VSLs than wealthier people.134 Because many aliens are substantially poorer than Americans, they will have very low VSLs.135 Reflecting crossnational wealth differences, VSL is highly variable across nations.136 Studies find a VSL as low as $200,000 for Taiwan, $500,000 for South Korea, and $1.2 million for India?
but $21.7 million for Canada and $19 million for Australia.137 Consider the following table138:
Table 4: VSL Across Nations
In addition, some aliens may have lower VSLs than Americans because of cultural and social differences. For example, if people in a foreign culture do not fear death as much as Americans do, they will have lower VSLs, all else equal. The conclusion that aliens should have lower VSLs follows from the argument that VSLs should reflect social costs. risk, but results in a reduction in pay of $30. Unless the willingness to pay figure is a product of ignorance or some failure of rationality,140 the regulation harms rather benefits the workers.
This view might seem offensive, but certainly as a general rule, it is more consistent with the well-being of aliens than the contrary view is. First, consider the case where a particular alien in a foreign country both enjoys the benefit and bears the cost of a regulation or tort rule. For example, a labor regulation requires foreign suppliers of goods for the American market to provide safety devices to workers. The workers are willing to pay $20 to avoid a 1/100,000 risk of death the safety device eliminates that
Second, consider the case where one nonresident alien enjoys the benefit of the regulation, and another alien (living in the same country) bears the cost. A regulation requires factories to reduce levels of emissions: neighbors would be willing to pay $100 to reduce the risk of death created consumers bear a cost of $200 from higher prices. If the neighbors and equal wealth, the regulation simply wealth from one group to another: it does not increase welfare but reduces welfare. If the neighbors then the regulation might but what justifies benefit, not the use of inflated VSLs. If the U.S. wants to effect a redistribution of wealth between groups in other countries, use regulatory so, there is no reason to limit these rules to cases of death they could be used for nonfatal harms as well. And the use of inflated SLs would only obscure the nature of the regulatory intervention.
In any case it would normally make

A further question is this: Even assuming that the redistribution would be in the right direction, why would the U.S. want to redistribute wealth in other countries through regulatory and tort law? One problem is that, unless the U.S. seizes control of the government of the foreign country, the government will be able to undo the American redistribution by using tax and other instruments. more for redistributions of wealth, rather than unilaterally intervening. Finally, if unilateral intervention is to occur, the courts (in the case of tort law) would seem to be a poor vehicle better to rely on the state department and other executive branch agencies. That the U.S. has rarely concerned itself with the distribution of wealth in other countries?focusing instead on trade, security, and human rights?suggests that indirect redistribution through tort and regulatory law would not be politically sustainable.
Third, consider the case where nonresident aliens enjoy the benefit of the regulation, and American emissions that damage prices, while benefiting mainly versions of this regulation: the first (low pollution control) is based on a cost-benefit analysis that values foreign lives lower than American lives. The second (high pollution
control) is based on a cost-benefit analysis that values foreign lives and American lives equally, at the American level. Under the stated assumptions, the second redistributes resources from Americans to people living in other countries. Which regulation is superior?
In the abstract, the answer is hardly clear, and the question cannot be sensibly approached without consideration of American foreign policy toward the nations that benefit from the regulation. Let us consider the relation between the U.S. and, say, India. The two states can gain a lot from each other by cooperating, but there is also a danger of conflict. To simplify, suppose that the U.S. wants three things from India: security cooperation (such as flyover rights) an open market for U.S. goods and an improvement in the treatment of religious minorities. India seeks from the U.S. similar things: diplomatic assistance with its ongoing disputes with Pakistan an open market for Indian goods and an improvement of American treatment of Indian residents. Suppose that at a
will retaliate. The new equilibrium could involve a lower hypothetical stage 1, India and the U.S. achieve a balance between their aims: each gives a little of what the other wants.
Now at stage 2, an American regulatory agency issues an environmental regulation that happens to benefit India considerably, and at great cost to American citizens. At this point, the American diplomatic authorities might argue that because the U.S. is conferring a new benefit on India (say, less flooding of coastal areas), India should respond by conferring a new benefit on the U.S. (say, more trade). India could respond by saying thanks for reducing coastal flooding?that is important?but it is not more important to us than preserving our domestic X industry. In short, the new regulation disturbs the cooperative equilibrium between the U.S. and India: the U.S., perceiving itself as giving more than it is getting, will (in theory) respond by withdrawing some other benefits, and India level of cooperation?one in which the U.S. gives India something of little value to India and so gets something of little value in return?unless the U.S. government can change the regulation in a way that benefits India less.141
Our point is that under certain circumstances, regulations and tort rules that are based on inflated foreign VSLs will redistribute wealth from Americans to foreign
governments. Such transfers would not be wildly popular in the abstract, at least among Americans. They may nonetheless be desirable for reasons of foreign policy or social justice, but they should be recognized as such the use of the inflated VSL conceals the magnitude of the transfer and even its nature. Further, transfers?whether disguised through inflated VSLs or undisguised?should cohere with foreign policy otherwise, they will lead to perverse results or be ineffective. The simple conclusion is that in many imaginable circumstances, a high VSL, for people in other countries, will produce perverse redistribution or redistribution for which there is no strong claim?and that even when the redistribution through a high VSL seems desirable (because it benefits poor people on balance), there are many questions about whether regulatory agencies should adopt it. It follows that as a general rule, both agencies and courts should use a VSL that attempts to match the figure in the relevant nation.
IV. Proposals for Reform
A. Use of VSL in Regulations
Tort law offers two principal lessons for regulatory policy. The first involves the need for a greater degree of individuation. The second involves the need to pay attention to the interests of dependents. A properly designed system of valuation would move substantially in both directions.
1. Individuation
We have seen that under the theory that agencies now use, VSL is calculated on the basis of people?s willingness to pay. That very theory raises serious doubts about the government?s use of a uniform number. The appropriate value varies across both risks and persons. If, for example, the risk is accompanied by a high degree of pain and suffering, it deserves more attention than if it is not?a conclusion that is supported by studies finding a kind of ?premium? for bad deaths.142 Agencies should therefore provide a higher VSL for cancer risks than for other risks, a possibility that EPA has recognized
in its ?sensitivity analysis? for arsenic.143 A great deal more should be done in this vein.144 As tort law demonstrates, a uniform number is extremely difficult to defend.
Variations across persons are important as well. To be sure, it is impractical to think that regulators should fully individuate risks across persons, in part because regulations often affect many people at once. But less fine-grained distinctions are possible. For example, people over sixty tend to show a lower VSL than people between thirty and forty.145 Regulators might build on these figures to generate different numbers for programs protecting people at different points along the age spectrum. Putting the difficult case of children to one side, agency rules should have a lower value when the benefited class consists largely of elderly people. A movement in this direction would have significant consequences for valuation it would drive down the monetized benefits of a number of programs delivering health gains largely to senior citizens.
Additional distinctions are possible. If a program would benefit largely wealthy
an unusually high VSL?a point that would support a higher
for irlines (the exact opposite, not incidentally, of current
to this approach is that in some circumstances, a high VSL, for to the poor, simply because they receive benefits for which people, regulators might use VSL safety decisions involving a
practice, which involves an unusually low number for airline safety146). More controversially, programs protecting the poor might be given a lower VSL, in a way that tracks the approach of tort law, at least where those who benefit from regulation are also paying for it. A possible objection
the poor, might be beneficial
they pay only a fragment. We do not resolve the obvious empirical and ethical complexities here.147 We note simply that a higher degree of individuation would be desirable, that in most cases it would raise no serious ethical problems, and that tort law shows that a movement toward greater individuation is both feasible and consistent with longstanding practices and intuitions.
2. Dependents. For regulatory policy, the most obvious gap is that agency numbers do not recognize the fact that a death causes welfare losses to many people other than the victim. If a worker is killed as a result of carcinogens in the workplace, others will almost always be affected. Agency failure to take account of the welfare losses results in numbers that are far too low.
conventional assessment
less ambiguous than it now is, well-organized groups would undoubtedly engage in special pleading, attempting to move agency practices in their preferred directions. A uniform number helps to insulate agencies from the relevant pressures. In the context of tort suits, individuation does not face those
for insulation. In principle, however,
We have suggested the importance of distinguishing between two sets of losses: grief on the one hand and lost income on the other. Following tort law, full individuation would take account of the fact that the size of those losses very much depends on the particular situation. Other things being equal, the loss of a parent with six young children causes more serious harm than the loss of someone without dependents. If our earlier calculations are correct, several million dollars would be added to the
of the benefits of a regulation that saved that parent?s statistical life. A serious difficulty here is that agency regulations protect broad classes of people and hence it is quite impractical to think that agencies should make fully individual judgments about the welfare losses. But it is not impractical to think that agencies should adjust their numbers in a way that ensures that serious welfare losses are not ignored. As in the case of statistical risks, contingent valuation studies and market evidence might be consulted to generate appropriate numbers for grief. We have offered some suggestions about how this might be done. For regulations, individual assessments are of course impossible, but a positive number is better than no number, and population-wide means would be a sensible place to start.
In the regulatory context, there is a cautionary note. Any effort at individuation would have a high degree of political salience and would undoubtedly mobilize affected interests. Even if the social science were pressures, and hence there is little need individuation is clearly desirable, and it seems quite pessimistic to think that the effort to
produce greater accuracy should be rejected because of the possible effects of interestFor deterrence purposes, the tortfeasor should pay the amount that the victim would

B. Use of VSL in Tort Law
In wrongful death actions, damages should be calculated in the following way.
1. The Hedonic Loss of the Victim
be willing to pay to avoid the risk that was imposed on him by the tortfeasor?s class of actions, divided by that risk (R/q). Damages should not be based on lost income as in the regulatory context, lost income is at best a proxy for the victim?s loss. Deterrence can be satisfied through payment to the government, but if it is paid to the estate or dependents, then indirect compensation is also achieved.
The amount can be calculated in two ways. First, the VSL (or VSLY) used by agencies could be used, with any adjustments as necessary to reflect individual factors: the defendant?s risk preference, life expectancy (if VSLY is used), wealth, quality of life, and so forth. Indeed, it is possible that the victim?s own wages will reflect his VSL, if he has a risky job. So long as agencies use a uniform figure, courts might start with the standard $6 million figure, and then make adjustments as appropriate. If agencies used more refined figures, as we have argued that they should, then courts might begin with those figures instead, and make appropriate adjustments from that amount. Second, the jury could be asked to determine the hedonic loss. However, the proper jury question is not ?what is the value of the life?s pleasures lost by the victim?? This question is too abstract. A better question would have paid to avoid the risk in question.? Of course an abstract answer to that question would be unreliable VSL studies should be used to educate juries about common valuations, so that their own estimates will be informed rather than arbitrary.149
To ensure consistent and rational awards, we would strongly prefer the first approach, on the ground that juries are not well-equipped to answer these questions but if a strong role
second would also work so long as the jury?s
on tort awards, especially for the
the time) a hedonic loss state. for the jury is deemed important, the judgments are disciplined by expert witnesses and the court.
This reform would have a significant impact elderly in non-hedonic loss states. We can already see the logic of our argument at work in some of the hedonic loss states. Consider Thomas v. Hilburn,150 in which the jury awarded wrongful death damages of $300,000 to the son of the 75 year old victim. On appeal, the defendant argued that damages should be reduced to $66,311 for lost income, plus a few thousand dollars more for medical expenses, funeral expenses, and property damage. The court rejected the argument because Mississippi was (at
Although our approach would have suggested a verdict of a few million or so, depending on the wealth and other characteristics of the victim, the court clearly recognized the key point that the hedonic loss of an elderly man is much higher than his lost income.151
In the tort context, there is an additional complication. Valuation of statistical risks has occurred for risks of specified magnitudes, usually ranging from 1/10,000 to 1/100,000.152 Insofar as tort law is dealing with risks in this range, use of agency figures is fully appropriate. But it should be clear that these numbers need not be taken to support a VSL that is independent of probability.153 Suppose that people would be willing to pay $60 to eliminate a risk of 1/100,000. From this it does not follow that people would be willing to pay $6000 to eliminate a risk of 1/1000, or $60,000 to eliminate a risk of 1/100,
or $600,000 to eliminate a risk of 1/10. It is plausible to believe that people?s WTP to reduce statistical risks is nonlinear.154 As the probability approaches 100%, people become willing to pay an amount for risk reduction that rises nonlinearly to 100% of their income, and?at some point?become unwilling to accept any amount in return for giving
negligence, a similar floor is appropriate, supplemented perhaps by punitive
up their entitlement to life.155 From this it follows that if a defendant imposes risks that are far higher than those with which agencies deal, the agency figures are too low, and hence the tort system should use significantly higher ones.
The sheer variety of wrongful death actions, in terms of both probability and kind of death, severely complicates the inquiry into appropriate damage awards. Insofar as the tort system is dealing with probabilities in the general range with which agencies deal, it can build on (appropriately reformed) agency practice. Insofar as the tort system is dealing with the most egregious conduct?homicide, for example?the regulatory analysis of WTP does not apply directly, but a standard amount of (say) $6 million at least provides an appropriate floor. Insofar as the conduct imposes high probability risks, as through gross
damages. These suggestions are in line with our general emphasis on the fact that all mortality risks are not the same. What cannot be defended is the total exclusion of hedonic damages in wrongful death actions.
2. Harm to Survivors As we have seen, calculating the loss to survivors is difficult in practice, but conceptually straightforward. For deterrence purposes, survivors should recover for their welfare loss?this means grief, mental distress, loss of companionship, and the like. It is less clear what dependents should recover in terms of lost support (such as lost income attributable to their care). The conceptually proper recovery is the amount of money that would make the survivor just as well off (financially) as he would have been if the death had not
tort damages currently should be (and apparently are) low even in jurisdictions that include lost income, given that their earning years are almost over. By contrast, under our approach their damages are likely to be, again, in the $6 million or higher range.156 For adults with dependents, we suspect that an
occurred, which will usually be tied to the loss of household economies of scale and the breadwinner?s degree of altruism. This amount may be higher than lost income (if the victim does a lot of work for the household that is not compensated in the market). And it may be lower (if the survivor can easily get a job and the victim was never very generous in the first place).
If our approach were adopted, tort damages would rise, especially for children and the elderly. As we have seen, damages for wrongful death are currently under about $3 million, based on lost income, mental distress, and the like. Under our system, they are likely to be as much as $6 million or higher for the average person. As for children, tort damages currently should be low in jurisdictions that exclude lost income (though it is not clear that this is the case) and for the elderly, additional several hundred thousands of dollars per dependent would be added to the $6 million baseline.
Our comparison of tort law and regulatory policy raises an obvious positive question. Why do these two areas of law take such different approaches to valuing lives? The beginning of an answer to this question is that even though the two areas of law have an overlapping purpose?the deterrence of harmful conduct?they also have radically different historical origins and orientations: tort law is ex post and individualized, while regulatory law is ex ante and generalized. As a result, tort law is naturally more particularistic and less rule-bound. The ex ante focus of regulation pushes administrators away from case-specific standards and in the direction of rule-bound judgments. But this point raises many complexities.
A. In General
Tort law?s ex post and individualistic orientation has several consequences. First, the implicit (or explicit) valuation of human lives in the tort context is information-rich. Courts have access to a great deal of evidence about the particular parties and circumstances. Under the rules of evidence, all relevant evidence may be introduced to the court, and both plaintiff and defendant have strong incentives to take advantage of these rules. Given that the victim is a real, identifiable person, it is natural for the court to determine the actual loss, including losses to dependents, rather than to rely on statistical averages. In fact there is no need to rely on such averages, which provides less accurate information than the facts themselves.
Second, tort remedies direct the decisionmaker to compare the victim?s post-tort state with her pre-tort state, and to ignore the rest of society. This approach works well
when the tort causes a financial loss or a physical injury, but when it kills the
the decisionmaker has no way to compare post-tort and pre-tort well-being in a
that can be reliably monetized. To determine the hedonic loss from death, one cannot look at the actual victim?s experience of death one can rely only on statistical inference enough victim, way based on generalization from the rest of society. But in view of judicial traditions, this would be unfamiliar and even odd in the tort setting.
Third, and following from the first two points, tort damages tend to be highly variable. Juries lack reference points, so their judgments will depend heavily on the
V. Positive Questions
presentation of evidence by lawyers, and on whatever anchors,158 prejudices, and citizens bring to the jury box. Juries might also react emotionally to the case, misunderstand
ex post nature of litigation and the fact that awards are issued
so that averages can be used. Thus, if a regulation expectations or jury instructions, and allow irrelevant factors (like a desire for revenge) to influence their determination of the award.
Fourth, tort law has low public visibility, at least at the system-wide level. Individual awards may receive considerable public attention, but the system of awards? the median award, the mean award, the variance?does not.159 Hence public scrutiny is relatively weak unless and until a salient network of awards (as in the case of the September 11 fund) is announced. The difficulties of monetization, the variable figures, and the possible arbitrariness of many outcomes attract little in the way of scrutiny and review, not least because of the
one at a time.
Compare regulatory law. Regulatory decisions are ex ante and highly abstract. The victims of the regulated conduct are not identified, and so their personal characteristics do not stand out (although sometimes a disaster or crisis may provoke the regulation160). Whereas court cases are emotionally rich, regulatory decisions often (though not always) seem dry and technical, even though usually much more is at stake.
The ex ante and general orientation of regulatory policy has several consequences. First, because one cannot identify the actual people benefited by a regulation, one must rely on averages. The usual notion is that although all individuals are different, differences will balance each other out, protects people of type X with a VSL of $7 million and people of type Y with a VSL of $5 million, regulators use the average valuation of $6 million for a regulation that affects people evenly divided into the two types.
This reasoning is not implausible, and sometimes averages are appropriate despite their crudeness but they can lead regulators astray. Some regulations affect only persons of type X, and other regulations affect only persons of type Y then different valuations should be used. Indeed, we know that some regulations protect people against cancer, a risk that people are willing to pay a premium to avoid, whereas other regulations protect people against sudden unanticipated death, a risk that occasions less in the way of public concern.161 So too, some regulations affect the poor more than the rich, urban people more than rural people, and so forth. Under the very theory that animates current regulatory practice, individualized VSLs, taking account of these differences, are important.
Second, regulatory decisions affect more people than a tort award does, and thus are more politically salient. The greater political salience of regulatory decisions may
problems for those who believe that ethical
require all deaths to be valued the same way. But it appears to be politically difficult to draw the logical conclusion that VSLs for poor people should be lower than have good effects simply because public scrutiny can be a corrective against ill-motivated or foolish decisions but here we focus on some bad or troubling effects. The most obvious is that the symbolism of sensible and disaggregated regulatory decisions may bother people because such decisions seem in conflict with other values?here, we have in mind the controversy valuing human lives at all, or the likely more intense controversy over valuing the lives of the rich more than the lives of the poor.162 The risks of public skepticism may also explain agencies? failure to value the lives of children properly and openly.
By contrast, the isolation of tort awards suppresses these symbolic concerns. Almost no one complains about the fact that poor people obtain lower damages in tort awards because they have lost less future income and the existence of the disparity, and its longstanding character, at least raises principles VSLs for rich people in regulatory decisionmaking.
We are unable to explain why agencies have neglected the losses to dependents. One possible answer is that agencies assume that victims? WTPs for bearing risks of death incorporate these costs but as we have explained, it is unlikely that these WTPs incorporate these costs fully. Another possible answer is lack of information it is not easy to generate a plausible number to capture the costs to dependents on some population-wide basis. But this problem ought to be remediable. A probable contributor to the gap is that cost-benefit analysis and the use of VSLs is in its infancy?as a formal part of regulatory law, it is only about twenty-five years old163?and agencies have focused on the large problems while neglecting or overlooking more subtle issues. But it is now time for the VSL methodology to advance to a new stage of sophistication.
It is clear that wealth differences would have been seen in wrongful death and survivors?
of simple ?noise? in the system.
Second, suppose that an agency had, prior to the 9/11 attack, issued regulations designed to force the owners of buildings such as the World Trade Center to install safety
a terrorist attack or similar disaster. Here,
B. September 11 and Compensation
The different orientations of tort and regulatory law were reflected in an interesting way by the decisionmaking process of the commission that was set up to award compensation to victims of the 9/11 terrorist attack. We have briefly outlined the resulting regulations. Before returning to this topic, let us conduct two thought experiments.
First, suppose that Congress had never set up the 9/11 compensation fund, and instead the victims and survivors had sued under state tort law. Suppose they succeeded in establishing the liability of defendants such as the airlines. How would damages have been awarded?
awards. The dependents of investment bankers would have obtained awards far in excess of those obtained by the dependents of fire fighters. In addition, the awards would have varied significantly in light of the different characteristics of each victim. But there also would have been considerable inexplicable variance in the awards, variance that would not be traceable to relevant factors but to the vagaries of jury decisionmaking and the law of tort. Hence inequalities would have been pervasive? some a justified product of existing rules, others a result devices that would have saved lives in case of
we can be sure that the agency would have used uniform valuations?such as $6.1 million per life saved?that would have ignored wealth differences and other differences between victims. The agency would also have ignored dependents.
How did the 9/11 commission make its decisions? On the one hand, the commission was directed by Congress to rely on tort principles, and for that reason it used formulas that took into account wealth differences.164 Estates of investment bankers did receive more compensation than estates of fire fighters.165 In addition, awards were an increasing function of the number of dependents. On the other hand, public and political discomfort with these disparate awards?which seemed to dishonor the fire fighters, and also to distinguish victims along class lines?led the commission to adopt awards that were less dispersed than would have occurred under the tort system.166
9/11 Commission combined the virtues and flaws of both approaches.
There is a lesson here. Because individual tort cases concern just one person or a few people, awards are unlikely to be politically salient or to be influenced by irrelevant political considerations. But because they are ex post and individualized, they usually fail to take advantage of information that is accessible only at the level of the general population. The Because of the political salience of the task, and because awarding damages to thousands of people made comparison easy and obvious, the commission was constrained, like regulatory agencies, to use relatively uniform numbers recall that a standard number was used for noneconomic damages. At the same time, arbitrariness was therefore limited?in the sense that people in similar circumstances received similar awards. Because the commission was directed to use tort principles, the numbers were not fully uniform, and a degree of individual variation was properly allowed. But the use of tort principles also made it impossible to use figures for hedonic losses, and instead the commission relied on flawed figures such as lost income, with the result that average awards?in the $2 to
$3 million range?were less than the hedonic losses that actually occurred, according to the VSL methodology used by agencies.167
In normal situations, significant improvements are possible. Courts can, and ought to, take advantage of information about average persons when the relevant information about a particular victim is lacking (such as WTP to avoid the risk that produced death).168 And although politics will always constrain agencies, there are certainly many steps that agencies can take to improve their use of VSLs without running afoul of political constraints. At a minimum, we see no reason why agencies cannot estimate the losses to dependents of people who are killed by regulated conduct, and it seems likely to us that at least some kinds of individualization will be possible?by, for example, giving a premium for risks that are especially dreaded.
is that it does not include the welfare loss to the decedent its current reliance on the Conclusion
In the United States, two independent bodies of law assign dollar values to deaths. Regulatory agencies, drawing on willingness to pay studies, use a uniform number that takes no account of losses to dependents and others. In wrongful death actions, courts attempt to compensate survivors, failing to incorporate the loss to the decedent and ensuring a high degree of variability in awards. For both bodies of law, deterrence is an important goal, and from the standpoint of deterrence, both make serious blunders. And for both, a key question is how to combine accuracy and administrability.
There are two central problems with regulatory law. First, the value of a statistical life is uniform rather than disaggregated. The very theory that underlies current practice calls for far more in the way of individuation. Second, agency figures do not include the losses to dependents and others the result is underdeterrence. We have made suggestions about how agencies might remedy these two problems. The central problem with tort law decedent?s pre-death losses and the dependents? losses results in undervaluation of
morality risks, and hence underdeterrence. We have also made suggestions about how both bodies of law should deal with the deaths of children and foreigners.
If our recommendations were accepted, we would expect tort awards to become higher, more uniform, and less arbitrary than they currently are. We would also expect VSLs used by regulatory agencies to be more variable?in many cases lower and in many cases higher. The inclusion of losses to dependents should result in more stringent regulations, as the effective benefit from a life saved would be increased.
