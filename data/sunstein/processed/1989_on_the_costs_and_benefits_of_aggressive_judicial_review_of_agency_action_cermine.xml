      <p>In this essay, I undertake three tasks. The first is to describe some
of the difficulties of defining "benefits" in the setting of judicial review of
administrative action. The second task is to offer reasons, though
tentative and largely anecdotal ones, for an affirmative answer to the question
whether aggressive judicial review has produced "net benefits." At the
very least, I suggest, aggressive judicial review has had significant
benefits in many settings. The third and final task is to outline some
proposals by which to increase the benefits, and decrease the risks, of an
aggressive judicial posture in administrative law.</p>
      <p>I.</p>
      <p>THE VARIOUS "BENEFITS" OF JUDICIAL REVIEW</p>
      <p>For those assessing the value of judicial review of administrative
action, the first problem is one of definition. In this context, the criteria for
evaluation are elusive, and shift dramatically with context. Even so, it is
possible to identify at least four different sets of criteria, all of which have
been invoked in recent discussion.'</p>
      <p>The most obvious goal, or "benefit," of judicial review is to increase
the incidence of legality. Under this view, 2 judicial review of
administrative action is necessary above all to ensure that regulatory agencies
comply with congressional commands. Far from being an enemy of the
democractic process, judicial review is its indispensable ally, since it
ensures administrative fidelity to public desires expressed in legislative
commands. A major premise of this view is that implementing agencies have
an electoral pedigree inferior to that of the Congress-the
constitution* Karl N. Llewellyn Professor of Jurisprudence, Law School and Department of Political
Science, University of Chicago. This essay is a revised version of a talk delivered to the section on
administrative law of the Association of American Law Schools in January 1989.</p>

ally specified institution in the design of federal law.3</p>
      <p>If legality is the goal of judicial review, active judicial review might
well be desirable. There are good reasons to believe that courts have a
comparative advantage over agencies in deciding what the law is.4 But
an increase in legality might not improve social welfare by,any measure.
A statute might be foolish, for example; it might impose costs that
outweigh any benefits. A possible example is the Delaney Clause,5 which
forbids any carcinogens in food additives. The prohibition applies to
carcinogens posing trivial risks, and for that reason it has the potential to
impose costs-including harms to health resulting from the substitution
of noncarcinogenic but risky substances for carcinogenic substances
posing de minimis risks-that would dwarf its benefits.6 ' A court that
required literal compliance with the Delaney Clause might increase legality
but decrease net social benefits.</p>
      <p>Under a second view, the goal of judicial review is to promote
efficient resource allocation.7 The principal concern here is that regulatory
3. For criticism of this view, see Mashaw, Prodelegation: Why Administrators Should Make
PoliticalDecisions, 1J.L. EcON. &amp; ORG. 81, 91-99 (1985) (arguing for broad statutory delegation of
authority to administrators).</p>
      <p>4. For a defense of this proposition, see Sunstein, ConstitutionalismAfter the New Deal, 101

Administrative State, 133 U. PA. L. REv. 549, 582-92 (1985) (favoring interpretive competence of
agencies).</p>
      <p>If the goal of judicial review is to promote legality, an expansive interpretation of Chevron,
U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984) (suggesting that courts should defer to agency
interpretations of law when the statute is ambiguous or when Congress has not "directly addressed
the precise question at issue"), would be a serious mistake. Courts could not defer to congressional
interpretations of ambiguous constitutional provisions without grossly distorting basic principles of
separation of powers. So too, judicial deference to agency views about "pure" questions of statutory
meaning would upset longstanding principles to the effect that those limited by legal authority
should not be empowered to decide on the scope of the limitation. Foxes, in short, should not guard
henhouses. See Sunstein, supra, at 464-69.</p>
      <p>One might emphasize this point while at the same time agreeing that courts should defer to
agency views when Congress has told them to do so, or to agency view.s on questions, including legal
questions, that call for the distinctive factfinding and policymaking competence of the agency-a
point that supports the result in Chevron itself. A respect for the judicial role in deciding on the
scope of an agency's legal authority, for the agency's institutional competence, and for Congress'
power to allocate interpretive authority, all appear to underlie the discussion in INS v.
CardozaFonseca, 480 U.S. 421 (1987)-perhaps the most sensible treatment of these issues in the last two
decades.</p>

agencies might undertake action whose real-world benefits are exceeded
or even dwarfed by their real-world costs, measured in economic terms.
In these circumstances, judicial review might serve as a corrective.
Courts might, for example, ensure against excessive intervention in the
marketplace; or they might compel agencies to consider the effects of
private conduct-for example, pollution-whose extremely high social
costs are insufficiently taken into account by the marketplace.</p>
      <p>If the goal of judicial review is efficient resource allocation, that goal
might be promoted as a result of judicial invalidation of agency action or
inaction deemed "arbitrary" or "capricious." '8 But judicial promotion of
efficient resource allocation may or may not overlap with other beneficial
goals, such as compliance with a statute ("legality"). Statutory
requirements sometimes promote the goal of efficient resource allocation, but
frequently they are directed toward other ends, and in such cases the
promotion of legality will conflict with the goal of efficient resource
allocation.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>C. Real-World Improvements of an Eclectic Sort.</title>
      <p>A third conception of the purpose of judicial review also focuses on
real-world improvements, but selects a quite different set of goals. Under
this view, 9 courts should not only promote better resource allocation in
an economic sense, but might also, or even alternatively, attempt to: (a)
ensure a better distribution of wealth; (b) promote the various nonmarket
or noncommodity values contained in statutes that, for example, regulate
broadcasting or protect endangered species and the environment; 10 and
(c) work against discrimination directed at various groups, including
blacks, women, and the handicapped.</p>
      <p>On this view, one would evaluate judicial review by asking if it
brings about these various goals. Net benefits would be found when
courts sensibly promote these goals; net costs would be found if they fail
to do so. Here, too, the connection between legality in the sense of
adherence to statute and real-world improvements is uncertain and
sometimes merely coincidental. But since many statutes are in fact designed
to promote goals of this sort, judicial efforts to ensure fidelity to law will
often also result in practical changes in this direction.</p>

capricious).</p>

L.J. 1537 (1983).
D.</p>
      <p>Under the traditional view, associated most closely with the work of
Kenneth Culp Davis and Louis Jaffe, the basic function of the courts
might be described as the promotion of "legitimacy" in the
administrative process.11 This is an ill-defined concept, but it is associated with
such conventional notions as ensurance of legality, protection against
arbitrariness and selectivity, promotion of procedural regularity, and
ensurance against the twin evils of factional tyranny and self-interested
representation. A particular fear of this view is that well-organized
private groups ("special interests") often have disproportionate influence
over administrative processes-a phenomenon that provides the basic
insight behind the extensive literature on agency "capture." 12</p>
      <p>This view places great emphasis on judicial independence, which
serves as an important safeguard, providing both an ex ante deterrent
and as an ex post check against the domination of administrative
processes by irrelevant or illegitimate considerations. On this view,
moreover, an aggressive judicial role is necessary in order to introduce
some of the traditional virtues of Anglo-American law into the
administrative process. Here, as with the goal of legality, the "benefits" of
judicial review are not evaluated directly in terms of its consequences for the
world. The goals of judicial review are of a more diffuse sort, and have
no necessary or linear connection with good regulatory outcomes.</p>
      <p>Both critical and approving evaluations of the judicial process are
often confused by a failure to distinguish among these various criteria.
Thus, for example, courts have been criticized for adhering to statutory
text at society's expense, and at the same time for promoting social
welfare at the expense of the statutory text.1 3 Courts might do an excellent
job of promoting fidelity to law, but at the same time, and perhaps as a
direct result, bring about a less sensible system of regulation. By the
same token, courts might introduce necessary regulatory controls but do
so with a weak or uncertain statutory warrant.</p>
      <p>In assessing judicial review, then, it is important to be careful to
spell out the relevant criteria. While selection of those criteria is a
value11. See K. DAVIS, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW TREATISE § 29.1 (2d ed. 1979); L. JAFFE, JUDICIAL
CONTROL OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION (1965).</p>
      <p>12. See generally THE POLITICS OF REGULATION (J. Wilson ed. 1981) (collection of essays
seeking to determine how regulatory agencies ordinarily operate and develop to their degree of
influence by private powers); P. QUIRK, INDUSTRY INFLUENCE IN FEDERAL REGULATORY AGENCIES
(1981) (addressing incentives acting on regulatory agencies to adopt pro-industry policies); K.
SCHLOZMAN &amp; J. TIERNEY, ORGANIZED INTERESTS AND AMERICAN DEMOCRACY (1986).</p>
      <p>13. An example is R. MELNICK, REGULATION AND THE COURTS: THE CASE OF THE CLEAN
AIR ACT (1983) (examining how federal courts have influenced policymaking in the regulation of air
pollution), which, despite its numerous virtues, suffers from this problem.
laden task, it is probably fair to say that both courts and observers have
paid less attention than they should to the effects ofjudicial review on the
real world of regulation--effects that are crucial to an evaluation of the
judicial role. It is in large part because of our considerable ignorance on
this score that the study of administrative law remains in a primitive
state.</p>
      <p>II.</p>
      <p>THE "NET BENEFITS" PRODUCED BY AGGRESSIVE</p>
      <p>Whatever the relevant criteria, it is difficult to make confident
statements in the abstract, about the benefits and costs of aggressive judicial
review of administrative action. It is surely imaginable, in certain times
and places, that aggressive judicial review will both increase illegality and
decrease social welfare on any view. Indeed, one could argue that this
was precisely the pattern in the period immediately before and after the
New Deal, when courts invoked a principle calling for narrow
construction of regulatory power. 14</p>
      <p>More recently, aggressive judicial review has produced regulatory
irrationality in a variety of areas. Professor Mashaw has shown that the
courts' simultaneous hospitality toward administrative recalls of
defective vehicles and hostility toward ex ante motor vehicle regulation have
pushed automobile safety regulation in peculiar directions. The net
result tends toward regulation through random, ex post directives rather
than through managerially coherent, ex ante controls.1 5 In the same
vein, the courts' literal approach to the Delaney Clause has increased
regulatory irrationality by imposing serious costs and in fact bringing
about fewer rather than more improvements in safety and health.' 6</p>
      <p>On the other hand, it is fully imaginable that aggressive judicial
review will both increase legality and improve social welfare.
Commentators can invoke considerations at a high level of generality that bear on
this problem, and indeed such considerations form the staple of academic
14. See, eg., FTC v. Eastman Kodak Co., 274 U.S. 619, 625 (1927) (Commission had no
authority to require company to divest labs acquired before action by Commission); FTC v. Gratz, 253
U.S. 421, 427 (1920) (meaning of "unfair method of competition" is for the courts, not the
Commission, to determine). See generally Fordham &amp; Leach, Interpretationof Statutes in Derogationof the
Common Law, 3 VAND. L. REV. 438 (1950) (noting increasing reliance on statutes rather than
common law), and cases cited therein.</p>
      <p>15. See Mashaw &amp; Harsft, Regulation andLegal Culture: The CaseofMotor Vehicle Safety, 4
YALE J. ON REG. 257, 263 (1987) (arguing that judicial review is a cause of National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration's shift from rules to recalls).</p>
      <p>16. See, e-g.,'Public Citizen v. Young, 831 F.2d 1108, 1111-22 (D.C. Cir. 1987), cert. denied,
108 S. Ct. 1470 (1988) (Delaney Clause does not contain an implicit de minimus exception; FDA
listing decisions for Orange No. 17, with cancer risk of I in 19 billion, and Red No. 19, with cancer
risk of I in 9 million, must be changed).
debates on these matters. Judicial lack of accountability, the judges'
ignorance of the often complex matters at hand, the delays and formality
built into the litigation process, and the courts ad hoc, case-by-case
approach to regulatory issues are certainly likely to impair judicial
performance in overseeing administration.' 7 At the same time, judicial
independence might serve as a protection against the various pressures
that produce administrative illegality, injustice, and irrationality. 18 In
recent years, there has been extensive documentation of the distorting
effects of various pressures placed on regulators. 19 Such evidence
provides at least a plausible basis to believe that courts, precisely because of
their independence, will provide a crucial deterrent and ex post
corrective. 20</p>
      <p>Pitched at this level of generality, however, considerations of this
sort are unlikely to be conclusive. Much will depend on context-on the
particular substantive area and on the incentives, good faith, and
competence ofjudges and administrators at any particular time. An evaluation
of how these considerations have in fact played out over the past, say,
fifty years must await extensive empirical investigation.</p>
      <p>Even in the absence of a systematic treatment, however, it is possible
to point to reasons to believe that aggressive judicial review, evaluated
under any criterion, has been desirable in many contexts. Aggressive
review serves as a powerful ex ante deterrent to lawless or irrational agency
behavior. In some settings, it also strengthens both analytic processes
and accountability to superiors within agencies.2 1 In this sense, judicial
review should be evaluated in terms of its systemic consequences for the
administrative process, which takes place in the shadow of judicial
review. Those consequences frequently have been desirable, above all
because of the in terroram effect of the prospect of judicial scrutiny. A
brief look at recent Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reports on
the regulatory programs of the United States demonstrates that judicial
decrees are important in producing executive compliance with law. 22</p>
      <p>It is also possible to show that aggressive judicial review has often
provided significant benefits both in bringing about desirable regulatory
initiatives and in preventing unreasonable or unlawful regulation.
Examples are numerous, and indeed on balance extraordinary. Judicial
initiatives helped bring about regulation of DDT 23 and airborne lead 24;
control of asbestos, beryllium, and mercury 25; regulation of atmospheric
loading, which produces acid deposition, 26 disclosure requirements for
hazardous chemicals 27; and regulation in the workplace of ethylene oxide
and formaldehyde. 28 The federal courts also prevented the government
from eliminating passive restraint rules. 29 The Supreme Court's
invalidation of an extremely hasty and ill-considered decision to scrap those rules
will ultimately save many lives. In the areas of communications and
broadcasting, an aggressive judiciary has helped ensure high quality
programming, diversity, local control, and sensitivity to the interests of
minority groups.3 0 In addition, the Prevention of Significant Deterioration
(PSD) program--calling for, among other things, protection of pristine
areas from environmental degradation-is a product of an aggressive
fed3 1
eral court.</p>
      <p>22. See, eg., OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET, EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE
PRESIDENT, REGULATORY PROGRAM OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT 50, (Apr. 1, 1986-Mar. 31,
1987) [hereinafter REGULATORY PROGRAM OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT] (discussing
Department of Commerce amendments to the Coastal Zone Management Act in order to conform to
Secretary of the Interior v. California, 464 U.S. 312 (1984), which held federal sale of outer
continental shelf oil and gas leases not activity directly affecting coastal zone within meaning of § 307(c)(2)).
See generally REGULATORY PROGRAM OF THE UNITED STATES, 1985-90 (filled with illustrations of
regulatory initiatives undertaken because of judicial compulsion).</p>
      <p>26. NRDC v. EPA, 489 F.2d 390 (5th Cir. 1974), rev'd, 421 U.S. 60 (1975).</p>
      <p>30. See Stewart, supra note 10, at 1582.</p>
      <p>31. See, eg., Sierra Club v. Ruckelshaus, 344 F. Supp. 253, 256 (D.D.C. 1972) (granting
preliminary injunction to prevent EPA approval of state plans that would allow air pollution to rise to
secondary levels pursuant to the Clean Air Act of 1970). As we will see, the PSD program is far
from perfect, see infra notes 46-52 and accompanying text; but the basic idea of protecting pristine
areas is sound.</p>
      <p>In addition to bringing about regulatory initiatives that are
desirable, courts have played an important role in ensuring against overzealous
or irrational regulation. Here too, the aggregate picture is quite
extraordinary and reveals judicial protections against many ill-considered
intrusions. For example, courts have invalidated an indefensible
secondary standard for sulfur dioxide; 32 struck down draconian regulation of
the automobile 33 and cement industries; 34 required a quite sensible
showing of a "significant risk" before OSHA may regulate the workplace; 35
and invalidated extremely aggressive transportation control plans written
by the EPA.36</p>
      <p>Examples of this sort amount to little more than anecdotes. This
can hardly dispose of the issue. But they are highly suggestive. They
indicate that a world without aggressive judicial review might well suffer
from increases in lawlessness, carelessness, overzealous regulatory
controls, and inadequate regulatory protection. Aggressive judicial review
has produced important ex ante and ex post benefits in numerous
settings; and although the evidence is largely anecdotal and far from
systematic, it must suffice absent a more sustained investigation into the
issue.</p>
      <p>III.</p>
      <p>PROPOSED PRINCIPLES TO INCREASE "NET BENEFITS"</p>
      <p>We have seen that it is difficult to say in the abstract whether
aggressive judicial review of administrative action has produced, or will
produce, significant advantages. In these circumstances, a major task is to
develop principles of interpretation that will improve the situation.
Public law thus far lacks a set of interpretive norms that are well-adapted to
the purposes, operation, and occasional failures of regulatory legislation.
For this reason, the area of statutory construction of administrative
behavior remains undeveloped. In this section, I outline, in summary
fashion, some principles that courts might bring to bear on regulatory
problems. 37 Most of these principles, which might be embodied in clear
statements principles or interpretive "canons," already have some
support in existing law.</p>
      <p>Statutes should be construed so that the aggregate social benefits are
proportionate to the aggregate social costs. This principle, implicit in
some of the recent cases, 38 recognizes that a proportionality principle will
likely produce sensible regulation and therefore is the appropriate
understanding to attribute to Congress under normal circumstances. The
principle also recognizes that well-organized groups are sometimes able to
obtain legislation that would not be the outcome of a well-functioning
deliberative process; that bureaucratic incentives can press agencies in
the direction of overzealous enforcement; that the statutory text is
sometimes an impulsive reaction to short-term problems; that temporary
public concern can result in hasty drafting; and that Congress is not able to
focus on all applications of statutory standards. The purpose of the
proportionality principle is to ensure that in the absence of a clear legislative
statement, statutes are understood to impose costs commensurate with
their benefits. Under this view, of course, costs and benefits need not be
measured technically, in accordance with the willingness-to-pay
criterion, but instead would be assessed in accordance with looser
understandings about proportionality.</p>
      <p>The proportionality principle has played a role in two important
recent decisions. In Industrial Union Department v. American Petroleum
Institute, the Supreme Court interpreted the toxic substances provision
of the Occupational Safety and Health Act to require a showing of a
"significant risk" before the Secretary of Labor can regulate toxic
substances.3 9 The plurality referred explicitly to the problem of de minimis
health benefits imposed for huge expense.40 In NRDC v. EPA, the
United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit concluded that the
EPA could take account of economic and technological feasibility in
setting the "margin of safety" for hazardous pollutants. 4 1 Here too the
court expressed concern that an alternative interpretation might require
37. A much more detailed treatment of this problem can be found in a forthcoming article,
Sunstein, InterpretingStatutesin the RegulatoryState, 103 HARV. L. REv. (forthcoming 1989) and a
forthcoming book, C. SUNSTEIN, THE REGULATORY STATE (1989 draft). Both deal with numerous
interpretive principles with which to approach regulatory statutes.</p>
      <p>38. See, e.g., IndustrialUnionDep't, 448 U.S. at 639-59; NRDC v. EPA, 824 F.2d 1146 (D.C.
Cir. 1987).</p>

regulation that was irrational because it imposed enormous costs for
minimal gains.42</p>
      <p>Both of these decisions can be understood as responsive to the fact
that stringent statutory requirements tend to bring about a paradoxical
regime of simultaneous over-regulation and under-regulation. When the
statute does not contain a proportionality principle, agencies tend to
over-regulate those substances that get on the agenda; but they are
simultaneously reluctant to regulate many substances at all, which therefore
go entirely uncontrolled. One consequence of draconian standards is
thus to leave the marketplace unregulated in many settings.43 A
proportionality principle is a useful corrective.</p>
      <p>It follows from the proportionality principle that administrators
should generally be authorized to refuse to impose costly regulations for
highly speculative or minimal gains."4 Many courts have reached
precisely this conclusion, holding that in the absence of a clear congressional
statement, administrators may make de minimis exceptions to regulatory
controls.4 5 Indeed, courts probably should require such exceptions in the
absence of explicit statutory text or plausible substantive justifications to
the contrary.</p>

      <p>44. Courts have reached somewhat conflicting conclusions on this point, although the general
background rule seems to be in favor of de minimis exceptions. See Public Citizen v. Young, 831

      <title>UnderstandingSystemic Effects.</title>
      <p>Regulation is frequently unsuccessful, or less successful than it
should be, because of a legislative or administrative failure to understand
the complex systemic effects of governmental controls. The problem of
perverse unintended consequences is a pervasive one.4 6 A similar failure
has undermined interpretive efforts by the federal courts. Consider, for
example, the court's creation-in the face of an ambiguous text-of the
"prevention of significant deterioration" (PSD) program in SierraClub v.
Ruckleshaus.4 7 In that case, the court ruled that state implementation
plans under the Clean Air Act 48 must include provisions not merely
complying with national air quality standards, but also designed to
prevent the degradation of air currently cleaner than required by those
standards.49 One of the court's apparent goals was to ensure that federal
environmental policy would protect visibility in currently pristine
areas. 50 While its decision has promoted that goal to some degree, it also
has been immensely expensive, has delayed the substitution of
lowsulphur western coal for high-sulfur eastern coal, and has perversely
protected dirty existing plants against replacement with cleaner new ones.5 1
It is far from clear that the environment is better off as a result. The
Sierra Club court was unaware of these effects. Because the statutory
basis for the decision was quite thin, an understanding of the
environmental and nonenvironmental costs associated with the PSD program
might well have led to a narrower or even contrary result.</p>
      <p>Similar examples are provided by the Supreme Court's OSHA
decisions, in which the Court, or several of its members, appeared to assume
that greater protection for workers would follow automatically from
more stringent statutory requirements.5 2 As we have seen, this
assumption disregards the fact that stringent requirements tend to lead an
agency not to regulate at all, thus producing under-regulation. It also

feasibilty).
ignores the risk that such requirements might impose costs that
ultimately will be borne by workers themselves.</p>
      <p>In short, courts dealing with regulatory issues commonly
misunderstand the systemic effects of administrative controls, and act as if the
decision will create only ex post winners and losers in the particular case.
This misunderstanding leads to statutory construction that is uninformed
by the real-world impact of regulation-and the real-world impact, while
not by itself decisive, is frequently relevant to the question of statutory
meaning.</p>

    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>CautiousApproach to Legislative History.</title>
      <p>Legislative history is sometimes written by one or another side in a
dispute over the content of the law, and the history will sometimes reflect
a view whose advocates were unable to prevail during congressional
deliberations.5 3 Moreover, Congress enacts laws, not the comments of
some of its members about what those laws mean. All this supports a
firm principle in favor of the priority of statutory text to statutory
history.</p>
      <p>Properly understood, this principle does not call on courts to
disregard the history, but counsels them to give the history limited weight in
cases of arguable conflict. Consider, for example, section 111 of the
Clean Air Act,54 an ambiguous provision that could be interpreted to call
for administrative concentration on environmental benefits, but whose
conference report language suggests an effort-unsuccessful in Congress
as a whole-to convert the environmental laws into protectionism for
eastern coal producers.5 5 A court that accorded great weight to the
history to clarify ambiguous text might well have permitted the conference
report to bring about that conversion. But a court that accepted the
priority of the text would interpret it to ensure against a statutory "deal"
destructive of both the environment and the economy.</p>

      <title>Coordination.</title>
      <p>It should come as no surprise that the post-New Deal proliferation
of regulatory programs has led to inconsistency and sometimes
incoherence in the law. For example, the standards for regulating carcinogens

are notoriously variable, calling for excessive controls in some areas and
unduly weak regulation in others.5 6 The absence of centralization has led
to regulatory failures in numerous areas.57</p>
      <p>A partial solution would call on courts to employ clear statement
principles of statutory construction so as to help bring about consistency
and coordination in the law. A judicial role of this sort has clear
precedent both in the old idea that statutes governing the same subject matter
should be construed together5 8 and in contemporary administrative law.
In Bob Jones University v. UnitedStates, for example, the Supreme Court
held that the Internal Revenue Service could not grant tax deductions to
private schools that discriminate on the basis of race.5 9 The source of the
prohibition was a statute giving deductions to institutions serving
charitable purposes, but with an implicit exception when "public policy"
requires denial of the deduction. There is no doubt that, when the statute
was initially enacted, "public policy" did not prohibit deductions to
institutions that discriminated on the basis of race. Racial discrimination in
education was common at the time, and it could not plausibly be
suggested that the enacting Congress thought that discriminatory schools
violated public policy. The Bob Jones decision is best understood as an
effort to ensure that the IRS takes account of the widespread social
antagonism toward racial discrimination, since that antagonism now forms
a part of the general thrust of contemporary "public policy." The
underlying idea was that the statute should be construed in a way that
conforms to current views about racial discrimination in education. Some
cases limiting agency authority to impose significant costs for uncertain
or speculative benefits can be understood in similar terms, as an effort to
bring about coherence in the law and conformity with current norms and
practices.60</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>Obsolescence.</title>
      <p>A large problem for modem regulation is that of
obsolescence-statutory requirements that are inconsistent with new developments of fact,
policy, and law. Statutes may no longer be consistent with widely held
social norms. The legal background may have changed dramatically as a
result of judicial and legislative innovations; the factual assumptions
underlying an old statute may no longer hold. In all of these cases, the
question is whether changing circumstances justify a change in
interpretation.</p>
      <p>In the areas of banking, broadcasting, and carcinogen regulation,
judicial interpretation has sometimes been a straightforward response to
changed circumstances. 61 Here it is implausible to resolve statutory
ambiguities by asking how Congress would have answered the question at
the time of enactment. In light of the changed nature of the relevant
markets, such an approach would be a recipe for absurdity. At least if
the language so permits, there is no alternative but to extrapolate
purposes at a certain level of generality and to assess the changed
circumstances in light of those purposes.</p>
      <p>Consider, as a particular example, the problem of interpreting the
Delaney Clause. 62 As was seen, the Clause contains a general prohibition
on the use of substances that "induce" cancer as food additives, and was
enacted in a period when carcinogens could be detected only at high-risk
levels. The enacting Congress assumed that carcinogenic substances
were both rare and extremely dangerous. Now, however, carcinogenic
substances appear omnipresent, and often pose little danger. Should the
statute be interpreted to permit de minimis exceptions in a time in which
carcinogens can be detected at exceptionally low levels posing trivial
risks to health?</p>
      <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), invoking the changed
character of scientific knowledge, says yes; a federal court has said no. 63
In the court's view, the provision said what it meant and meant what it
said, and that was that. But read in its context, there was no such clarity
in the Delaney Clause. Congress simply did not focus on the question of
de minimis risks. Indeed, it could not have done so in light of the state of
scientific knowledge with respect to carcinogenic substances. It was
therefore a myth to say that the congressional enactment resolved the
"risk free workplace"); NRDC v. EPA, 824 F.2d 1146, 1164 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (restricting EPA from
considering cost and technical feasibility in determining what is "safe").</p>
      <p>61. See Langevoort, Statutory Obsolescenceand the JudicialProcess:The RevisionistRole of the
Courts in FederalBankingRegulation, 85 MICH. L. REv. 672 (1987).</p>
      <p>62. See supra note 5.
63. See supra note 16.
question in the face of unanticipated scientific developments. Nor can it
be said that the FDA's de minimis exception "amended" the Clause.
The question is the meaning of the clause in light of the new
circumstances. Might the word "induce" contain a de minimis exception? The
answer to that question will inevitably depend on interpretation.</p>
      <p>A more nuanced approach to the problem of obsolescence can be
found in judicial constructions of statutes of the 1920s and 1930s
requiring old-line agencies to take account of environmental concerns. 64 Here
the legal background has changed so dramatically that what might seem
to be a straightforward interpretation of the old statutes would produce
incoherence. The problem of obsolescence also helps explain the courts'
narrow construction of provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code
(UCC) that had not anticipated the consumer revolution in the law of
products liability. 65</p>
      <p>Dean Calabresi has argued that courts should have the power to
invalidate obsolete statutes, returning them to the legislature for
reconsideration. 6 6 A judicial role of this sort would be extremely
controversial, and properly so. The principal problem posed by obsolescence or
changed circumstances is that it makes interpretation in the ordinary
sense far more difficult. Efforts to translate statutes into new settings
cannot be made simply by asking what the statute meant when it was
enacted. A principle that calls for courts to exercise some creativity here
provides a far less intrusive function for the courts, and it has
unmistakable foundations in current law.</p>
      <p>CONCLUSION</p>
      <p>The question whether aggressive judicial review of administrative
action has produced "net benefits" poses difficulty most notably because
of the absence of clear criteria by which to make the assessment. Courts
have the responsibility both to ensure legality and to prevent
arbitrariness, and a decision to bring about compliance with the governing statute
may or may not produce more sensible regulation. The absence of clear
criteria and the lack of good empirical data make it exceptionally difficult
to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of aggressive judicial review. In
the abstract, one could imagine scenarios in which such review would be
alternatively indispensable and disastrous. Nonetheless, there is some
basis for believing that aggressive judicial review has, in many settings,
increased the incidence of legality, prevented arbitrariness, ensured
against undesirable regulation, and brought about regulatory controls
that have saved lives or otherwise accomplished considerable good.</p>
      <p>A major gap in current administrative law is the lack of an
understanding of the characteristic functions and failures of the regulatory
process, and a derivative understanding of the judicial role. Sympathetic
engagement with regulatory purposes, together with a solid
understanding of regulatory pathologies, ultimately might lead to a set of principles
by which courts could indeed bring about "net benefits" through judicial
review. No one should argue that the judiciary should play the central
role in ensuring legality, rationality, or justice in the administrative
process. But it would be difficult to deny that a judiciary suitably sensitive
to the functions and failures of the regulatory state might well make
things better rather than worse.</p>
