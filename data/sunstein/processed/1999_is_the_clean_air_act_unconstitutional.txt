Nondelegation and EPA

The American people are suffering  from what can be called "a syndrome
of paranoia and neglect"  about potential  dangers  to  their health,  safety,
and the  environment.  This leads  to a paradox  that is  becoming  increas-
ingly  recognized.  Large  amounts  of resources  are  devoted  to  slight  or
speculative  dangers  while  substantial  and well-documented  dangers  re-
main unaddressed.

-John  Graham'

The last  third of the twentieth century  is  not too  late a  time  for turning
the rule  of law and the non-delegation  doctrine  into  effective  and useful
legal tools for minimizing  injustice from improper discretionary  power.

-Kenneth  Culp Davis2

INTRODUCTION:  ENVIRONMENTAL  POLICY AND

ADMINISTRATIVE  LAW

This Article deals with two  linked questions.  The first involves the
future of the Clean  Air Act.'  The  particular concern is how  the Envi-
ronmental  Protection  Agency  ("EPA")  might  be .encouraged,  with
help  from reviewing  courts,  to  issue  better  ambient  air  quality  stan-
dards,  and in  the  process  to  shift  from  some  of the  anachronisms  of
1970s environmentalism  to  a more fruitful  approach  to  environmental
protection.  The  second  question  involves  the  role  of the nondelega-
tion doctrine  in American public law,  a doctrine  that shows  unmistak-
able  signs  of  revival.  I will  suggest  that  improved  performance  by
EPA  and  agencies  in  general,  operating  in  tandem  with  a  new  ap-
proach to judicial review, would make it altogether unnecessary  to re-
vive the nondelegation  doctrine.  Indeed,  the nondelegation  doctrine
would emerge  as  a crude  and unhelpful response  to  existing problems
in modern  regulation,  even  a  form  of judicial  usurpation.  Far  better
responses are available.

A.  Basic Proposals and First Principles

In  issuing  and  revising  a  national  ambient  air  quality  regulation
under  the  Clean  Air  Act,  EPA  should  provide  a  detailed  "benefits
analysis."  To this  end, it should  undertake  two  tasks.  First, it should

[Vol. 98:303

specify  the range  of benefits  that  it believes  are  likely to  result  from
the regulation,  along with  a specification  of the  range  of benefits that
it  believes  would  result  from  at  least  two  reasonable  alternative  ap-
proaches,  one  stricter  and  one  more  lenient. 
In  the  process  EPA
should  identify  the  residual risk left  under  the  competing  regulatory
regimes;  it  should  also  acknowledge  scientific  uncertainty,  to  the  ex-
tent  that  uncertainty  exists  and requires  guesswork.  This  proposal  is
an effort to  strengthen the role of sound science in  environmental  pro-
tection.

Second, EPA should explain  why it believes  that the  chosen rule is
preferable to the less and more stringent  alternatives - why the set of
benefits to be received from the selected  rule justify  that rule, whereas
the  set  of benefits  to  be  received  from  the  less  and  more  stringent
rules do  not.  In the process  it should explain  why the residual risk left
by  the  selected  rule  is  acceptable,  while  the  residual  risk  left  by  the
less  stringent  rule is  not.  This proposal  is  an  effort  to  strengthen the
role of democratic forces in environmental  protection.4

If  necessary,  reviewing  courts  should  require  EPA  to  perform
these  tasks.  Taken  together,  the  two  proposals  should  increase  the
level  of  consistency  across  regulations,  reduce  the  power  of  well-
organized  private  groups,  and diminish  the  risks  associated  with  both
insufficient  and  excessive  environmental  regulation.  If  EPA has  un-
dertaken  the two tasks,  and carried  them  out in  a reasonable  way, ju-
dicial review is at an end;  courts should uphold EPA's  decision.

Ideas  of this  kind  have  potentially  broad  implications,  extending
well beyond  the Clean Air Act  and  even EPA, to  the work  of the  Oc-
cupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration  ("OSHA"),  the  Con-
sumer  Product Safety  Commission,  and  the National  Highway Traffic
and Safety Administration  as well.  They would mark a key moment in
the movement  toward  a system of environmental  protection  that is  at
once  more  democratic  and  better  informed.  At the same  time,  they
would  accelerate  the  continuing  shift  from  1970s  environmentalism
and indeed 1970s  regulation in general,  away from recognizing  the  ex-
istence  of  problems  of  safety  and  health  and  toward  assessing  their
magnitude,  in  such  a  way  as  to reduce  both  regulatory  paranoia  and
regulatory  neglect,  and to  put a  premium  on the  acquisition  of infor-
mation

4.  Of course  costs are important too;  the two proposals  are based  on the current  under-
standing that benefits,  but not costs, may be  taken into account in issuing primary  standards.
The  question of costs is  taken up later.  See infra Section VI.C.

5.  For general  discussion in  this vein, see  STEPHEN BREYER,  BREAKING THE VICIOUS
CIRCLE:  ToWARD  EFFECTIVE  RISK  REGULATION  (1993),  and  NEIL  GUNNINGHAM  &
PETER  GRABOSKY,  SMART REGULATION:  DESIGNING  ENVIRONMENTAL  POLICY  (1998).

Nondelegation and EPA

If agencies  undertook tasks of this kind,  there would be  little point
to  the  recent  resurgence  of  interest  in  the  nondelegation  doctrine.
The  sensible  impulses  that underlie  that  interest  -
impulses  that  in-
volve  accountability,  deliberation,  and sound  policymaking -
can  be
handled  through  other  means,  a point  that  casts  a  more  general  light
on  the proper role  of the  nondelegation  doctrine  in American  public
law.  I suggest that the proper role of that doctrine  consists in statutory
construction  that imposes  floors  and ceilings  on  agency action,  and in
a  set  of  "nondelegation  canons"  that  prevent  agencies  from  acting
without  clear  congressional  authorization.  Taken  together,  judicial
requirements  of  this  kind  would  constitute  a  form  of  "democracy-
promoting  minimalism"' 
in  the  distinctive  context  of  administrative
law -
and a  partial step  toward  a  better  and  more  sophisticated  ap-
proach  to environmental  protection.  These  are  the basic claims  that I
will attempt to defend in this Article.

B.  The Clean Air Act

The Clean  Air Act may well be the most important  of all environ-
mental  statutes.  Its  effects  include  a  wide range  of beneficial  conse-
quences for human health and well-being  and high costs on the private
sector.  The Environmental  Protection  Agency estimates  overall  com-
pliance  costs  at  $0.5  trillion.7  The  Act's  claim  to  success  rests  on
enormous  improvements  in  ambient  air  quality  and  corresponding
health  benefits.  EPA  estimates  that  the Act  prevents  at least  45,000
deaths  annually  and that  it  also prevents  a  minimum  of 13,000  heart
attacks  and 7,000  annual  strokes!  On a  standard  (though not  undis-
puted) view,  the  benefits of the  Act, ranging  between  $5.6 trillion  and
$49.4 trillion, far exceed its costs.9

SUPREmE  COURT (1999),  on the general topic of judicial minimalism.

7.  See J. CLARENCE DAVIES  & JAN  MAZUREK,  POLLUTION  CONTROL  IN  THE UNITED

STATES:  EVALUATING  THE SYSTEM 130 (1998).

8.  See id. Judgments about benefits, nonmonetized  but especially monetized,  are highly
sensitive to contentions  assumptions, and hence  the  "bottom line"  numbers should be taken
with many grains of salt.  See RANDALL LUrrER, AN ANALYSIS OF THE USE OF THE EPA'S
BENEFIT  ESTIMATES 
IN  OMB's  DRAFT  REPORT  ON  THE  COSTS  AND  BENEFITS  OF
REGULATION  (1998)  (urging the  use of plausible  alternative  assumptions  and asserting  that
EPA's  benefit  calculations  are  inflated);  see  also  Lisa  Heinzerling,  Regulatory  Costs  of
Mythic Proportions, 107 YALE LJ. 1981 (1998)  (urging that costs per lives saved are inflated,
also because  of contentious  assumptions).  Though  coming  from  different directions,  Lutter
and  Heinzerling  both argue,  convincingly,  that  characterization  of both  benefits  and  costs
can  shift  dramatically  with small  changes in  assumptions, an  argument  that  much  bears  on
the central claims  of this Article.  See Randall  Lutter & Christopher  DeMuth, Ozone and the
Constitution at the EPA, ON THE ISSUES,  July 1999,  at 3.

[Vol.  98:303

The  Act  has  nonetheless  been  subject  to  telling  criticism.  The
foundation  of clear  air  regulation  consists  of EPA's  issuance  of na-
tionally uniform ambient  air quality standards;"  but in light of the ex-
traordinary  diversity  of the fifty  states, it  is not clear  that  the idea  of
national  standards  can  be  rationally  defended." 
In  addition,  both
lower  courts and EPA seem  to  think that the standard-setting  process
does not  and cannot involve consideration of costs.12  But does it make
sense,  or  is  it  even  feasible,  to  say  that  national  standards  will  be
founded  on  an assessment  of benefits  alone,  conducted  in  a  cost vac-
uum? 3 
If  an  improvement  in  ambient  air  quality  would  produce
health  benefits that  are  small but not trivial,  isn't it clear that  the  im-
provement  is  justified  if  compliance  costs  are  trivial,  but  not  if  the
costs  are  extremely  high?  There  is  reason  to  think  that  at  least  in
some  cases,  an  understanding  of  costs  has  affected  EPA's  decision
about appropriate standards  - but that the cost-benefit  balancing  has
been left implicit and free from public scrutiny and review. 4

Perhaps  the  largest  question  involves  the  criteria  by  which  EPA
decides whether  one  or another  level of regulation  is  (in the statutory
phrase)  "requisite  to protect the public health."15  For most pollutants,
air quality at various  levels is not either  "safe"  or  "not safe";  there are
diminishing  degrees  of risk  associated with  diminishing  degrees  of ex-
posure.  On what  basis  is  a particular  level of residual risk  said  to be
the  appropriate  one?  What  judgments  do,  or  should,  enter  into that
conclusion?  EPA has  been criticized  for sometimes  suggesting,  in  an
unhelpful  and conclusory  fashion,  that it chooses  the  "safe"  level, as if
this were  solely a technocratic judgment and  as if "safety"  were an on-
off switch, 6 when  its decision about permissible  levels  rests instead  on

the particulates  and ozone  regulations,  where  EPA noted  diminishing  risk with  diminishing
exposure levels;  but here too, EPA's explanation leaves many  open questions.

Nondelegation and EPA

a  series  of political,  scientific,  and  economic  judgments  and  compro-
mises.

There are two problems  with this  state of affairs.  The first involves
democratic  deliberation. 7  If EPA  does  not give  a  clear sense  of the
range of adverse  effects,  and if it does not say why one set of such ef-
fects  calls for regulation  and another  does not, the public  and its rep-
resentatives  are  not informed  of the  nature  of  the  underlying  ques-
tions,  and  they  are  unable  to  evaluate  the  choices  actually  made.
Under  EPA's  articulated  position,  a  purely  technical  issue  (would  a
certain  level be  safe?)  is  sometimes  substituted,  at least  publicly,  for
the real and  more complicated  ones  (what level of safety is  appropri-
ate in light of all the relevant factors?  why should one level of regula-
tion be preferred to another?).

The  second  problem  involves  sound  regulatory  policy.  Any  pro-
posed national standard  could be loosened  or tightened,  and the ques-
tion  is whether  the agency  has  chosen  the  optimal,  or  at  least  a rea-
sonable,  regulatory  "point."  Without  a  clear  and  (to  the  extent
possible)  quantified presentation  of the expected environmental  bene-
fits  of  the  various  alternatives,"  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the
agency  has chosen  that point,  rather than  one that  is too  strict  or too
lenient.

C.  A Remarkable Decision and a New Doctrine

In  its  extraordinary  decision  in  American  Trucking  Ass'ns  v.
EPA,9  the United  States Court of Appeals  for the District of Colum-
bia  Circuit  responded  to  this  last  concern  in  the  strongest  possible
terms.  It held  that  as  interpreted  by  EPA, the key  provisions  of the
those  that  give  EPA  authority  to  issue  national  air
Clean Air Act -
represent  an unconstitutional  delegation  of legis-
quality standards  -
lative power.10  The decision  announces  the birth  of a new nondelega-
tion  doctrine,  one  with  potentially  large  implications  for  regulatory
policy.  Under  the new  doctrine,  open-ended  statutory  terms  will be
invalidated unless  agencies  are  able to  specify the governing  legal  cri-
to  discipline  their  own authority  through narrowing  interpre-
teria -
tations.

17.  See id.
18.  Costs  are of course  important too.  As  discussed below,  the  prevailing view  forbids
EPA from considering costs, and my basic proposal does not challenge that prevailing  view.
I do, however, raise some doubts  about it below.  See infra Section VI.C.

[Vol.  98:303

The  new  nondelegation  doctrine  is  remarkable  for  many  reasons.
First, the Supreme  Court  has not used the doctrine  to invalidate  a fed-
eral  statute  since  (or  for  that  matter  before)  1935,1  and  hence  any
such  decision by  a court of appeals  is reasonably taken to mark a fresh
departure.  Second,  the  new  doctrine  does  not  require  Congress to
legislate  with  clarity.  It says  instead  that  if  Congress  has  not  been
clear,  agencies  must act on their  own, to set out limits on their  own le-
gal  authority.  Third,  there  now  appears  to  be  a  genuine  doctrine  in
place;  American  Trucking represents  no  isolated  decision,  but  the
culmination  of a line  of lower  court cases,  one  of which was  a  similar
decision  about  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Act.'  The  deci-
sion  therefore  signals  a  distinctive  approach  to  judicial  review  of
agency  action.  Fourth,  the  doctrine  is  conspicuously  responsive  to
what the court of appeals  saw (and  often sees)  as a general problem  in
federal  regulation:  the  difficulty  of knowing  why an  agency  chooses
one level of regulation rather  than another that is somewhat  higher  or
somewhat lower.

The  new  doctrine  raises  a  number  of  questions.  The  narrowest
(though far  from  unimportant)  issue  has  to  do  with  the fate  of EPA
rulemaking  with  respect  to  national  ambient  air  quality  standards
("NAAQS").  What, if anything, can EPA do in the future?  The ques-
tion is significant both because  of its consequences  for implementation
of  the  Clean  Air  Act  and  because  of its  implications  for  regulatory
policy  in general.  On  its face, the American  Trucking decision would
seem  to  draw  into  serious  constitutional  question  not  only  EPA's
ozone  and  particulates  regulations,  but  also  a  wide  range  of  other
regulations  by  EPA,  and  indeed  a  wide  range  of decisions  by  many
other  agencies  involved  in the  protection  of health  and welfare  (and
other  areas  as  well;  consider  the  Federal  Communications  Commis-
sion).  And what, exactly, is the relationship  between the new doctrine
and  ordinary  judicial  review  to  test whether  agency  action  has  been
"arbitrary"  or  "capricious"?  An  especially  large  question,  and  the
central  focus  here,  has  to  do  with  how  American  Trucking  exposes
continuing  problems  with the  design  and  implementation  of environ-
mental  regulation  as  a  whole  and  the  Clean  Air Act  in particular,  a
statute whose  key provisions  seem  to  depend  on  implausible  assump-
tions, and  under which  EPA  has  sometimes  hidden  crucial  questions
of value with  uninformative platitudes.

Nondelegation and EPA

D.  Goals and Plans

In this Article, my most  general goal is to  understand  current diffi-
culties  with environmental  policy, the Clean Air  Act, and EPA prom-
ulgation  of ambient  air  quality  standards,  and  to  see  how  EPA  and
courts  might  perform  a  constructive  role  in  making  things  better
rather  than  worse.  My  simplest  claim  is  that  EPA  should  undertake
the two  tasks identified  above;  it should  specify  the range of benefits
that  it believes  will follow  from  the regulation  it seeks  to  impose,  in-
cluding  a  discussion of the benefits from more lenient  and more  strin-
gent  alternatives  and a  treatment of the residual risks  under the vari-
ous  regulatory  regimes.  It should also  explain why it believes  that the
chosen regulation is preferable to the alternatives.

Steps  in  these  directions  would  satisfy  the  legitimate  concerns  of
most  critics  of EPA's performance  under the  Clean  Air Act  and  also
of the  court  of appeals  in  American Trucking.  Such  steps  also  have
broad applicability  and would  represent a  new departure  of their  own
in  administrative  law,  covering  the  activities  of  EPA  under  a  wide
range  of statutes  and also  the activities  of (for  example)  the Occupa-
tional  Safety  and  Health  Administration,  the  Consumer  Product
Safety  Commission,  and the National Highway  Traffic Safety  Admini-
stration.  Steps  of this  sort would not amount to  a nondelegation  doc-
trine, new  or old.  But  they are  designed  to  promote both  rule-of-law
values  and  sound  regulatory  policy,  in  a  way  that  should  respond to
growing  understandings  about  current  problems  in  environmental
policy and the administrative state.

I have  three  more  particular  goals.  The  first  is to  reject  the non-
delegation doctrine, both old and new, as a way  of ensuring better  and
more  transparent policy  analysis by EPA and other  agencies.  That is-
sue  raises  large  questions  about  democratic  accountability  and  about
the  appropriate  role  of  courts  in reviewing  agency  action.  I  suggest
that  although  the  new  doctrine  has  considerable  appeal,  this  is  not
really  a nondelegation  doctrine  at all, and the relevant goals  would be
better  accomplished  through  a form  of more  conventional  (but better
informed)  judicial  review  of  agency  action.  The  Clean  Air  Act  is
hardly unconstitutional,  for it is  possible  to generate  an interpretation
of the Act that imposes both "floors"  and "ceilings"  on agency action.
My second goal is  to propose a  contemporary role for the nondele-
gation  doctrine  in  American  public  law.  I claim  that  the  doctrine  is
properly  held in reserve for  extreme  cases -
that  it serves as  a genu-
ine,  but judicially  underenforced,  constitutional  norm -
and  that  it
operates  as  a  legitimate  tool  of statutory  construction.  More  impor-
tantly,  I contend  that  the  doctrine  is  not  so much  dead  as  relocated.
Its  current  home  can  be  found  not  in  cases  invalidating  open-ended
grants  of  authority,  but  in  the  many  decisions  using  various  "clear
statement"  principles  to  discipline  legislative  and  administrative  ac-

tion.z3  When  courts  require  Congress  to  speak  clearly  in  order  to
authorize  an  agency  to  raise  a  serious  constitutional  problem,  or  to
apply  a statute  extraterritorially  or  retroactively,  they  are  applying  a
narrower  and more targeted version  of the nondelegation  doctrine -
a version that requires  Congress to focus, with particularity,  on certain
especially  sensitive  questions.  By requiring  congressional  rather than
merely  executive  deliberation  on  those  questions,  the  various  "clear
statement"  principles  operate  as  a  nondelegation  doctrine  in  another
guise.  As  such,  the  principles  are  easily  defended,  for  they promote
the key functions  of the nondelegation  doctrine  without  carrying  the
risks of the old and new versions.

My third  goal is to discuss  possible  improvements  in the operation
of  the  Clean  Air  Act,  at  the  legislative,  administrative,  and  judicial
levels,  improvements  that  might  respond  to  various  concerns  about
EPA  performance,  including  the  concerns  expressed  in  American
Trucking. I attempt  to explain how the Act seems based  on the (false)
assumption  that  pollutants  generally  have  "safe  thresholds,"  and how
this  assumption  has  seriously  impaired  both  regulatory  policymaking
and democratic  deliberation.  I also suggest  that the Act should  be in-
terpreted,  or if necessary  amended,  to  allow  and require  EPA  to  en-
gage in  "health-health  tradeoffs"  -
and  also to  take account  of costs
in  setting  national  standards.  In  particular,  I  emphasize  that  EPA
should  engage  in  more  specific  and  quantitative  assessments  of  the
hazardous  effects  of pollution  at various  levels,  so  as  to  increase  the
transparency  of its  decisions.  It  could  even  make  sense  for EPA  to
move  in  the  direction  of  the  "quality-adjusted  life  years"  approach,
designed  to provide  a  concrete  sense  of the benefits  of regulatory  al-
ternatives.2 4  Under such  an  approach,  EPA would  attempt  to  specify
the range of "quality-adjusted  life years"  likely to be  saved by  a regu-
lation,  and it would also indicate the degree  of savings that would jus-
tify  a regulation.  But because  of the harmful side  effects of aggressive
judicial review,  courts should play  only a  secondary  and  catalytic  role
-
embodied in  certain  recent  and quite innovative  procedural  devel-
opments in  administrative  law,  above  all the  "remand  without invali-
dation."  As  we will see,  this  procedural  route is  administrative  law's
newest species  of minimalism,  indeed a form of democracy-promoting
minimalism.2  The  central  point  is  that  EPA  should  undertake  such
inquiries  on its own.

Nondelegation and EPA

This  Article  comes  in six  parts.  Part II deals  with  the  Clean Air
Act  and in  particular  with  the  artificiality  of the  inquiries  that  it ap-
pears  to  make  central  to  EPA's  task.  Part III  explores  the old  non-
delegation  doctrine,  the  development  of the  new nondelegation  doc-
trine,  and  the use  of the  doctrine  in  American  Trucking and  related
cases.  Part IV evaluates the new doctrine, explains  why the Clean Air
Act  is  constitutionally  unproblematic,  and  suggests  an  alternative  ap-
proach.  Part V discusses  the proper approaches  to the Act from Con-
gress, EPA, and reviewing courts.  Part VI is a brief conclusion.

II.  THE CLEAN AIR Acr

Overall,  the  benefits  of the  Clean  Air  Act  since  its  enactment  in  1970
clearly outweigh the costs.

-J.  Clarence Davies and Jan MazurekO

Congress  should  not preclude decisionmakers  from considering  the  eco-
nomic  costs  and  benefits  of  different  policies  in  the  development  of
regulations.

-Kenneth  Arrow et al.V

Most  environmental  initiatives of the  past  seemed  expensive  and  ques-
tionable  at the time,  and today  every  one of them  appears  a  bargain  in
retrospect.  Looking  back  on the  present  a  few  decades  hence,  society
will  consider  every  environmental  program  running now  to have  been  a
bargain, and wish more programs  had been started sooner.

The Key  Provisions

The  Clean Air  Act was  enacted  in  1970.  Though many  hundreds
of  pages  in  length,  some  of  them  mind-numbingly  specific  and  de-
tailed, 9 the Act offers  two remarkably brief provisions  designed  to set
the statutory program in motion.

[Vol. 98:303

The  first  of these  provisions,  and  the  central  focus  here,  involves
national primary  ambient  air  quality  standards.'  Here  EPA  is asked
to  set  standards  "the  attainment  and  maintenance  of  which  in  the
judgment  of  the  Administrator,"  based  on  air  quality  criteria  docu-
ments  "and  allowing  an  adequate  margin  of safety,  are  requisite  to
protect the  public health."31  The  second  of these  provisions  involves
national secondary  ambient  air  quality standards, which EPA must  set
at  levels  "requisite  to  protect  the  public  welfare  from  any  known  or
anticipated  adverse  effects  associated  with  the  presence  of  such  air
pollutant  in  the  ambient  air."'32  "Welfare"  is  defined  to  include  "ef-
fects  on  soils,  water,  crops,  vegetation,  manmade  materials,  animals,
wildlife,  weather,  visibility,  and  climate,  damage  to  and  deterioration
of property,  and hazards  to  transportation,  as  well  as  effects  on  eco-
nomic values  and on personal comfort and  well-being  .... 
I  For sec-
ondary  standards,  involving  welfare  rather  than  health,  there  is  no
provision for an "adequate  margin of safety."  But the secondary  stan-
dards  are  anticipated to  be more  stringent than  the  primary ones;  no-
tice in particular the  statutory emphasis  on plant and animal life.

These provisions  have  three  especially  noteworthy  features.  First,
they seem  at first glance  not to contemplate  any  consideration  of cost
in  the  standard-setting  process.' 
Primary  standards  are  based  on
health,  apparently  to  be  assessed  in  a  cost  vacuum,  while  secondary
standards  are based on welfare, also apparently  to be assessed without
regard to  cost.  This  is not at all  an inevitable  reading  of the  relevant
provisions;  perhaps  the  level  "requisite  to  protect  the  public  health"
and "welfare"  is a function  of cost,  not only benefit; but the prevailing
interpretation  is  otherwise.35  Second,  the standards  are  fully  national
-
even though political judgments about air quality  vary  greatly from
state  to  state, and even  though the effects  of improved  air quality  (on
the  cost  and  benefit  sides)  are  highly  variable  from  one state  to  an-
other.  Finally, both provisions  appear  to contemplate  the  existence  of
"safe  thresholds."  The basic idea is that EPA should ensure  that air is
"safe"  and that public welfare is "protected."

What makes this  last idea  distinctive  is its artificiality.  To be sure,
we  could imagine  pollutants  for which the  evidence  indicated  a point

of "no  risk"  or  "de  minimis  risk."  At least in  theory; it is  possible  to
construct  a dose-response  curve  for which risks effectively  vanish  at a
certain  defined point.  But for most  pollutants,  there  are  diminishing
degrees  of  risk,  associated  with  diminishing  degrees  of  pollution. 6
"Safety"  is  not an  off-on switch;  it is  a  matter  of degree.  When  it  is
said  that  a  certain  level of pollution  is  "safe,"  what is  really meant  is
that  the residual risk is  acceptable  or  tolerable - not that there is  no
risk  at all.  Consider, for example,  this commendably  direct testimony
from  the  Chair  of  EPA's  Scientific  Advisory  Committee's  panel  on
ozone  and particulates,  unambiguously  confessing  the  impossible  na-
ture of the task imposed on EPA by the Act:

Based  on information  now  available,  it  appears  that ozone  may  elicit  a
continuum  of biological responses  down  to  background  concentrations.
It is critical to  understand  that a biological  response  does not necessarily
imply  an adverse  health  effect.  Nevertheless,  this  means  that  the para-
digm  of selecting  a  standard  at  the  lowest-observable-effects-level  and
then  providing  an  "'adequate  margin  of safety"'  is not  possible.  It fur-
ther means that risk assessments must play a central role in identifying an
appropriate  level3 7
How  might  we  explain  the  enactment  of provisions  that  seem  at
once  so vague,  rigid, and artificial?  Much  of the answer lies in the dis-
tinctive  political  dynamic  of  environmental  debates  in  the  late  1960s
and  early  1970s,  in which  citizens  wanted  air  to  be  "safe"  and politi-
cians  who  failed  to  respond  were  at  great risk."  We might  even  de-
scribe  the result as "1970s  environmentalism,"  a form of thinking  that
accomplished  a  great  deal  of  good,  by  producing  rapid  decreases  in
pollution  levels,  but  that  also  seems  increasingly  anachronistic,  even
counterproductive.  In the  1970s  in particular,  politicians  would  pro-
ceed at their peril if they asserted  that  "safety"  could be compromised
by  other  goals3 9  At the  same  time, politicians  were  affected  by,  and
doubtless  catered to, the pervasive psychological  urge  for certainty,  as
confirmed  by  evidence  that  people  are  willing  to pay  a great  deal  for
"no risk" and much less for "substantially  less risk."'   Thus, for exam-

ple, people are willing to pay more for a reduction of a risk from 0.1  to
0.0 than  from 0.3  to 0.1.41  The idea that the Clean Air Act would pro-
duce  "safety"  rather  than  "reduced  risk" made  it far  easier to  support
and far harder to challenge.

Undoubtedly  Congress  believed  that it was delegating  to  EPA the
power  to be  reasonable rather  than unreasonable,  and in  any case  the
Act allowed various safeguards  in the event that compliance proved to
be  excessively  costly.42  The most important  safeguard  has consisted  in
a form  of (implicitly  authorized)  civil  disobedience  on the part  of all
relevant  actors,  including  EPA.  The  result  has  been  a  complex  pro-
gram for nonattainment areas43 and a number of illuminating episodes;
thus EPA was simply not prepared to  shut  down automobile traffic  in
Los  Angeles,  a  step that would  have  been necessary  to produce  com-
pliance  with national air quality standards.'

2.  Problems and Puzzles

All  of  these  points  have  created  serious  difficulties  for  EPA  in
practice.  The first problem  has to do  with expense.  For nonthreshold
pollutants,45 it seems both natural and sensible to assess  further reduc-
tions in  terms of their  cost.  If, for  example,  the  expense  of reducing
sulfur dioxide  from 0.3 ppm  to 0.2 ppm is trivial,  then the reduction  is
almost  certainly  worthwhile  (unless  the  dose-response  curve  has  a
most  peculiar  shape  ).  Even  if  there  is  little  direct  evidence  of  ad-
verse human  health  effects  at  0.2 ppm, this  is  likely  to  be  because  of
the  limited  data,  rather  than  because  of  an  absence  of  such  effects.
But matters  look very  different  if the  cost would  run into  the tens  of
billions of dollars.  When benefits  are highly uncertain, it is peculiar  to
say  that  EPA  cannot  consider  cost,  especially  since  health  gains  are
almost inevitable  as permissible exposure levels  decline.47

41.  See Kahneman  & Tversky, supra note 40,  at 268-69.
42.  For an outline, see  Union Electric Co. v. EPA, 427 U.S. 246,266-69 (1976).

44.  See Krier, supra note 11,  at 335-41  (describing EPA's abandonment  of a  1973 plan  to

ration gasoline  in the Los Angeles  area).

45.  These are pollutants that have  some possibility of some  adverse health impact at any

exposure level above zero.

46.  For example,  one that would show no health benefits  from a reduction from 0.3  ppm

to 0.2 ppm, notwithstanding  health benefits from a reduction  from 0.4 ppm  to 0.3 ppm.

47.  As noted  below,  it seems that  cost  considerations were  relevant  to  EPA's  decision
not to reduce  the particulates standard  further than it did, since  some data indicated possibly
significant benefits  from further reductions.  See infra app. tbl.11.

Nondelegation and EPA

In light of this point, some critics have  suggested that some kind of
cost-benefit  balancing  inevitably  occurs  at  EPA.'  At least  publicly,
EPA  denies  this  claim 9  Consider  Administrator  Browner's  sugges-
tion:

Costs  of meeting the standards and related  factors  have never  been con-
sidered  in setting  the national  ambient  air quality  standards  themselves
.... [T]he focus  has been  entirely on  health, risk,  exposure  and  damage
to  the  environment  .... And  the  American  public  deserves  to  know
whether  the  air in  its  cities and  counties  is  unsafe  or  not; that  question
should  never  be  confused  with  the  separate  issues  of how  long  it  may
take or how much  it may cost to reduce  pollution to  safe levels.  Indeed,
to  allow costs  and related  factors to  influence  the determination  of what
levels protect public health would be to mislead the American public in a
very fundamental  way5
Only insiders know for certain  whether EPA  does in fact consider
costs in issuing national  ambient  air  quality standards 1  But consider,
by way of contrast and as a possible clue, the Administrator's  explana-
tion of the 1979  revision of the ozone standard:

The  Clean  Air  Act,  as  the  Administrator interprets  it, does  not permit
him  to  take  factors  such  as  cost  of attainment  or  attainability  into  ac-
count in  setting the level  of the  standard;  the standard  is  to be  one that
will  adequately  protect  public health  .... [He]  recognizes...  that  con-
trolling  CO to very low levels is a task that can have significant  impact on
economic  and  social activity.  This  recognition  causes  [him]  to  reject as
an  option the  setting of a zero-level  standard  .... However,  it is public
health,  and not economic  impact,  that  must be  the compelling  factor  in
the decision.52

sideration of Cost in Setting National Ambient Air Quality Standards, in To BREATHE

51.  As noted, EPA's failure to require  more stringent regulation of particulates  provides
some  evidence  of cost  consideration.  On  EPA's  own numbers,  more  stringent  regulation
might have provided  $4 billion  in increased benefits.  See  infra app. tbl.11.  If these  benefits
were  possible, why did EPA not require greater  stringency, if not because  of some  cost con-
sciousness?

This  explanation,  difficult  to  follow  though  it is,  is  most  naturally
taken  as  a  suggestion  that  despite  the  nominal  irrelevance  of  cost,
costs  do  matter  in  the  context  of  standard-setting  for  nonthreshold
pollutants.

The  second problem  has  to  do  with  federalism.  The  Act requires
uniform national  standards;  but in practice,  EPA  authorizes  a consid-
erable  amount of variation  among  states.  For example,  there  is little
question  that  the exceedingly  high  costs  of  attainment  will, for  many
states,  produce  frequent  violations  of  national  requirements  -
and
this  has  in fact  turned  out to  be  the case5  Several  decades  after  the
initial  issuance  of  ambient  air  quality  standards  for  ozone,  for  exam-
ple, over 50 million people live in areas  that are frequently  in violation
of national  standards? 4  Smaller numbers  - but still many  millions -
of people live in nonattainment  areas for other pollutants.

The  upshot  is  that  national  standards  have  mostly  served  not  as
real law,  but  as  targets  or  aspirations6  -
flexible  goals  to  which  the
federal  government  can  point  without,  however,  insisting  on  compli-
ance  unless  or  until  it is  reasonable.  This  aspirational  quality  of na-
tional standards  has led Congress  to  enact an increasingly  complex  set
of provisions  for nonattainment  areas, provisions  that  anticipate  com-
pliance  in certain  areas over  a period of many years and that, in  prac-
tice,  therefore  recognize  the existence  of reasonable  variations  across
states.5 7  Indeed  it is  contemplated,  by  the  1990  revision  of  the  Act,
that one of the nation's largest urban areas, Los Angeles, will not be in
compliance  until 2010 at the earliest.5

This  point  leads  to  a  more  general  one,  bearing  on  cost-benefit
balancing  as  well  as  on  federalism.  EPA's  official  position  that
standard-setting  is  cost-blind  is  complemented  by  explicit  statements
to the effect that cost, efficiency,  and feasibility  are relevant in making

choices  about  compliance.5 9  In  a  way  these  statements  are  puzzling,
for  the  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  cost,  and  infeasibility,  are
irrelevant to EPA's decision whether  to approve  state  implementation
plans.'  But  EPA  appears  to  acknowledge  that  state  implementation
plans will themselves  consider costs,  and also that cost will be  relevant
in setting schedules for compliance.61

Finally,  EPA  must  make  hard  choices  about  how  safe  is  safe
enough,  an  important  question in  light of  the  artificiality  of the  idea
that air is either  "safe"  or "unsafe."  EPA's choices  involve not merely
the facts,  but also  evaluative judgments  about  acceptable  degrees  of
risk.  A  central  question  has  to  do  with  the  ingredients  of  any judg-
ment  that a  certain risk  is too  high.  There  are  many  important  ques-
tions here, which include:6'

* The  size of the population  at risk, that is,  whether  100,000,  a mil-
lion, or tens  of millions of people are at risk.63

*The  nature  of the  population  at risk -

for  example,  whether  it
involves  a large  number of children, whether  only  elderly  people
are affected,  whether  those affected  have  a preexisting condition,
such  as  asthma.'  An  important  question  is  whether  any  "lives
saved"  number would  involve young  people  or old people;  there
is less need  for a policy  that would  (say)  increase life  expectancy
by  one  year  for  those  over  80  than  for  a  policy  that  would  in-
crease  life  expectancy  by  sixty  years  for  those  under  10.  This
point  suggests that EPA might reasonably  concern itself not with
lives  saved,  but with  life-years  saved,  a point  to  which I will  re-
turn.6

*The  likelihood  of  harm  for  particular  members  of  the  affected
population,  that  is, whether  the likelihood of incurring  harm is  1
in  1,000,  1 in  10,000,  or  1 in  a  million.'  Thus,  for example,  the
plurality  of the Supreme  Court held in  Industrial Union Depart-

ment  v.  American  Petroleum Institute  ("Benzene  Case")67  that
OSHA  may  regulate  only  "significant  risks,"  and  that  a  risk  of
one in a billion  could not count  as significant.'  OSHA  now  con-
cludes  that a lifetime annual risk of 1.64/1,000 would count  as sig-
nificant. 9  But  undoubtedly  the importance  of  addressing  such  a
risk will depend  on other factors, notably  including the size  of the
affected  population.

o The severity of the risk -

for example, whether  it involves cancer
or  mortality  risks,  or  increased  hospital  admissions,  bronchitis,
respiratory  symptoms,  lost  work  days,  or what  EPA  calls  minor
restricted activity  days."

Although EPA  considers  all  of these  questions  in  issuing national
standards,71 it has  developed  no  clear  guidelines  to  discipline  its judg-
ment about when one or another level of regulation is  appropriate.  It
has  not said,  for example,  that  if 100,000  people  face  a  cancer  risk  of
1/1,000,  regulation  is  presumptively  desirable,  but  if  10,000  face  a
1/1,000  chance  of minor  respiratory problems,  regulation  is presump-
tively not desirable.7 2  A reading  of EPA's voluminous  documents  on
the major air pollutants  provides an enormous amount  of data, but lit-
tle  information  on  the  answers  that  would  trigger  a  decision  to  in-
crease  or decrease regulation.  As we will see, all  of the various  points
noted  above might reasonably  be turned  into  a  kind of global  figure,
for  example  "quality-adjusted  life  years,"  designed  to  quantify  the
various benefits from regulation.73

One  final note:  An obvious  and important question has  to do with
the  distributional effects  of  national  ambient  air  quality  standards.

Nondelegation and EPA

Who bears  the costs?  Who  receives  the benefits?  Full information is
not available.  But an  early  study  finds  that under the Act, poor peo-
ple, and African  Americans,  are net gainers, whereas  wealthy  people,
and whites, are  net losers74  -
perhaps  not a  shocking  finding in  light
of the fact that many of the adverse effects  of air pollution are  concen-
trated in large cities.

In  sum:  The Act has  produced  many  improvements  in  air quality,
but the questions  about federalism,  cost-benefit  analysis,  and  the con-
cept  of "safety"  raise serious  concerns  about  the Act and  about EPA
performance.  As we will see, these criticisms  have implications for the
constitutionality  of the Act  and the  resurgence  of the  nondelegation
doctrine,  as  well  as  for more  general  concerns  of  democracy  and  ac-
countability.

B.  Revising National Standards - and the Tyranny of the Status Quo

In  1971,  EPA issued  six national  standards,  governing  ozone, par-
ticulates,  sulfur  oxides,  nitrogen  oxides,  carbon  monoxide,  and  total
In  1978, EPA issued  a seventh standard,
suspended  particulates IV' 
involving  lead;  it  did  so  as  a result  of  a  court  order.76  These  seven
regulations  amount to the centerpiece  of EPA's regulatory  system for
the control of national ambient  air quality.

Of  course  it would be  extremely  surprising  if the  standards  origi-
nally  adopted  in 1971  and  1978  turn out  to  survive  new scientific  evi-
dence, and  many people have urged  that adjustments  are  desirable,  in
the  direction  of both  tightening  and  loosening  existing  requirements.
Congress has thus created  an "agency-forcing"  mechanism  designed to
require  EPA  reconsideration  of  primary  and  secondary  standards.
Under  the Act,  EPA  is  required  to  review  the  relevant  criteria  and
standards at least once  every  five years,  and to  revise  them "as  appro-
priate"  under  the statutory  guidelines.'  EPA  is  specifically  required
to  consider,  and  to  explain  any  significant  departures  from,  the  rec-
ommendations  of  the  Clean  Air  Scientific  Advisory  Committee
("CASAC"),  an independent committee  established  specifically  in or-
der to advise the Administrators on air quality criteria  and standards.78
A great deal  of time and expense  is necessary  to respond to new scien-

tific information,  thus making the revision  process  extremely  cumber-
some.

So much for the statutory  requirements;  the possibility  of litigation
raises further complexities.  The most  general point is that EPA is vul-
nerable  to  suits  by  those  seeking  more  stringent  controls  and  new
regulations  based  on apparent  evidence  of hazards  at existing  levels.79
If EPA does not act within the statutory  period, or if it decides  not to
impose  more  stringent  controls,  it will  predictably  be  faced  by  a  suit
from  an  environmental  organization  - one  that, in  view of likely sci-
entific  evidence,  has  a nontrivial  chance  of success.'  This is  so  espe-
cially  in  light  of  a  recent judicial  suggestion  that  the  Administrator
may  be  barred  from  declining  "to  establish  a margin  of safety  in  the
face  of documented  adverse health  effects."" x  But EPA is also vulner-
able  to  challenges  by industry  whenever  it tightens a  standard.  Crea-
tive  lawyers  have  a  quite  good  chance  of  successfully  challenging  an
EPA regulation  whether  it has  tightened,  or refused  to  tighten, exist-
ing standards.'

It is  therefore possible  to venture  a prediction:  The  day will even-
tually come  when  the same  court  of appeals  holds  that  EPA  has  be-
haved unlawfully  both for regulating  above a certain level  and  also for
not regulating  below  that level!  The  basic point  is  that the centrality
of  litigation  to  environmental  protection  creates  a  new  form  of  tyr-
anny of the status quo - a great  deal of inertia in favor of the existing
regulatory framework,  whatever its  content.  The general  problem  for
modem administrative  law is that because of the complexity  of the sci-
entific evidence,  skilled  advocates  are highly likely to be able  to find a
serious  problem  in  the  agency's  rationale,  a  factor  that  makes  rule-
making  extremely  cumbersome  and  increasingly  encourages  agencies
to avoid it altogether. 3

C.  The Record

Thus far it might be tempting  to be quite skeptical  of the Act -
to
think  that  it rests  on  false  assumptions,  that  it foolishly  ignores  costs

79.  For  recent evidence,  see, for example,  American Lung Ass'n v.  EPA, 134 F.3d  388

(D.C. Cir. 1998),  and Corrosion Proof Fittings v.  EPA, 947 F.2d 1201  (5th Cir. 1991).

and  state-by-state  variations,  that  it  invites  excessive  litigation,  and
that it is an extremely crude foundation for regulatory policy.  There is
considerable  sense in these skeptical  reactions.  But it must  also be ac-
indeed, that
knowledged  that the Act has  done a great  deal of good -
reductions  in  air  pollution  can  plausibly  be  counted  among  the  sub-
stantial  success  stories  in  regulatory  government  in  the  last  half-
centurya  The  good news  is that  for all  of the pollutants,  there  have
been  large  improvements  in  ambient  air  quality.  Consider  the  fol-
lowing table:s

Even  the  cost-benefit  ratio  appears  to  be  quite  good.  A general
review contains  many criticisms  of American  efforts  at environmental
protection, but concludes  that "the benefits of the Clean Air Act seem
clearly to  outweigh the costs."'  Thus  a study of EPA rulemaking  be-
tween  1990  and  1995 found  that  the costs  outweighed  the  benefits  by
no less than $70 billion.H

On the other hand, better tools could have  produced  similar results
at a far lower  cost.  For example,  there is  evidence  that with  economic
incentives,  EPA could have  achieved  the same benefits  at one-quarter
of the costs.s  There  is also a problem  of poor priority-setting.  EPA's
own  studies  suggest that it  is not  devoting  resources  to  the most  seri-
ous  problems  and indeed that  inadequate  priority-setting  is a  particu-
lar problem  for clean air regulation, where large  problems  (such as in-
door  air  pollution)  receive  relatively  little  attention. 9  An  important

private resources to the most serious environmental  hazards.'

D.  Particulates and Ozone at EPA: A  Case in Point

These  issues are hard to understand  in the abstract; it will be useful
to understand them in light of EPA's recent effort to revise its regula-
tions  governing  particulates  and  ozone.  Notably,  the  origins  of the
new particulates  standards  can be  found  not  in an  independent  deci-
sion by EPA,  but in  a  1993  suit by  the American  Lung  Association,
which  sought to compel EPA to complete its review  of the particulate
matter  ("PM")  standard.9 1  The  district  court ordered  EPA to  issue  a
proposed  rule by November 29, 1996, and a final rule by July 18, 1997.
Here  are  the key  points in  EPA's analysis  and justification,  which
raise recurring  issues  about what  findings  agencies  must make during
standard-setting in the environmental  arena.

1.  The New Standards: Massive Scientific Evidence

The final  rules for particulates  and ozone were  based on a massive
amount  of  evidence,  involving  thousands  of  pages  of  documents. 2
EPA's  public  justification  for  these  standards  is  extremely  long  and
impressively  detailed  but in important respects  vague  and  conclusory.
It  is  filled  with  legalistic  arguments,  with  reports  on  specific  studies
having  ambiguous  implications  for  the  particular  issue  of  what
standard  to  select,  and  with  qualitative  judgments  that  leave  a  great
deal  of uncertainty  about  the  magnitude  of  the  effects.'  To  EPA's
credit,  it  does  not  suggest  that  "safety"  is  an  on-off  switch;  it
acknowledges  that  this  is  a  question  of  degree.9 4  But  EPA  does  not
explain,  in  quantitative  terms,  why  the  level it  chose  is  preferable  to
more stringent or less stringent alternatives.

90.  This is a general  theme of BREYER, supra note 5.  In  a claim  of direct  relevance to
the central claims of this Article, Breyer rejects  the idea of congressional  priority-setting and
makes a plea instead for executive branch oversight of regulatory activity.  See iU. at 90-102.

91.  See American Lung Ass'n v. Browner, 884 F. Supp. 345  (D. Ariz. 1994).  The  district
court presided  over an ambitious  timing  schedule,  one that  was  resisted  by EPA as  exces-
sively ambitious in view of the need to compile and process a great  deal of relevant informa-
tion.

92.  Some  of the  data upon  which EPA relied in making  its conclusions  is held by  third
parties  and  has not  been  released to  the public.  The  nonpublic nature  of this information
raises some problems with  EPA's regulation, because  without access to the data, it is hard to
evaluate some  of EPA's factual claims.

Nondelegation and EPA

A general  review  of the evidence  suggests  that there could well be
both high benefits  and high costs from the new particulates standard. 5
For  the  new  ozone  standard,  both  costs  and  benefits  appear
significantly  lower.95  EPA  offered  a  great  deal  of  detail  about  the
harms  apparently  caused  by  particulates  and ozone  at  existing levels.
It  also  acknowledged  uncertainties  in  the  evidence.  There  are

standard for ozone:

because,  though it is in the middle of the range recommended for  consid-
eration by CASAC and the EPA staff paper, as a policy choice it reflects
the lowest level recommended  by individual CASAC panel members  and
it is  the lowest  level  tested  and shown  to cause  effects  in  controlled  hu-
man-exposure  health studies. 97
EPA ultimately chose a standard  of 15/65 for "fine"  particulates -
more  specifically,  an annual standard, for PM,,  of 15  pg/a,  based  on
three-year  average  of  the  annual  arithmetic  mean  PM,

concentrations;  it also set an hourly standard of 65 pg/m3, based on the

involved  "coarse"  particulates,  PM0.95  There  is  some  dispute  about
the extent to which the  new standards  represent a  significant  increase
in stringency,  because  they  govern particulates  of a  smaller  diameter,
and relative  stringency,  in any  geographic  region, depends  on the size
in  areas
distribution  of  the  particulate  matter  in  that  region; 
dominated  by coarse particulates,  including some  western cities,  there
is  little  increase  in  stringency. 9  EPA  set  a  0.08  ppm  standard  for
ozone  averaged  over an eight-hour  period, replacing  the previous  0.12
ppm standard, averaged  over a one-hour period.

range  of  adverse  health  effects,  including  premature  mortality  and
increased hospital  admissions;  and there is also evidence  that children,
the elderly, and asthmatics  are most vulnerable  to  these effects.  More
particular  evidence  emerges  from quantitative risk  estimates from two
"example  cities,"  estimates  that  include  a  judgment  that  existing
standards  create  residual risks  of "hundreds  of premature  deaths  each
year,  hundreds

EPA's  basic claim  is that  "the  increase  in relative  risk is  small for
the  most  serious  outcomes"  but  "significant  from  an  overall  public
health perspective, because  of the large number of individuals  in sensi-
tive populations that  are exposed to  ambient PM, as well as the signifi-
cance  of  the health  effects  involved." 5  International  evidence,  and
evaluations  by over  1,000 experts,  supported  the view that the  existing
standard  was  insufficiently  protective."  Much  of  EPA's  discussion
involves the fact that existing  evidence  does not  reveal  mechanisms  to
explain  the range of reported adverse  effects.0  And frequently  EPA
repeats what appears to be a key phrase, almost a mantra, to the effect
that  the data "provides  the basis for decisions  on standard  levels  that
would  reduce  risk  sufficiently  to  protect  public  health  with  an  ade-

quality  standards  presents  a  serious  public  health  problem.""1 9  EPA
offers  detailed discussions  of criticisms  of the epidemiological  findings
and offers  what  appear  to be  reasonable  responses.110  As we will  see,
EPA's presentation  of all  the relevant  data  shows  reason for  concern
about  adverse health effects  at current  levels, but leaves  many  doubts
about why EPA chose  the particular standards  it did, rather than stan-
dards somewhat higher or somewhat lower.

2. 

Insufficient Consideration of the Alternatives

To EPA's  credit,  it does  offer  some  discussion  of both  less  strin-
gent  and  more  stringent  alternatives."'  But  the  discussion  is  quite
brief,  especially  considering  the  centrality  of  the  comparative  ques-
tion.  As against the less  stringent possibilities,  EPA says that  "despite
well  recognized  uncertainties,  the  consistency  and  coherence  of  the
epidemiological  evidence  and the seriousness  of the health  effects  re-
quire  a more protective response ..... 
'  As against those who argued
for more  stringent  regulation,  EPA  said  that  "the  inherent  scientific
uncertainties  are too great" and also that such regulation  "might result
in regulatory programs  that  go beyond  those that  are needed to  effec-
tively reduce risks to public health."'' 
Studies  "provide  some sugges-
tion of risks extending  to lower  concentrations,  [but]  they  do not pro-
vide  a  sufficient  basis  for  establishing  a  lower  annual  standard
level.""' 4  Because  this  point  is  so  important,  it  is  worthwhile  noting
that EPA  spoke in  similarly vague  terms  for ozone, saying  that more
stringent regulation would prevent

certain ... effects,  [that]  while judged to be adverse,  are transient and re-
versible .... and the more serious  effects with greater immediate  and po-
tential long-term  impacts  on  health  are  less  certain,  both  as  to  the  per-
centage  of individuals  exposed  to various  concentrations  who  are  likely
to  experience  such  effects  and  as  to  the  long-term  significance  of these
effects. 5
These are  minimally informative  generalities.  Hence  any reader is
likely  to  be  puzzled  about  exactly  why  EPA  chose  the  particular
regulations  it  did -
about  why  it  did  not regulate  either  somewhat
more or somewhat  less.  A special  puzzle  is  why EPA did  not impose

more stringent  controls on particulates; the Regulatory  Impact Analy-
sis 1 6 ("RIA")  shows  that  a more  stringent regulation  could  have pro-
duced  $4  billion  in  increased  health  benefits. 7  The  problem  is  not
that  EPA  was  careless  or  offhand;  its  exhaustive  documentation  was
anything  but that.  The  problem  is  that  in  the  explanation  accompa-
nying  the final rules,  EPA did not attempt  to  quantify  the risks  under
competing  standards,  nor  did  it  show  the  basic  value  judgment  that
would  deem  one risk  too  high,  another  risk  acceptable,  and  another
risk  too  low  (that  is,  below  the  level  requisite  to  protect  the  public
health).

In many ways,  the most informative  document is the RIA.  This is
the most  informative  document because it provides actual numbers  on
the  benefit  (including  nonmonetized  and  monetized  quantities)  and
cost  sides.  It  is  also  a  tribute  to  Executive  Order  12,866,  requiring
cost-benefit  analysis ("CBA")  even when  CBA cannot be  the basis for
decision."'  The problem is that in its justification, EPA made little use
of this  document.  Indeed,  the RIA was written by a separate  group in
North Carolina, and it appears to have  had little or no influence on  the
ultimate  decision.  Some  of  the benefits  calculations  appear  to  have
been  rejected  by EPA itself in  the official justification.  Nonetheless,
the RIA provides  the  only systematic  discussion  of the  consequences
of the approach  chosen  and  of alternative  approaches.  Here  is  some
of what the RIA says:

1.  The new particulates regulation  would prevent 350 annual  mor-
talities;  6,800  cases  of chronic  bronchitis;  1,100  cases  of  acute
bronchitis;  about 1,200  hospital  admissions  from, for example,
congestive  heart  failure  (130)  and  respiratory  episodes  (470);
106,000  lost work  days;  and  879,000  minor  restricted  activity
days.

119

2.  For the selected  ozone standard,  the new  regulation would pre-
vent  0  to  80  deaths,  130  emergency  department  visits  for
asthma,  29,840  acute  respiratory  symptoms,  0  to  530  chronic
bronchitis  cases,  0  to  20  hospital  admissions  for  congestive
heart failure,  0 to 50,440  lost work  days,  0 to 420,300 minor  re-

116.  The  RIA was produced  pursuant to Exec.  Order  No. 12,866,  3  C.F.R.  (1993  com-
pilation) 638 (1993),  reprinted in 5 U.S.C.A. § 601 (1996),  which requires analysis of the  costs
and benefits  of major regulations.  In this case,  the RIA  was produced  by a separate  group
within  EPA,  the  Innovative  Strategies  and  Economics  Group  in  Research  Triangle  Park,
North Carolina.  It is not clear to what  extent the RIA actually reflects  the views  of EPA or
affected the outcome.

stricted activity days.2  (Note that in both cases the  RIA speci-
fies  a  range, which is  a tribute  to candor  in the  midst  of  scien-
tific uncertainty.)

3.  All  these  benefits  are  monetized:  $4.8  million  per  life  saved,
$120,000  per  life-year  saved,  $12,700  per  respiratory  illness,
$16,600  per  congestive  heart  failure  for those  over  65,  $9,000
for  emergency  department  visits  for  asthma,  $260,000  for
chronic  bronchitis,  $83  per  lost  work  day,  $38  per  minor  re-
stricted  activity day.'

4.  For ozone,  the  overall  cost-benefit  analysis"22  shows  benefits  of
$0.4  billion  (low-end  estimate)  to  $2.1  billion  (high-end  esti-
mate),  and  costs  of $1.1  billion.  For particulates,  the  benefits
range from $19  billion to $104  billion, whereas  the costs are an-
ticipated  to  be  $8.6  billion.  A  noteworthy  point  is  that  the
ozone  rule  might  have  negative  net  benefits  of $0.7  billion,  if
the  low-end  estimate  is  correct;  note  also  that  if  the  health
benefits  of  ground-level  ozone  (discussed  below  in  Section
VI.A.5)  are  included  in the calculation,  the negative  net bene-
fits - or more simply net costs - of the rule are higher still.
5.  The RIA also suggests the  costs and benefits  of the  two alterna-
tives.lu  The  more  stringent  particulates  standard  would  have
high-end  benefits  of $108  billion  and  costs  of $9.4  billion;  the
less  stringent  would have  high-end  benefits  of $90  and  costs  of
$5.5  billion. 4  The  less  stringent  ozone  standard  would  have
high-end  benefits  of $1.6  billion  and  costs  of  $0.9  billion;  the
more stringent would have high-end benefits  of $2.9 billion and
costs of $1.4 billion.'

A  serious  gap in the RIA is that it does not give low-end  estimates
for  the  benefits  associated  with  the  alternatives;  only  high-end  esti-
mates  are given  for these.  For the  options  actually  chosen, a  range  is
specified,  which  greatly  assists  assessment  of EPA's  judgment.  But
without the range, it is hard to compare the options not chosen.

An additional  problem, reflected  in EPA's explanation as  a whole,
is the absence  of a detailed assessment -
even a wholly benefits-based
assessment - of why the  options that were  chosen were  deemed  supe-
rior to those  that were not  chosen.  The most noteworthy point here  is
that  by  EPA's  own  accounting,  the  more  stringent  particulates  stan-

dard  could have  produced  $4  billion  in  greater  benefits  (on  the  high-
end  estimate).  This  would  seem  to  count  as  a  substantial  improve-
ment in public  health,  especially  considering  the  fact  that  each  life  is
valued  at $4.8 million; translated  into lives, the more stringent regula-
tion  could prevent  more  than  200  additional  deaths  each  year!  EPA
did  not  square  this  conclusion  with  its  decision  not  to  choose  more
stringent  regulation.  Indeed,  EPA's  own  calculations  showed  that  a
tighter  particulates  standard  would  have  produced  far  greater  health
benefits  than  the  ozone  standard;  this  leaves  a  serious  unexplained
anomaly  in the  two  standards  taken together.126  A  possible  explana-
tion for not tightening  the particulates  standard  is  that  the  consensus
of CASAC  members  did not support doing  so, a  consensus that raises
questions  about  the  RIA  itself;  but  EPA  did  not  offer  a  "benefits
analysis"  that would resolve  these uncertainties.

In  this  light,  what  overall  evaluation  would  be  reasonable? 
If
EPA's  conclusions  are  correct,  the  particulates  regulation  promises
significant  benefits  and the ozone regulation  promises  relatively  small
benefits.  The  basic problem  is that  the  agency  has  not  explained,  in
concrete  terms,  why  it  chose  one  level  of regulation  rather  than  an-
other.  Now let us shift to the nondelegation  issue.

III.  THE PATH OF THE LAW

If we  can just  get our  legislators  to legislate  we'll be able  to understand
their  goals well  enough.  I'm not saying  we  may not  still  end  up  with  a
fair  number of clowns  as representatives,  but at least then  it will  be  be-
cause clowns  are what we  deserve.

tion.' 9  The motivating idea is that Article I, Section 1, vests legislative
power  in the Congress  and that  this vesting  cannot be waived,  even if
Congress and the public want to do so.  If Congress gives the executive
a "blank check,"  or states no  intelligible principle,  it has  violated Arti-
cle I.

According  to the  standard  view, the nondelegation  doctrine  was  a
core  part of the original Constitution,  and its abandonment,  in the af-
termath  of the  New  Deal,  represented  a  kind  of capitulation  to  per-
ceived national  needs."'  I believe  that the Constitution does contain  a
nondelegation  doctrine; but the standard view is much too simple.  For
one thing, there is no express nondelegation  doctrine  in the text of the
Constitution,  which  must  therefore  be  counted  as  ambiguous  on  the
point."'  To  be sure,  legislative  power  is vested  in  Congress,  and it is
reasonable  to  infer  that  the  power  thus  vested  cannot  be  given  to
someone  else.  But there is no  clear textual barrier  to delegations,  and
in  fact there  is  no  explicit  evidence  that  the Framers  and ratifiers  of
the  original  Constitution  believed  that  it  contained  a  nondelegation
doctrine. 12  Actually the early practice  suggested  considerable  willing-
ness  to  "delegate"  authority.  In  the  second  year  of  the  Republic,
Congress  gave  the President  the power  to  grant licenses  to trade with
the Indian tribes  "by  such rules  and  regulations  as  the  President  shall
prescribe."'33  The  first  Congress  provided  for military  pensions  "un-
der  such  regulations  as  the  President  of  the  United  States  may  di-

132.  Consider  in  this  regard  the  treatment  of  the  interpretive  question  in  Ernest
Gellhorn,  Returning to  First Principles, 36  AM.  U.  L.  REV.  345,  347-48  (1987),  which
attempts  to show the  constitutional  roots of the nondelegation  doctrine (a)  by showing  that
John  Locke  believed  in  a  nondelegation  principle,  (b)  by  emphasizing  that  the  Framers
believed  in  Locke's contractarian  view,  and  (c) by referring to  the  Constitution's provision
for lawmaking.  None of this establishes  that the Framers  accepted  a nondelegation  doctrine.
I use this  example because  Gellhorn  is one  of the outstanding  administrative  law scholars  of
the  last thirty  years,  and  also  an enthusiast  for the  nondelegation  doctrine;  his  inability to
show a  direct constitutional  source  for the  doctrine shows that any judgment  on  its behalf is
largely a matter  of inferences.

rect."134  In neither case  did Congress issue  standards by which to limit
the President's  discretion.

The standard view also fits uncomfortably with judicial practice.  It
is often remarked  that the Supreme Court  last used the nondelegation
doctrine  to  invalidate  a  federal statute in  1935.  What  is less  often  re-
marked  is  that the  Court first used the  nondelegation  doctrine  to  in-
validate a federal statute in exactly  the same year.  While  earlier cases
had suggested  the  existence  of  a nondelegation  doctrine,135  the  Court
upheld  a  number  of broad  delegations,"  and hence  for  the  first  138
years  of the nation's existence -
no  Supreme  Court  decision  struck  down  a  statute  on  nondelegation
grounds.

as well as the last sixty-four years  -

Let us briefly explore the two  decisions  of 1935, the nondelegation
doctrine's  only  good  year.  In  Panama Refining  Co.  v.  Ryan, 37  the
Court invalidated  a  section  of  the National  Industrial  Recovery  Act,
saying  that "the  President  is authorized  to  prohibit the transportation
in  interstate  commerce"  of  oil  priced  in  violation  of  state-imposed
production  quotas.3  The Court said that the defect  lay in the absence
of standards specifying  exactly when the President was to exercise  this
power.'39  This is a  controversial  ruling,  fitting poorly with post-World
War II decisions,  and it is most unlikely  that the Court would follow  it
today.  But the largest  decision,  one that  has not been  overruled  even
implicitly,  was A.L.A.  Schechter Poultry Co. v.  United States,140  where
the  Court  invalidated  the  National  Industrial  Recovery  Act  as  a
whole.' 4'  In invalidating  the Act, the  Court made three  critical points.
First, the statutory  standards  were  open-ended  and  self-contradictory
no  constraint  at  all on  government  approval  of  "codes. 1' 42  From

the statutory  language  alone,  it was very hard to  generate  ceilings  and

floors on governmental  action.  Second, the Court said that the Act es-
sentially delegated  public power  to private  groups.143  Congress  could
not legitimately  authorize  private  persons  to  create  law  in  their  pre-
ferred  form.  Because  accountable  officials  did not  "filter"  efforts  at
private  lawmaking,  this  did  not merely raise  the  spectre  of faction,  it
the  co-optation  of  public  power  by  self-
was  the  thing  itself  -
interested private groups.  Third, and in a  discussion of particular  rele-
vance  to  the general  subject here,  the  Court distinguished  other stat-
utes, most notably the Federal Trade Commission  ("FTC") Act, partly
by  reference  to  the  procedural  safeguards  provided by  those  statutes.
"What are  'unfair  methods  of competition'  are thus  to  be determined
in  particular  instances,  upon  evidence,  in  the light  of particular  com-
petitive  conditions  and of what is found to be a specific and substantial
public  interest.  To  make this  possible,  Congress  set up  a special  pro-
cedure."'"  As  we will  see,  the  seeds  of  the new  nondelegation  doc-
trine  can  be  found  in  this  passage,  insofar  as  procedures  are  under-
stood as a surrogate  for clear congressional instructions. 45

In  the  decades  since  Schechter Poultry, however,  nondelegation
challenges  have  been  routinely  repudiated."4 
Indeed,  the  Court  has
upheld  some  apparently  extreme  grants  of authority  to  the  executive
branch.'4 7  But there  have  been  a  few  conflicting  signals.  In  the most
visible  opinion,  Industrial Union Department v.  American Petroleum
Institute,"4  better  known  as the Benzene  Case, the basic  question was
whether  the  Occupational  Safety  and Health  Act  called  for  (a)  cost-
benefit balancing  (as  urged  in a  concurrence  by  Justice Powell),'49  (b)
demonstration that  any regulated  risk be  "significant"  (as  urged in the
plurality  opinion of four Justices,  written by Justice  Stevens),  150 or (c)
agency  action  whenever  there  was  any  risk  at  all  (as  urged  in  a  dis-
senting  opinion  of four Justices,  written by Justice Marshall). 'I  Both
the  plurality  and Justice  Rehnquist  used  the  nondelegation  doctrine,

Then-Justice  Rehnquist  suggested  that  the  Act  should  be  struck
down on nondelegation  grounds."5 2  In his view, Congress had made  no
choice  among  the three  alternatives."'  The  statute  was  therefore  an
unconstitutional  delegation. 
Justice  Rehnquist  contended  that  the
statute was a kind of "mirage,"  in which Congress  "simply  avoid[ed]  a
choice which was both fundamental  for purposes of the statute  and yet
politically  so  divisive  that  the necessary  decision  or  compromise  was
difficult,  if not impossible,  to hammer out in the legislative  forge.""' 4

Justice  Stevens's  plurality  opinion  referred  to  the  nondelegation
doctrine  not to  invalidate  the Act  but as  a  tool  of statutory  construc-
tion.l"' 
In  the  plurality's  view,  the  agency's  position  would  allow  it
such  massive power  over  the private  sector  as to  create  a possibly  un-
constitutional  delegation of power. 6  Partly for this  reason, the  Court
read the statute to require OSHA to show a "significant  risk" before  it
could  undertake  regulation."7  For  the plurality,  then,  the  nondelega-
tion doctrine  operated  as a kind of clear statement principle, requiring
Congress  to  speak unambiguously  if it sought to  give  (what the Court
saw  as)  open-ended  authority  to  administrators.15  Note,  however,
that the  Court left  the  definition of the key  term -
"significant  risk"
-
to  the  agency,  and  that  OSHA  has  yet  to  give  a  rule-like  under-
standing of that highly ambiguous  term.15 9

In the immediate  aftermath  of the Benzene Case, there were occa-
sional lower court suggestions  that the nondelegation  doctrine was "no
longer...  moribund.""  A handful of lower courts cases have  now in-
voked the doctrine.  Thus in Massieu v.  Reno,"  a  district court  struck

158.  There  is much  reason to  question the plurality's analysis.  OSHA did not urge  that
it could do whatever it wanted;  it did not  say that the statute allowed  it to regulate  on what-
ever  terms  it chose.  On  the  contrary,  it  said  whenever  there  was  an  identifiable  risk  to
workers,  the statute  required  OSHA to  regulate to  the point where compliance  was not fea-
sible.  This  is a severe,  even draconian  statute,  not  so  different  from  the  Delaney  Clause,
which  barred  any  carcinogens  in food  color  additives.  See  Federal  Food,  Drug,  and  Cos-
metic Act, 21  U.S.C. § 379e(b)(5)(B)  (1994).  But a  draconian  statute  is not an  open-ended
delegation  of authority.  If Congress told EPA to eliminate any pollutant that causes any  risk
at all,  EPA's discretion would be sharply constrained.  Accord American  Trucking Ass'ns v.

State has reasonable  ground to believe  would have  potentially  serious
adverse  foreign  policy  consequences  for  the United  States  is  deport-
able.""16  On the court's  view, this was  an open-ended  grant  of power,
because  the notion  of "potentially  serious  adverse  foreign  policy  con-
sequences"  could be  construed  in numerous  different  ways,  thus  rais-
ing a risk of arbitrariness.  And  in South Dakota v. Department of Inte-

insofar  as it authorized  the Secretary  of the Interior "in  his discretion,

vations..,  for the purpose of providing land for Indians.' '"" 4  But these

B.  What, If Anything, Is the Nondelegation Doctrine For?

The opinions  of Justice Rehnquist and the plurality in the Benzene
Case have  spurred renewed  interest in the nondelegation  doctrine, and
many have  argued for its revival.6  There has  thus been a spirited  de-
bate  over what  purposes  such  a revival  would  serve,  and  whether,  in
light of those purposes,  a revival would be justified."6

1.  Nondelegation Values

It is possible  to isolate several possible nondelegation  values.  First
and foremost, the doctrine is designed  to promote a  distinctive kind of
accountability  -
the kind of accountability  that  comes from requiring
specific  decisions  from a deliberative  body reflecting the  views of rep-

resentatives  from various states  of the union.  This is hardly to say that
the  executive  branch  lacks  accountability;  of  course  the  President  is
subject  to the  will  of the  people.167  But  the  nondelegation  doctrine
should  be associated less  with accountability  in the  abstract  than with
the particular  constitutional goal of ensuring a deliberative  democracy,
one  that  involves  not  only  accountability  but  also  reflectiveness. ',,
The vesting of lawmaking power  in Congress is designed to ensure  the
combination  of deliberation and accountability that comes from saying
that  government power  cannot be brought  to bear  on individuals  un-
less  diverse  representatives,  from  diverse  places,  have  managed  to
agree on the details.  Consider, as an extreme example,  the  early deci-
sion by the German legislature  to confer on Adolf Hitler  the power  to
rule  by "decree";  this delegation  made  possible  lawmaking  exercises
that would  otherwise  have  been  extremely  cumbersome,  and  hence
removed an important  check on arbitrary rule. 69

A closely related  point has  to do with the extent  to which law, and
particularly national legislation,  can amount to an infringement  on lib-
erty.  If  no law  may  be  brought  to  bear  against  the public  unless  di-
verse members  of  Congress  have  been  able  to  agree  on  a  particular
form  of words,  then perhaps  there  is  an important  safeguard  of free-
dom.  The  underlying  idea  is  that people  may  not  be  subject  to  na-
tional legal constraints unless  and until there has been  specific  legisla-
tive  authorization  for  the  constraints.  This  idea  can  in  turn  be
associated  with  social  contract  theory,  allowing  people  to  maintain
certain private  law  rights unless  there has  been  explicit  authorization
for what would otherwise be a common law wrong. 70

a particular problem in the  aftermath of the New Deal:  Why should  we think that the status
quo embodies  freedom, and that the new law at issue would threaten  to abridge freedom?  It
is far from clear, for example, that the common law system for regulating pollution -
itself a
regulatory  system,  and  anything  but prepolitical  -
should  be  taken  as  an embodiment  of
liberty,  and  that  a  Clean  Air Act  is  a  liberty-threatening  abridgement  of  that  freedom.
Compare  this to the area of discrimination:  Is a law forbidding  discrimination on the basis of
race, sex, or disability  something  that threatens liberty, such that it is crucial  to  obtain legis-
lative agreement on its details, lest liberty be threatened?  Or might the discriminatory  status
quo be the real threat to freedom?  Questions  of this kind seem to me to  raise serious  doubts
about the  idea that a  strictly enforced nondelegation  doctrine would  promote liberty, prop-
erly conceived.  On the  general  topic of status  quo  neutrality,  see  CASS R. SUNSTEIN,  THE
PARTIAL CONSTITUTION  (1993).

Nondelegation and EPA

The nondelegation  doctrine  also promotes  rule-of-law  values.  In-
deed,  the  doctrine  can  be  understood  as  a  kind of  "backdoor"  void-
for-vagueness  doctrine, serving  the same fundamental  goals.' 
It does
this, first, by promoting planning by ordinary  people subject to law, by
giving  them  a  sense  of what  is  permitted  and what  is  forbidden.  It
does  this,  second, by cabining  the  discretionary  authority of  enforce-
ment  officials,  who  might  otherwise  act  abusively  or  capriciously.  In
both of these ways the nondelegation  doctrine  might be seen  as a safe-
guard  against  the Framers'  core  concerns  -
self-interested  represen-
tation  and factional  power.  These  points  can  be  collected  with  the
suggestion  that the nondelegation  doctrine  reflects  the  Constitution's
commitment  to  dual-branch  lawmaking -
a commitment  that  cabins
arbitrary  power,  and  promotes  deliberation  as  well  as  accountability,
by ensuring  that  governmental  authority  can  be  exercised  only when
both the legislature  and the executive have  made  a particular decision
to that effect.

2.  Against the Nondelegation Doctrine

A revival  of the  doctrine  might be  challenged  on several  grounds.
A  large  concern  is  institutional,  involving judicial  competence  rather
than  the doctrine  on its merits.'  The  difference  between  a permissi-
ble and impermissible delegation - between  "legislative"  and "execu-
tive"  conduct -
is  one  of degree,  not one  of kind.  From  what  has
been  said thus far, it should be  clear that the line does not depend  on
anything  qualitative  but on a quantitative issue, the precise amount of
delegated  discretion,  and there  is  no  simple metric  to  tell how  much
discretion is too much.  It is for this reason  that Justice  Scalia,  among
others, has urged that the nondelegation  doctrine is largely unenforce-
able by the federal judiciary, simply because it is not subject  to princi-
pled judicial  application.'73  If understood  in these terms,  the doctrine
might  be  taken  as  a  judicially  underenforced  constitutional  norm  -
but a constitutional  norm nonetheless.

171.  Similarly,  the void-for-vagueness  doctrine  might be  seen as a  backdoor nondelega-
tion doctrine,  requiring a legislature to speak  with clarity.  See Debra  Livingston,  Public Dis-
cretion and the Quality of Life in Public Places:  Courts, Communities, and the New Policing,
97 COLUM.  L. REv. 551,  608-10  (1997).  Both doctrines are also cousins of the plain meaning
rule in statutory construction, see John F. Manning,  Textualism as a Nondelegation Doctrine,
97  COLUM.  L. REv.  673,  719  (1997),  and  are  also  closely  connected  with the project  of de-
mocracy-forcing minimalism, see SUNSTEIN,  supra note 6, at 27.

These  are  largely  institutional  points;  other  objections  cut  deeper
against the  doctrine.  Sometimes  Congress  has  good reasons  to  dele-
gate.  It may  lack relevant  information,  not  only  about pollutants  like
particulates  and  ozone,  but  about  the  social  consequences  of  one  or
another approach  to  regulation.  It may  also be  aware  of the  existence
of rapidly changing  circumstances, which may make  any particular  ap-
proach  increasingly anachronistic.  For a multimember  body, there  are
serious problems  in  achieving  closure  on  any  particular  course  of  ac-
tion, and the result can be to push law in the  direction  of incompletely
specified  abstractions.174  These  points  are  independent  of  the  phe-
nomenon  of  delegating  to  escape  the  political  consequences  of speci-
ficity, a phenomenon  that undoubtedly plays a large role as well. 17

The last point -

about escaping  accountability -
is often  taken  as
a  reason  for  invigorating  the nondelegation  doctrine  in  the  name  of
accountability;176  but  Jerry  Mashaw  has  urged  the  opposite  -
that
administrators  should  be  making  political  decisions,  precisely  on
grounds  of  accountability. 77   As  Mashaw  notes,  agencies  are
themselves  politically  accountable  through  their  relationship  to  the
President. 
Indeed,  public  choice  theory  may  well  suggest  that
Congress  is  more,  not  less,  susceptible  to  factional  power  than
bureaucrats  acting under the  arm of the President.  There is  evidence
that  factional  power  is  most  influential  precisely  when  Congress
legislates with particularity. 7 
In any case  the issue cannot  be resolved
in the abstract.  And it is hard to come up with any a priori reason why
decisions  by  agencies  would  be  worse,  from  the  standpoint  of
promoting social well-being,  than decisions  by Congress.

There is an empirical point here.  It is not clear that from any point
of view, things  have gone systematically  better when  Congress  is  clear
than when  Congress  is  not.179  If we ask  about  promoting  public  wel-

fare,  or  about  agency  competence  and  fair-dealing,  it  appears  unim-
portant to know whether  Congress  has spoken with clarity.  The  Inter-
state  Commerce  Commission,  for  example,  was  one of the  least well-
respected  agencies,  and it operated under open-ended  statutory terms;
the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  is  highly  regarded,  though
its  organic  statute is  similarly  open-ended.  The  Department  of Agri-
culture is  one  of the  least well-regarded  agencies,  and  the statutes  it
administers  are frequently all  too clear.  The Internal Revenue  Service
is  highly  regarded,  at least  by specialists,  and  many  of the provisions
that  it must  enforce  are highly  detailed.  In short:  There  seems  to be
no  link  between  clear  statutory  terms  and  agency  competence  or
agency contribution  to social well-being.

3.  The Centrality of Floors and Ceilings

Thus it might  be  questioned  whether  a  reinvigoration  of the  non-
delegation  doctrine  would  be  a  sensible  response  to  any  of the prob-
lems  and pathologies  of the modem  administrative  state.'"  Indeed it
would  be  foolish  to  suggest  that  such  a  revival  would  ensure  better
regulatory  policy,  or  even  that  it  would  mark  a  significant  improve-
ment in terms  of democratic  values.  There is  no basis  for a revival  of
the nondelegation  doctrine.  But the  doctrine  nonetheless  deserves  to
play a continuing  if modest role in the constitutional regime.

Contrary  to Mashaw's  suggestion, administrators  are often weakly
accountable  to  the  President  (or  the  electorate),  and  in  any  case
Congress  has a distinctive  kind of accountability,  and it is  that kind of
accountability  that  leads  to  its place  as  the institution  entrusted  with
the  making  of  federal  law.  The  Constitution  would  not  tolerate  a
to  enact  such
legislative  grant  of  authority  to  the  President 
environmental  regulations  as  he  deemed  best,  even  though  it  is  not
clear that  such  a grant would  lead  to  inferior  environmental  policies.
The  special  form  of political  accountability  anticipated  by  Article  I,

a necessary counterbalance  to the concentration  of power in the hands  of committees.  In an
era  where public policy  becomes ever  more complex,  the only way  for Congress  to make all
important  policy  decisions internally would  be to concentrate significant  amounts  of author-
ity  in the hands  of powerful  committee  and subcommittee  leaders,  once  again  surrendering
policy  to a narrow subset of its members  .... 
In our view, delegation is a self-regulating  sys-
tem not in  need of closer attention from the judiciary.

EPSTEtN & O'HALLORAN, supra note 166, at 237-38.  The authors add that:

As  it now works,  the system  of delegation  allows  legislators  to play committees  off  against
agencies,  dividing  the  labor  across  the  branches  so  that  no  one  set  of actors  dominates.
Given  this  perspective,  limits  on  delegation  would  not  only  be  unnecessary,  they  would
threaten  the very individual liberties they purport to protect.

IV.  THE NEW NONDELEGATION  DOCTRINE

[E]ven  with  all  its  Frankenstein-like  warts,  knobs,  and  (concededly)
dangers,  the  unconstitutional  delegation  doctrine  is  worth  hewing  from
the ice.

-Antonin  Scalia181

[I]n  our  increasingly  complex  society,  replete  with  ever  changing  and
more  technical  problems,  Congress  simply  cannot  do  its  job  absent  an
ability to delegate power under broad general directives.

-Mistretta  v.  United States1
In  this Part, I discuss  a set  of developments  in  the  modem  law of
"nondelegation."  The  story  begins  with  an  imaginative  essay  by
Kenneth  Culp  Davis,  offering  a  "new"  nondelegation  doctrine  that
would  require  agencies,  not  Congress,  to  come  up  with  binding  con-
straints  on agency discretion.  The  story ends with  a set of judicial de-
velopments  that firmly  embrace  this  idea, by  requiring  agencies  to  in-
terpret  statutes in  a way  that  sharply  narrows  agency  discretion.  To
this  date,  American  Trucking  is  the  culmination  of  these  develop-
ments.

A.  Kenneth Culp Davis's Interesting Innovation

Beginning with an important  essay  in 1969,11  Kenneth  Culp  Davis
proposed  a new  approach  to  the  nondelegation  doctrine.  In its  origi-
nal  form,  he  claimed,  the  doctrine  was  dead,  and  quite  properly  so.
Congress  could not be  expected  to  legislate  specifically,  and  it should
not be asked to do  so.  But much of the doctrine could  be rescued,  and
could perform  a salutary function, if agencies  could be required  to de-
velop protections  against uncontrolled  discretionary  power, and  to ad-
here  to them.  "The key should no longer be statutory words;  it should
be  the protections  the  administrators  in  fact  provide,  irrespective  of

Nondelegation and EPA

what  the  statutes  say  or  fail  to  say."'"  Thus  Davis  urged  "a  much
broader  requirement,  judicially  enforced,  that  as  far  as  is  practicable
administrators  must  structure  their  discretionary  power  through  ap-
propriate  safeguards  and  must  confine  and  guide  their  discretionary
power  through  standards,  principles,  and  rules.'' "u  Davis  thus  pro-
posed  a shift from a  requirement  of statutory clarity to  a  requirement
of  administrative clarity.  In  Davis's  view,  a  central  problem  for  the
regulatory  state  is  excessive  discretion  -
a  system  of  "discretionary
justice."'"M  The  remedy  would  be  to  require  administrators  to  limit
their own room to maneuver.

The  consequence  of  this  requirement  would  be  that  rule-of-law
values  would  operate  at the  agency  level.  This  would  promote  pre-
dictability  and minimize  the arbitrary  exercise  of power.  Synthesizing
a  long period  of work,  Davis  wrote  that  "[t]he  basic  purpose  of the
traditional  non-delegation  doctrine  is  unsatisfactory  and  should  be
changed.  It should no longer be  either to prevent  delegation  of legis-
lative  power  or  to  require  meaningful  statutory  standards."'" 
In
Davis'  view, the

crucial  consideration is not what the statute says but what the administra-
tors  do.  The  safeguards  that count  are the  ones  the  administrators  use,
not the  ones  mentioned  in  the  statute  ....  The  alteration  in  the  non-
delegation  doctrine  in this respect  can be a rather small  one: The  courts
should  continue  their  requirement  of meaningful  standards,  except  that
when  the  legislative  body  fails  to  prescribe  the  required  standards  for
discretionary  action  in particular  cases,  the  administrators  should  be al-
lowed to satisfy the requirement  by prescribing  them within a reasonable
time.'

Davis  was  not  entirely  clear  about  the  legal  source  for  this  pro-
posed requirement.  He  did not  say whether  courts should  act pursu-
ant  to  the  Due  Process  Clause,  Article  I, the  Administrative  Proce-
dure  Act 9  ("APA"),  or  the  common  law. 
In  a  remarkably  short
treatment,  he  said  that  "[p]erhaps  the  non-delegation  doctrine  will
gradually turn into  a facet of due process  ....  But in the longer term,
perhaps  the  constitutional  base  will  give  way  to  a  common-law
base.""g  This was less  than a  decade before the Court's ruling in Ver-

mont  Yankee,19'  the  Erie Railroad of  administrative  procedure,  that
there  is no common law  of administrative  law.  Though  Davis  did not
specify  the source  of his requirement,  he clearly contemplated  judicial
enforcement  of his innovation.

B.  The (Early) Life of an Idea

It  is  not  clear  to  what  extent  subsequent  judicial  developments
were  actually  influenced  by Davis's  suggestion.  But  it is  clear that in
the 1970s,  a number of cases  required administrators  to generate  rules
and criteria, and several such cases  seemed to  adopt an approach  quite
close  to that proposed by Davis."9

In  a  series  of cases,  courts  held  that  an  agency  violated  the  Due
Process  Clause  if it did not generate  criteria  by which to  limit its own
exercise  of  discretion.  Thus,  for  example,  courts  held  that  liquor  li-
censes  could  not be  given  out  without  publicly  articulated  criteria, 93
and that agencies were constitutionally  obliged to say something  about
the grounds  on which they would give out public housing. 94  But by far
the most prominent use  of the idea came  in Judge Leventhal's  opinion
in  the  celebrated  case  upholding  the wage  and  price  freeze  statute,
Amalgamated Meat Cutters v.  Connally.95

The  remarkably  broad  statutory  provision  at  issue  in  that  case
authorized  the  President  "to  issue  such  orders  and regulations  as  he
may  deem  appropriate  to stabilize prices,  rents,  wages,  and  salaries  at
levels  not  less  than  those  prevailing  on  May  25,  1970."196  Thus
Congress  essentially  gave no  guidance  to the President, at least not  in
the text  of the statute.  A key part  of Judge  Leventhal's  response  -
and  a  somewhat  desperate  one  under  the  circumstances  - was  to
suggest  that  there  was  a  requirement  that  the  executive  develop
"subsidiary"  administrative  law,  and  stick  to  it."9  
In  his  words,  a
"feature  that  blunts the 'blank  check'  rhetoric is  the requirement  that
any  action  taken  by  the  Executive  under  the  law,  subsequent  to  the

freeze,  must  be in  accordance  with further  standards  as developed  by
the  Executive."'19  This  requirement  was  said  to  be  "inherent  in  the
Rule  of  Law  and  implicit  in  the  Act."'99   Thus  Judge  Leventhal
emphasized  the  "requirement  of  subsidiary  administrative  policy,
enabling  Congress, the courts and the public to  assess  the Executive's
adherence  to  the  ultimate  legislative  standard  .... 
I"  In  his  view,
"there is  an on-going  requirement  of intelligible  administrative  policy
that  is  corollary  to  and  implementing  of  the  legislature's  ultimate
standard  and objective."''"

There  are  several  points  to  notice  about  this  opinion.  For  those
steeped  in regulatory  policy  - or  from  what  might be  called  a more
contemporary  perspective  -
the  major  constraints  on  the  President
would  come  not  from the  idea  of the Rule  of Law  but from  the par-
ticular context  and background.'  These suggested  that the Act was a
response  to  perceived  "cost-push"  inflation,  that  is,  a  situation  in
which wage  demands  and  price increases  had  created  a kind  of infla-
tionary  spiral,  in which the anticipation  of one would  fuel  an increase
in  the  other.  Whatever  the merits  of this  understanding  of  the  eco-
nomic situation, it suggests a real constraint  on the President's  author-
ity:  He may not favor particular industries  or particular  workers,  and
all  of his  decisions  must be  made  in terms  of the underlying  problem
that  Congress  meant  to  solve.  This  point  suggests  a  much  broader
one,  to which I will return:  An understanding  of particular regulatory
programs,  and  their  public  rationale,  will  often  lead  both courts  and
agencies  to a narrower  understanding  of statutory  terms,  one  that will
sharply  discipline  agency  discretion.  We  might understand  this  as  a
more  modem  approach  to  regulatory  questions,  one  that  diverts  un-
derstanding  from  the  traditional  lawyerly  concern  with  "discretion,"
writ large,  and shifts  the focus  to  a better  understanding  of regulatory
policy.2°  But Judge Leventhal did not take this approach.

In  a  sense,  the approach  that  Judge  Leventhal  chose  has  a  com-
monality  with  Schechter Poultry itself,  where,  it  will  be  recalled,  the

Court  pointed  to procedural  safeguards  in the FTC Act  as  an impor-
tant  distinguishing  featureY 4  Procedural  guarantees  can  be  seen  as  a
check on arbitrary judgment,  operating as  a kind of (partial)  surrogate
for clear  statutory  standards.  The requirement  of subsidiary  adminis-
trative  law  belongs  in  the  same  category  -
finding  surrogate  safe-
guards  in  anything  that  operates  as  a  constraint  on  the uncontrolled
discretion of the administrator.

Notably, Judge  Leventhal invoked  the requirement  of "subsidiary
administrative  law"  to  uphold  a  statute,  not  to  invalidate  agency  ac-
tion.  And in the two decades after Amalgamated Meat Cutters, the de-
cision was  never  understood  to  provide  a tool  by  which  troublesome
delegations might be invalidated.  Indeed,  it can be understood  as part
of  a  range  of  surrogate  safeguards,  operating  in  Davis's  spirit  and
promoting  nondelegation  goals  without  invoking  the  nondelegation
doctrine.'  Thus  much  of the  work  of  the  doctrine,  and  of Davis's
proposal,  ultimately came from judicial review  of agency action  for ar-
bitrariness.  Thus  courts  have  required  extremely  detailed  justifica-
tions for agency rules under the "hard look"  doctrine  and in particular
they  have  required  agencies  to  explain  departures  from  past  prac-
tices.'  The result has been  to require,  on nonconstitutional  grounds,
at  least  some  of what  Davis  proposed:  clear articulation of agency
policy choices, a defense of those choices, and a requirement of adher-
ence to those choices unless there was reason not to adhere to them.  But
as  we will  see,  these requirements  have  been  confounded,  or  proved
inadequate,  in  some  modem  contexts;  and because  of their  unantici-
pated  systemic  effects  on  agency  rulemaking,  they raise  serious  diffi-
culties  of their own.'

Union v.  OSHA.' s  The  case  involved  a  large-scale  regulatory  effort
by  OSHA  to  protect  workers,  with  "lock-outs"  and  informational
"tags,"  from the hazards  of energy  released from industrial machinery.
To simplify  a  complex story,  the regulation  at issue required  employ-
ers  to  place  a  "lock"  on  energy-isolating  devices  connected  to  the
equipment;  or, alternatively, if the equipment could not be locked  or if
another  approach were equally effective,  the employers were required
to  place  a  warning  "tag"  on  the  energy  isolating  device,  saying  that
employees  should not operate the device until the tag is removed.'

The  only  governing  statutory  language  was  remarkably  brief.  It
said that OSHA  should issue regulations  "reasonably  necessary  or ap-
propriate  to  provide  safe  or healthful  employment  and places  of em-
ployment." 10  The  first  question  was  the  meaning  of this  apparently
open-ended  statutory term.  OSHA said that this  language  required it
to  regulate  (a)  any  "significant  risk"  to  (b)  the  point  of "feasibility,"
that is, to the point where compliance  would not be feasible for the in-
dustry,  either  technologically  or  economically2 1 
In  this  way,  OSHA
interpreted  the  "reasonably  necessary  or  appropriate"  language  in  a
way quite similar to  the plurality's  interpretation of the statute  insofar
as  it governed  toxic substances in the Benzene Case.212  Notice  that on
the  agency's  interpretation,  at least  two  ideas  require  a  great  deal  of
interpretive work.  How  do we know whether  a risk is  "significant"  -
what  are  the  ingredients  of  that  inquiry?  And  how  do  we  know
whether  an expenditure is  "feasible"?  Surely  feasibility, like safety,  is
not an off-on  switch.  It is not  as if at  a certain, naturally  identifiable
point, an  expenditure  that had been  feasible for  industry is  no longer
SO.

But the lock-out/tag-out  court did not press these points.  Instead it
said  that  as  the  agency  had  interpreted  the  statute,  the  agency  had
free-wheeling  authority  in  individual cases  to  go from  doing  "nothing
at all" to  "requir[ing]  precautions that take the industry to the verge  of
economic  ruin .... "213  In the court's  view, the statute, so  interpreted,
might  well  violate  the  nondelegation  doctrine.  Hence  the  court
remanded  the case to  the agency in  order to give  it an  opportunity to
adopt an interpretation that would be both  "reasonable  and consistent
with  the  nondelegation  doctrine." '214  The  court,  or  at  least  Judge

Williams, seemed to want the agency to use cost-benefit  analysis  as the
basis  for  decision,215  but  it  did  not  require  that  approach.  What  is
noteworthy  here  is  that  the  court  borrowed  the Amalgamated Meat
Cutters idea,  requiring  agencies  to  discipline  their  own  discretion
through  "subsidiary  administrative  policy,"  so  as  to  hold  an  agency
construction invalid unless it sufficiently limits agency discretion.

On remand,  the  agency  added  to  its  "significant  risk"  and  "feasi-
bility"  constraints  three different points:  (1) the standard must use the
most  cost-effective  protective  measures;  (2)  the  agency  must  publish
an explanation of why any standard  differing  from an existing national
consensus standard would better promote the purposes  of the Act;  and
(3)  the  agency  must  support  its  choice  of  standard  with  record  evi-
dence  and explain any inconsistency with prior agency practice.2 16  The
agency  added  that  when  it identified  any significant  risk, it must  pro-
vide  "a high  degree  of worker protection,"  and would  not be  allowed
to  do  "nothing  at  all. '217  Thus  the  agency  attempted  to  meet  the
court's  challenge  by  suggesting  that  on  any  showing  of  evidence  of
harm, there were  clear  ceilings  and floors  to  discipline  agency  discre-
tion.

With evident  ambivalence,  the  court  concluded  that this was  suffi-
cient  to  satisfy  the nondelegation  doctrine. 218  The  court  said  that  as
construed  by  the  agency,  its statutory  authority  for regulation  in gen-
eral  would  be  quite  close  to  its  authority  for toxic  substances,  which
did not violate the nondelegation  doctrine.219  In both  cases,  an agency
must  choose  a "high  degree  of worker  protection"  once it finds  a "sig-
nificant  risk,"  and it could not regulate  past the point  of "feasibility."
Even though these notions left a high degree of residual discretion,  the
agency was not given a blank  check,  and hence  the statute was  accept-
able  as  construed.  The  question  left  by  the  court's  decision  was
whether  its  invocation  of  the  nondelegation  doctrine  was  a  kind  of
sport,  or whether  it signaled  a broader  development  in  administrative
law.

215.  See  id at  1326.  This  approach  to  OSHA  differs  from  the  American  Trucking
court's approach  to  the  Clean Air Act, which  found cost-benefit  analysis precluded  by the
Act's  explicit  prohibition  of cost  considerations  - EPA can  consider  only  health  benefits.

D.  Particulates and Ozone in Court

EPA's  regulations  involving  particulates  and  ozone  were  chal-
lenged  in  American  Trucking on  a  wide  variety  of  grounds. 2   The
most  ambitious of the challenges, based on Amalgamated Meat Cutters
and International Union, was  a  claim  that  EPA's  construction  of the
Act resulted in an unconstitutional  delegation  of power.  In a remark-
able decision, the court  of appeals  agreed. 1

The  court's  analysis was similar to  that in International Union.  As
the court noted,  "the  only concentration  for ozone  and  PM that is ut-
terly  risk-free,  in the  sense  of direct  health  impacts,  is  zero."''2  The
problem  was therefore  that EPA lacks  "any  determinate  criterion  for
It  has  failed  to  state  intelligibly  how  much  is  too
drawing  lines. 
much." '   To  be sure,  EPA pointed  to  some relevant  considerations:
the  nature  and severity  of the  adverse  health  effects,  the  size  of the
sensitive  population  at risk, and  the  degree  of uncertainties  involved.
The court thought it perfectly sensible to point to these considerations.
The problem is  that they  "do not themselves  speak  to the issue  of de-
gree." 4  On  the  court's view,  "EPA's formulation  of its policy judg-
ment  leaves  it free  to  pick  any  point  between  zero  and  a  hair  below
the concentrations yielding London's Killer Fog. '

With  respect  to  ozone,  EPA  defended  its  shift  from  the  existing
level  of 0.09  to  0.08  on the  ground  that  more  people  are  exposed  to
more serious effects  at 0.09  than at 0 .0 8 .6  But a shift to 0.07 would be
still  more  effective  in  decreasing  exposure  levels,  and  "EPA  never
contradicts  the intuitive proposition, confirmed by  data in its  Staff Pa-
per, that reducing the standard to that level would bring about compa-
rable  changes."'   Hence  EPA's  rationale  pointed  to  no  disciplining
criteria.  To be  sure, EPA said that  a reduction to 0.07 would produce
more  transient  and  reversible  effects,  and  the  more  serious  effects
would be less certain  at that level.  But this "seems  to be nothing more

220.  See  American  Trucking  Ass'ns v.  EPA, 175  F.3d  1027  (D.C.  Cir.  1999)  (per  cu-
riam).  In fact the  court accepted  many  of these challenges.  It held, for example,  that EPA
could not enforce its ozone standards, and that the ozone  standard  was arbitrary  because  the
agency had not adequately justified  its refusal  to consider the health benefits  of ground-level
ozone, which, it is claimed, helps prevent cancer and cataracts.  See id at 1051-53.

than  a statement that  lower  exposure  levels  are associated  with lower
risk to public  health."'  The fact that EPA finds less severe  and more
speculative  effects  at lower  levels  shows  only that "the  agency  rightly
recognizes  that the question is  one of degree, but offers  no intelligible
principle by which to identify a stopping point." 29

In the most ambitious  part of the opinion, the  court said that in or-
der for EPA  to make  rational decisions,  it might  be necessary  to  "as-
sign weights"  to  a "range of ailments  short of death ... ."I The court
referred  with  some  approval  to  apparent  decisions  suggesting  "some
readiness  to  adopt standards  that leave non-zero residual risk,"  as, for
example, by using clinical criteria to decide what  counts "as  an adverse
health  effect."  And likelihood judgments  might draw  "from  other ar-
eas  of  the  law,  such  as  the  familiar  'more  probable  than  not'  crite-
rion." 1  The  court  emphasized  that  "a  one-size-fits-all  criterion  of
probability would make little sense."  Thus,

all the  relevant  variables  seem  to  range  continuously  from  high  to  low:
the  possible effects  of pollutants  vary from  deaths to  trivialities, and  the
size  of the affected  population,  the probability  of an effect, and the asso-
ciated  uncertainty  range from  'large'  numbers  of persons  with point es-
timates  of high probability,  to  small numbers  and vague  ranges  of prob-
2
ability.1
The  court  added:  "Nonetheless,  an  agency  wielding  the  power
over American  life possessed by EPA should be capable  of developing
the rough equivalent  of a generic unit of harm that takes  into account
population  affected, severity and probability." 3  The court  referred in
this  regard  to the  approach  used  by  Oregon  in devising  a  health  plan
for poor people.  Oregon has  used the notion of "quality-adjusted  life
years"  to assess health  gains, and  a similar approach  might  be used to
assess health risks.  Hence  the court held that  the regulations,  as justi-
fied,  were  unlawful.  But it left  undecided  the  question  whether  they
should be vacated,  an issue addressed below.p

American  Trucking  creates  a  genuinely  new  nondelegation  doc-
trine.  The  new doctrine  requires  agencies  to  discipline  their  own  dis-
cretion  through  statutory  interpretation.  The  basic idea  is  that  agen-
cies  must,  on pain  of  constitutional  invalidity,  generate  "floors"  and

"ceilings"  to  limit their own  power; and the space  between floors  and
ceilings  must  not be  too  great.  The implications  of this new idea  are
quite broad.  The new doctrine  could well be applied  not only to EPA
decisions  under the Clean Air Act, but to all EPA decisions,  as well as
decisions  from  OSHA,  the  Federal  Trade  Commission,  the  Federal
Communication  Commission,  the  Consumer  Product  Safety  Commis-
sion,  and  many  more.  At  the  same  time,  the  court  did  not  decide
whether to vacate the regulations, a topic that I take up below.

V.  EVALUATING  THE NEW NONDELEGATION  DOCTRINE

Hard work will be needed  to devise and  secure the adoption of reconsti-
tutive  solutions to  the central  overload  and political irresponsibility  gen-
erated by our prevailing  reliance on  command law.  The  energies  of aca-
demic  lawyers...  should  be  centered  on  this  task,  not  on  supposed
constitutional  solutions that, in the end, can solve nothing.

-Richard  Stewart 35

[T]he  nondelegation  doctrine  should  be  applied  only as  a  second,  per-
haps  last,  resort.  Initial  consideration  should  be  given  to  reading  the
statutory  authority  of the  agencies  and  the President  more  narrowly  if
the language permits.

A.  Is This a Nondelegation Doctrine at All?

1.  The Appeal of the New Doctrine: Surrogate Safeguards

The  new nondelegation  doctrine  has  unquestionable  appeal,  and,
in  one respect,  it has  long  historic  roots.  To  see  why  this  is  so,  con-
sider  the posture  of a  court presented with  a statute that  may  or may
not amount  to  an  unconstitutional  delegation.  If the statute  contains
open-ended terms, but also requires agencies  to act only  after fulfilling
elaborate  procedural  requirements,  the  nondelegation  concern  ap-
pears  to be  diminished.  As emphasized  in Schechter Poultry, the pro-
cedures serve  as surrogate  safeguards.

To  be  sure,  procedural  rights  do  not  ensure  that  Congress  will
make  the fundamental  value judgments; in this  sense they do  not pro-
mote  the key purpose  of the doctrine.  But  if the nondelegation  doc-
trine is designed  to promote  rights of participation and accountability,
then a  right to  be  heard,  and  to  receive  a public  response  to  what  is
said,  can  serve  some  of the goals  of the doctrine.  As  we  have  seen,

Poultry, that  the Federal  Radio  Act  and  the Federal  Trade  Commis-

terms. 37

It is not a terribly  long step from  this idea - of procedures  as  sur-
rogate  safeguards  -
to  the  notion  that  if  administrators  discipline
their own  discretion  through  requirements  laid  down  in  advance,  an
otherwise troubling  delegation  might  be upheld  -
Judge  Leventhal's
suggestion in Amalgamated Meat Cutters. While  constrained  adminis-
trative discretion  does not mean congressional  lawmaking, it does tend
to promote predictability,  consistency,  and visibility  in law,  and  to en-
sure against  ad hoc discretion  by  administrators,  discretion  that might
be  exercised  arbitrarily.  This is the sense in which Amalgamated Meat
Cutters can be seen  as of a piece with Schechter Poultry - with proce-
dures  and  agency  self-constraint  operating,  in  the  former  case,  as  a
kind of "shield"  against nondelegation  doctrine  attack.

The innovation  in International Union and American Trucking is to
treat the notion  of agency self-constraint not as a shield but as  a sword
-
to  suggest  that  if  an  agency  has  not  engaged  in  self-binding  via
clear,  articulable  standards,  the nondelegation  doctrine  has been  vio-
lated.  An  approach  of this  kind  might  well  increase  the  consistency
and intelligibility  of  administrative  policy,  and it  might  make  agency
decisions  more reflective  and  even on  balance  better.  As  a matter  of
policy  analysis,  American  Trucking is  quite  sophisticated,  and  as  we
will  see,  there  is  a  great  deal  to  be  said  for encouraging  EPA  to  at-
tempt  more  refined  and  (to  the  extent  possible)  quantitative  assess-
ments  of severity  of effects,  likelihood  of effects,  and  size  of popula-
tion exposedV38  Such an approach  could well help in the development
of "floors"  and  "ceilings"  for EPA judgment, and  an understanding  of
what  counts  as  the legitimate  "strike zone"  could  be  a substantial  im-
provement in regulatory law.

2.  Problems

There  are, however, serious problems  here.  Taken together, these
problems  amount to decisive  objections to the new nondelegation  doc-
trine.

(a)  Administrative rather than legislative lawmaking.  If  a  statute
creates  a  genuine  nondelegation  problem,  why  would  an  administra-
tive construction  eliminate it?  The fundamental  point of the nondele-
gation  doctrine  is  to  ensure  legislative  rather  than  administrative
judgments  about  the  content  of  federal  law.  It  is  odd  to  say  that  a

Nondelegation and EPA

statute violates the nondelegation  doctrine  because of how it has been
construed by the relevant  agency.  It is  one thing for a court, eager  not
to  overstep  its constitutional  role, to rescue  a statute  from  nondelega-
tion attack by saying  that the  agency has construed  the statute in such
a way  as to reduce risks of arbitrary judgment.  It is another thing for a
court  to  invalidate  a  statute  on  nondelegation  grounds  with  the
thought that  the  agency  has  failed  to  construe  the statute  with  suffi-
cient clarity.  This idea converts the nondelegation  doctrine  into some-
thing else  altogether -
a  general requirement  of administrative  trans-
parency, a requirement with no obvious  constitutional foundation,  and
certainly without foundation  in Article I, the source  of the nondelega-
tion doctrine.

the  lock-out/tag-out  case  -

(b)  Reinterpretation  and  discretion.  Perhaps  the  American
Trucking court's  answer  is  that  an  agency  interpretation  can  confine
administrative  discretion,  and  in  that way,  at least,  promote  some  of
the  purposes  of  the  nondelegation  doctrine,  rooted  in  rule-of-law
values,  including transparency.  But there  is  oddity here  too.  Under
Chevron,2 9  agencies  are  permitted  to  construe  ambiguous  statutory
terms,  and  no  agency  interpretation  is  set in  stone.  Suppose  that  in
International Union -
a  future  OSHA
accepted  the  court's  explicit  invitation  and  decided  that  cost-benefit
analysis  would be  the basis  for regulatory  judgments.  Would  this  be
unlawful?  Surely  not.2 °  And  if  not  -
if  the  agency  is  entitled  to
reinterpret  the  statute  in  its  (reasoned)  discretion  -
then  how,
exactly, does one agency construction avoid a nondelegation  problem?
Perhaps  it does so  because  any  agency construction  makes  the ba-
sis for regulation  visible to  all, and in such  a way as to constrain  agency
choice  unless  and until  a  new interpretation  has  been  issued publicly
and through the required  channels.  But this  seems  to  be  a pale  echo
of the nondelegation  principle.  It is  a  pale  echo, first,  because  it im-
poses no  requirements  on  Congress.  It is a pale  echo,  second, because
it does not bar  agencies,  over time, from construing  open-ended  statu-
tory terms in radically  different ways.241

239.  See  Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources  Defense  Council, Inc., 467 U.S.  837

(1984).

240.  This is  because  the  OSHA  statute  would  permit  this interpretation.  See  Occupa-

tional Safety and Health Act of 1970,29 U.S.C.  § 651  (1994).

241.  In  response  to  the  petition  for  rehearing  en banc,  the  court  of appeals  said  that
Chevron had superceded  the Benzene Case, meaning that the proper response  to  a nondele-
gation  challenge  is  to  obtain  a  narrow  administrative  interpretation  of  the  statute.  See
American Trucking Ass'ns v. EPA, Nos.  97-1440,  97-1441,  1999 WL 979463,  at  *2 (D.C. Cir.
Oct. 29,  1999).  The  argument is ingenious  but not responsive.  If the  statute is susceptible to
a  narrowing  construction,  the  agency should  certainly  provide  that  construction, and  under
Chevron it is entitled  to do  so; but if it has not,  this is the  court's job, so as  to save  the  stat-
ute's validity if this is fairly possible.

(c) Institutional difficulties and very slippery slopes.  There is  also a
serious  problem  for  the  judicial  role.  Judge  Leventhal  used  Davis'
idea  as  a  basis  for  upholding  a  consensual  arrangement  between
Congress  and  the  executive  branch;  the  effort  was  to  find  a  way  to
validate  the  statute  while  also  giving  a  signal  to  the  executive.  The
notion  that  open-ended  statutes  become  unconstitutional  unless
accompanied  by agency specification  would  entail  a far larger judicial
role. 
Indeed,  that  role  would  extend  far  beyond  the  setting  of
regulations  of particulates and ozone.  Consider the following:

*It would  raise  serious  constitutional  doubts  about  most  and per-
haps  all  of  the  rest  of  EPA's  national  primary  and  secondary
standards.  None  of  those  standards  was  issued  with  a  clear
statement  of the criteria  that would mark  the  line between  per-
mitted and prohibited  exposure levels.
* It could well raise questions  about the activities  of other  agencies,
such  as the Federal  Communications  Commission  ("FCC"), that
operate  pursuant  to vague  statutory  terms;  note  that the FCC is
permitted to give out licenses in accordance with  "public interest,
convenience,  and necessity."'242  What  must the FCC say  in  order
to discipline the exercise of its own authority?
* It would  raise constitutional  questions  about  OSHA's  use  of the
"significant  risk"  idea.  We have  seen that  in  the  Benzene  Case,
the Court said that OSHA must show that any risk that it seeks to
regulate  qualifies as "significant."  No  one seems  to think that se-
rious  delegation  issues  are raised  by  the existence  of administra-
tive  discretion to decide when a risk so qualifies,  notwithstanding
the  Supreme  Court  plurality's  anticipation  that  this  judgment
would be made  administratively.  But plainly it would not suffice
for  an agency  simply to announce  that  it deems a  certain  risk  to
be significant.  How can an agency distinguish between  significant
and  insignificant  risks?  Lower  courts  and  OSHA  have  given
some  guidance, but not a great  deal;  under  the American Truck-
ing ruling,  this lack  of statutory  guidance  raises  serious  constitu-
tional problems unless agencies  discipline their own discretion.243

242.  47 U.S.C. § 309(a) (1994).
243.  The  Benzene plurality's  answer  was  a  mix  of the  procedural  and  the  substantive.
On  the  procedural  side,  there  is  a  duty  of  reason-giving;  the  agency  must  explain  in  an
understandable  way  why it deems  a  certain  risk  significant.  See Industrial  Union  Dep't v.
American  Petroleum Inst., 448  U.S. 607, 646 (1980).  With respect to  substance, the  plurality
made a  distinction:  "[I]f the  odds are  one in a  thousand that  regular inhalation  of gasoline
vapors  that  are 2%  benzene  will  be fatal,  a reasonable  person might  well  consider  the  risk
significant and take  appropriate  steps to  decrease  or eliminate  it."  Id at 655.  At the  same
time, the plurality said that a risk of one in a billion,  from drinking a glass of water, could not
reasonably be considered significant.

Apart from recognizing  the fact  that judgments  of significance will  turn on "policy  con-
siderations,"  subsequent  developments  in  the lower  courts  and  in  OSHA  have  left  a high

Nondelegation and EPA

.It  would  raise serious constitutional  problems  about  statutes that
require  agencies  to  engage  in  cost-benefit  balancing,  because
those statutes typically  do not contain  anything  like an  accompa-
nying  theory of valuation.  Two  especially  prominent  statutes  -
the Toxic  Substances  Control  Act2"  and  the Federal  Insecticide,

degree  of vagueness.  To  the extent that  quantitative judgments  have been made, they  take
the form of a  "strike zone"  within which the agency can  operate - a domain that marks out
floors  and  ceilings.  For  example,  OSHA believes  that  a working  lifetime  risk  of  death of
over  1.64/1,000  from  occupational  causes  is  "significant."  See  Building  & Constrs.  Trades
Dep't v. Brock,  838 F.2d  1258,  1265  (D.C. Cir. 1988).  This means that  if a worker  faces a
1.64/1,000 risk of death if he is exposed, for all of his working  life, to  gasoline vapors that are
2%  benzene,  that  worker  is facing  a significant  risk.  The  agency  has expressly  concluded
that the significant risk standard is satisfied by a risk of 1.64 excess mesothelioma  deaths per
thousand.  See id  at 1265.  At the same time, the agency has said that a risk of 0.6 in 100,000
"may be approaching a level  that can be viewed  as  safe,"  Occupational Exposure  to Formal-
dehyde,  52 Fed. Reg. 46,  168,  46,234  (1987),  a  qualified statement  that, in context,  suggests
that a risk of 6 in one million would not be regarded as  significant.  Conclusions of this kind
are  certainly  better  than nothing  at  all, but  they leave  many  open  questions.  What if the
relevant risk  involving  injuries  and illnesses  rather than  fatalities, or  some  combination  of
injuries,  illnesses,  and  fatalities?  Some  version  of  the  "quality-adjusted  life  years"  idea
would seem  necessary  to  allow  meaningful  comparison  of, say,  a  risk of 1/10,000  of death
alongside  a risk of 1/500 of serious respiratory problems.

In addition, OSHA seems to consider the  risk for workers subject to lifetime exposure,  a
number  that seems  vulnerable  for two  reasons.  First, there  are  cases where  lifetime  expo-
sure is rare; what  if, say, only 10%  of the exposed  population is exposed  for all of a working
life, and 50%  is  exposed  for a  period of ten years  or less?  Shouldn't  this be taken into  ac-
count in considering the significance  of the risk?  Second and more fundamentally:  The size
of the  exposed population would seem to matter.  See HAMILTON & VISCUSI,  supra note 63,
at 91-108.  Suppose,  for example,  that  the relevant risk  is 1/1,000,  but that  only 500  people
are  exposed  to  the  risk;  is this the  same  case,  in terms  of significance,  as  one  in  which the
relevant risk is 1/1,000, and 2 million  workers are exposed  to the risk?  Perhaps it is;  perhaps
the agency  believes that no one  should be exposed to  a 1/1,000  risk of death.  This  is not an
entirely  implausible judgment.  Even  so, what if the risk is 6  in one million, but twenty mil-
lion workers are in the  exposed  population?  By hypothesis,  120 workers will  die as a  result
of the hazard.  Is this so clearly insignificant?

The point can be made more vividly by revisiting the  Supreme Court's suggestion  that a
one in one billion  risk of death from  having a risk of chlorinated water "clearly could  not be
considered  significant."  Industrial Union, 448  U.S.  at 655.  Suppose  that  every  American
drinks  five  glasses  of water  a day;  suppose, too,  that  there  are  250  million  Americans.  If
Americans  drink 1.25  billion glasses  of water  each day, then 1.25  Americans will contract a
fatal illness  each day, which is to say that 456 Americans will contract a fatal illness each year
from drinking  water.  Is it so clear that the relevant risk is insignificant?  Or  that a govern-
ment agency  is disabled  from  reaching  that conclusion?  A possible reaction  to these  prob-
lems is that it is  extremely  artificial to  assess the  significance  of a risk  without also assessing
the cost of eliminating it.  If the chlorinated  water risk just discussed  could be eliminated  at a
cost  of $10,000,  it should by  all means  be eliminated;  things  are  different  if the  cost  would
run  to many  billions  of dollars.  But as  construed  by the court, OSHA forbids  cost-benefit
balancing.  Hence the agency must make a risk-only determination.  We can imagine a range
of sensible  judgments  -
for  example,  from  1/1,000  as  a presumptively  significant  risk  to
1/100,000  as a presumptively  insignificant risk  (both rebuttable  depending  on the size  of the
population); or an approach based on quality-adjusted  life years  ("QALYs") -
for example,
considering a savings of over  50 QALYs per year a presumptively  sufficient basis for regula-
tion.  See infra Section VI.A.4 for a discussion of QALYs.

Fungicide,  and Rodenticide  Act245 -
require  the  agency to  regu-
late "unreasonable  risks,"  a term  that clearly  contemplates  some
form  of cost-benefit  balancing.  All  such  statutes  raise  obvious
questions.  Should  a life  be  valued  at  $500,000  or  $10  million?
What  about  a  respiratory  illness?  And  what  is  the  appropriate
discount  rate  for  lives  saved  and  illnesses  averted  (say)  twenty
years from now?'  Congress  has made no  effort to  answer  these
questions.247  Are such measures  unconstitutional  unless  and  until
the agency  has  come  up  with  a  consistent  method  of valuation?
Some  observers have suggested  that cost-benefit balancing  would
be  a  way  to  avoid  the  constitutional  problems  recognized  in
American  Trucking.'  But  under  the  logic  of  the  case,  a  cost-
benefit requirement  unaccompanied  by some  kind of quantifica-
tion  would  be  unconstitutional  unless  and  until an  agency  disci-
plines  itself with  clear  valuation  criteria.  This  would  be  an  ex-
travagant  conclusion.

*It would raise  questions  about much  other  EPA  activity  as well.

Human Lives, 99 COLUM.  L. REv. 941,  943-47  (1999).

247.  Legislative  silence raises  many  questions.  One is  positive:  Why  has Congress  ef-
fectively delegated the  central issues  to the executive  branch?  Part of the answer  lies in  the
incentives  faced  by individual  legislators.  See EPSTEIN & O'HALLORAN,  supra note 166,  at
196-206; Aranson  et al., supra note  166,  at 43-45.  For a member  of Congress,  an insistence
on cost-benefit analysis  is likely  to please relevant constituencies  concerned  about excessive
or irrational  legislation.  But a judgment  about  valuation -
suggesting, for example,  that  a
statistical life is worth $2 million -
is likely  to be exceedingly  controversial,  a kind of recipe
for campaign  advertisements  by  political  opponents. 
In  most  cases,  individual  members
have far more  to lose than to  gain from specificity.  But this is only part  of the explanation.
In a  sense,  people engage  in  cost-benefit analysis  all  the  time; they  decide  whether  to  pur-
chase a Volvo,  or to have a smoke alarm,  or to live in the city,  or to walk  across the street at
night.  But  ordinary people are  highly  resistant  to explicit  cost-benefit  analysis;  they  do not
believe,  for example,  that  they  are  assigning  a  price  to  their child's  (statistical?)  life  when
they decide whether  to put  their child in  the  backseat of the  car.  There  is a kind  of moral
taboo against explicit  cost-benefit analysis, at least with respect to people's lives.  The moral
taboo may be a form  of irrationality;  or it may  be a kind of overgeneralization  of otherwise
sound (or at least salutary)  moral intuitions.  In any case  it should not  be surprising  to find
that law is based on those moral intuitions.  Very predictably, elected officials will sometimes
require cost-benefit balancing, but they will leave questions of valuation  to bureaucrats.

Nondelegation and EPA

(d) Alternatives.  Perhaps it would be necessary  to  consider radical
steps  if there  were  no  alternative  to  the new  nondelegation  doctrine.
But ordinary  judicial  review,  suitably  adapted  to  this  context,  offers
some  promising  approaches,  as we will soon see.  And  in the extreme
cases, the  old nondelegation  doctrine  would  be  the best  route to fol-
low.  In fact International Union was the strongest case within memory
for judicial invalidation  of  a  statute  on nondelegation  grounds.  The
"reasonably  necessary  or  appropriate"  language  offered  almost  no
guidance  at all,  and unlike  in Amalgamated Meat Cutters, there was, in
the  statute's  background,  no  context  that  could  have  disciplined  the
discretion  of  the  agency.  If  the  court  had  sought  to  avoid  constitu-
tional  doubts,  International Union might  have  been  the  occasion,  not
for an invitation to the agency  to choose an interpretation  of its liking,
but for an authoritative judicial interpretation  requiring  OSHA  to  en-
gage  in cost-benefit  balancing.  The  court  might have  so concluded  on
the ground that  "reasonably  necessary or appropriate"  is far more of a
balancing  provision  than  the more  specific  toxic  substance  provision,
and  on  the further  ground  that  an  interpretation  to  this  effect  would
have  had the  advantage  of preventing  the agency from having the dis-
cretion to choose  from one  of a large number of interpretations  of the
Act.  Certainly  this  approach  seems  preferable  to  a  remand  to  the
agency  on nondelegation  grounds.  And  as we will see, judicial  efforts
to require  quantification  -
and
to  elicit relevant  value judgments  could  accomplish  most of the goals
of the new nondelegation  doctrine  without bringing  out constitutional
artillery  at all.

express  identification  of risk levels -

Indeed  there is  a  large  puzzle  at the  heart of American Trucking.
Why didn't the court simply  construe the Act so as to  create floors and
ceilings,  and  then  hold that EPA's  decision  was  not adequately  justi-
fied,  and  therefore  must  be  remanded,  because  of  the  failure  to  ex-
plain why one level  rather than  another  had been  chosen?  The  most
plausible  answer  is  that  the  court sought  not simply  to  invalidate  an
inadequately  explained  regulation, but  to  send the  agency  a  stronger
and more  global  signal, to  the  effect  that  any  regulation  must  be  de-
fended,  on pain  of  constitutional  invalidity,  by  reference  to  a  close,
quantitative explanation of why it is superior to the alternative.  But as
a  constitutional  doctrine, this  seems implausible.  Congress  frequently
asks agencies  to consider  a set of factors.50  Is  agency  action  pursuant

250.  See,  e.g.,  Emergency  Petroleum  Allocation  Act  of  1973,  Pub.  L.  No.  93-159,  §
4(b)(1), 87 Stat. 627,  629-30  (1973)  (omitted pursuant to  15 U.S.C.  § 760(g)  (1994))  (empha-
sizing  that  "to the  maximum  extent practicable,"  the  agency should  "provide  for"  no  fewer
than eight factors, including protection of public health, economic efficiency, maintenance  of
exploration and production  of fuels,  equitable  distribution  of crude  oil  and petroleum prod-
ucts,  and  many  more).  (The  statute  is  discussed  as  typical  in  KENNETH  CuL'  DAvIS  &
RICHARD J. PIERCE,  JR.,  ADMNISTRATVE  LAW TREATISE  § 2.6  (3d  ed.  1994).)  See also,

to  such  statutes  violative  of  the  Constitution  until  the  agency  has
turned  the  factors  into something  like  a  rule?  That would  be  an  im-
plausible  conclusion.

B.  The Place of the Nondelegation Doctrine in Administrative Law

None  of  this  means  that  the  nondelegation  doctrine  deserves  no
place in  administrative  law.  Indeed,  some  of the  arguments  thus  far
suggest a far from trivial role for the doctrine.

1. 

Invalidations in Extreme Cases

In the most extreme  cases,  open-ended  grants  of authority  should
be invalidated.  Schechter Poultry was  rightly decided,  for the statute
did  not  discipline  executive  authority,  and  indeed  it  operated  as  a
grant  of lawmaking  power  to private  groups.  And  it would  not  have
been  at  all  implausible  to  conclude,  in  International Union,  that  if
Congress  is asking  a regulatory agency to  reduce  occupational  risks,  it
should say something other than that  standards should be  "reasonably
necessary  or  appropriate"  to  promote  statutory  goals. 
In  fact  the
OSHA  statute -
outside of the area of toxic  substances, where  Con-
gress  added  relevant detail 5 1 - was  a good candidate  for invalidation
on nondelegation  grounds.

A Supreme  Court  decision  to  this  effect  could  have  some  of  the
salutary effects  of the Lopez" 2 decision in the Commerce  Clause  area,
offering  a  signal  to  Congress  that  it  is  important  to  think with  some
particularity  about  the standards  governing  agency  behavior.  There
should not be many such cases; but  an occasional  signal is highly desir-
able.  It follows  that if the Clean Air Act  did indeed authorize EPA to
"pick  any  point  between  zero  and  a  hair  below...  London's  Killer
Fog,"  the Court would have  been right to  say that  it was invalid.  The
problem was that this was an implausible  construction  of the Act. 3

("CERCLA")  of 1980,  42  U.S.C.  § 9622(f)(4)(A)-(G)  (1994)  (listing  seven  factors  as  basis
for presidential assessment  of whether to provide a covenant not to sue); 42 U.S.C.  § 9651(c)
(providing,  as  guidelines  for  regulations  determining  natural  resource  damages,  that  the
President should "identify  the best available procedures  ...  and shall take into consideration
factors including, but not limited to, replacement  value, use value, and ability  of the  ecosys-
tem to recover").

Nondelegation and EPA

2. 

Statutory Construction

In other cases, the nondelegation  doctrine is  an appropriate  tool of
construction:  As between  an  open-ended  and less open-ended  under-
standing  of  agency  authority,  the  less  open-ended  interpretation
should  be  preferred.  The  most famous  example  is  Kent v.  Dulles,'
where  the Court narrowed  a seemingly broad grant of authority to the
Secretary  of State, thus forbidding  him to  refuse  a passport  to  a mem-
ber of the Communist Party.  As we will shortly  see, the nondelegation
doctrine is part of what justifies a narrowing  construction  of the Clean
Air Act, one that gives  the agency limited room to maneuver~ll

Indeed,  many  statutes  are  sensibly  construed  to  limit  agency  dis-
cretion,  even  if  their  terms  are  broad,  when  the  context  reasonably
suggests  that  the  agency  is  not  permitted  to  do  whatever  it  wishes.
Consider, for example, the Amalgamated Meat Cutters case.  As I have
suggested,  the best  approach  there would have  involved  a recognition
that the statute was  designed  to meet  the perceived  problem  of "cost-
push"  inflation.  Congress  hardly  meant  to  give  the  President  the
authority  to  set wages  and prices  however he  chose.  This  would be  a
truly bizarre reading  of the  statute, taken in context 6  The President
should be  required to justify  any wage  and price  freezes  in  statutorily
relevant terms, a requirement that should go a long way toward allevi-
ating  the underlying  concerns,  which  had to  do  with  political favorit-
ism.  This is the conventional  approach  to the Federal Trade  Commis-
sion Act" 7  (banning  unfair  trade  practicesz8 )  and  (with  a  little  more
difficulty)  to  the  Federal  Communications  Act, 9  whose  key  terms
("public interest,  convenience,  and necessity")  are  not understood  to
allow the FCC to give and deny licenses  on whatever  terms it likes.'

3.  Democracy-Promoting Minimalism: Clear Statement Principles as
Nondelegation Canons

Perhaps  most  important,  the nondelegation  doctrine  is  alive  and
well,  but it  operates  under  another  name:  "clear  statement"  princi-

ples,  or what  we  might  understand  as  "nondelegation  canons,"  occu-
pying the contemporary  position of the old nondelegation  doctrine.26'

Often  courts say that statutes  will not be interpreted  to allow  agen-
cies  to  engage  in certain  conduct unless  there  has  been  a  clear  state-
ment  of  authorization  from  Congress.  For  example,  it  seems  to  be
clear  that  agencies  cannot  apply  statutes  extraterritorially  without  an
express  legislative  decision  to  that  effect,  and  courts  will  not  under-
stand  statutes  to  raise  serious  constitutional  questions  until  Congress
has  made  clear  its intention  to  do  so;  so  too,  statutes  are  not  lightly
taken to preempt state  law.22  These ideas  are best understood  as nar-
rower and more targeted versions  of the nondelegation  doctrine.  Un-
like  the  standard  version  of that  doctrine,  they  do  not  say  that  Con-
gress  must  legislate  clearly;  they  do  not  result  in  the  invalidation  of
any  statute.  But they  do  say  that  agencies  will  not  be  able  to  move
statutes  in certain  contested  directions  on  their  own.  Only  a  deliber-
ate  and specific  decision from  the national legislature  will suffice.  By
requiring  Congress  to  legislate  with  particularity  on  certain  topics,
clear  statement  principles  serve  the  same  function  as  the  nondelega-
tion doctrine.  And they do  so with respect to subjects  that particularly
seem to call for legislative rather than executive judgments.

There  is  a  further  point.  The  nondelegation  canons  require
congressional  lawmaking,  and in  that  sense  they  are  connected  with
Article  I  goals,  but  they  pose  far  less  serious  risks  than  the  old
doctrine.  Where  the  old  doctrine  runs  into  serious  institutional
problems,  partly  because  of the  difficulty  of  drawing  principled  lines
between  too much and too little  delegation, the  nondelegation  canons
are  quite simple to apply.  Because  these canons  do not require  courts
to  decide  hard  questions  of degree,  and apply in  a  restricted  domain,
they  impose  far  less  strain  on  the  judicial  role.  And  where  the  old
doctrine  might  be  criticized  as  a  potential  source  of  danger  to  the
fabric  of  national  institutions  (by,  for  example,  drawing  too  many
statutes into  constitutional  doubt),  the nondelegation  canons  pose no
such  risk.  They  do  not  require  general  clarity  from  Congress;  they
mean  only  that  where  sensitive  rights  or  interests  are  involved,
Congress, rather than agencies, must make the central choices.

It is  especially  striking  that  these  "little"  nondelegation  principles
trump  agency interpretations  of law,  even in  the post-Chevron era, in
which  agencies  receive  a  high  degree  of  law-interpreting  power.263

Nondelegation and EPA

Agency interpretations  of ambiguous  provisions  do  not  prevail in the
face  of a  clear  statement principle,  whose  point is  to  ensure  congres-
sional  rather  than  merely  executive  deliberation  on  the  question  at
hand.  Thus understood,  the  clear  statement principles  are  a paradig-
matic  form  of  "democracy-promoting  minimalism."  They  reflect  a
cautious judicial role, one that does not preempt  democratic  processes
but instead  attempts to  fortify them, by  ensuring  that  certain sensitive
questions  receive  explicit  and  sustained  attention  from  the  national
legislature.

C.  Why  the Clean Air Act Is Constitutional (and What It Means)

All this  helps identify the  basic question that must be  answered  in
order to  decide whether  the Clean  Air Act is  constitutional:  Does the
Act  authorize  EPA  to  set standards  at whatever  level  it wishes?  Or
does it set ceilings  and floors?  If ceilings and floors  are in place,  and if
there is  not too  much  room between  them, then  agency  discretion  is
sufficiently constrained.

In answering  this question, courts  appropriately  do whatever  might
reasonably be  done to  avoid invalidating the Act -
a natural applica-
tion  of  the  general  idea  that  whenever  possible,  statutes  should  be
construed  so  as  to  be  constitutional.'  The  central  issue is  therefore
one of statutory construction.  In fact it is entirely possible  to generate
an  interpretation  of  the  statute  that  survives  constitutional  scrutiny.
The  most  reasonable  interpretation  is  that  EPA's  health-based  judg-
ment  (a)  cannot call for regulation  of small or trivial risks  (such regu-
lation would  not be  "requisite  to  protect the public  health"),  and  (b)
must call for regulation  of risks that  are serious and substantial.  Thus
if the residual  risk  of a pollutant  is  trivial or  de minimis  -
if, for ex-
ample, the risk involves minor respiratory  problems but  no more  than
that -
then EPA is not obligated  or even permitted to regulate  it.  In-
deed,  EPA  regulation  of  a  trivial  or  de  minimis  risk  should  be  held
unlawful,  on the ground  that such regulation is not requisite  to protect
the  public  health,  even  with  an  adequate  margin  of  safety.  If  EPA
seeks to  reduce  exposure  to  ground-level  ozone below  a  level that  al-
ready  ensures  protection  against all serious risks  faced  by Americans,

(D.C. Cir. 1990)  (same).

264.  See, e.g., Kent  v. Dulles, 357  U.S. 116,  129-30  (1958).  For a similar sentiment  from
an enthusiast  for the nondelegation  doctrine,  see  Gellhorn,  supra note 132,  at 352  ("[T]he
nondelegation  doctrine  should  be  applied  only  as  a  second,  perhaps  last,  resort.  Initial
consideration  should  be  given  to  reading  the  statutory  authority  of  the  agencies  and  the
President more narrowly if the language permits.").

HeinOnline  -- 98 Mich. L. Rev. 359 1999-2000

Michigan Law Review

[Vol.  98:303

it  is  acting  unlawfully. 265  On  the  other  hand,  EPA  is  required  (not
merely permitted)  to regulate any substantial or significant risk.  If, for
example,  10,000 people  or 1,000  are  likely to  die each  year  as a  result
of exposure  to a certain  level of lead, EPA must act;  it is  not  author-
ized to allow that level of risk.

These points go  a long way toward  creating floors  and ceilings and
resolving the polar cases.  Suppose, for example,  that existing evidence
shows  significant  increased  mortality  risks  for  ordinary  people  from
sulfur  dioxide  at  levels  above  0.8  ppm, and increased  hospital  admis-
sions at levels about 0.6 ppm, but no mortality risk from sulfur dioxide
levels below 0.7 ppm, and no increase in hospital  admissions below  0.4
ppm - and also that there is chronic plant  injury at 0.1  ppm, and  that
respiratory  problems  increase  among  a  small,  sensitive  subpopulation
at 0.15  ppm.  On the facts  as  stated, EPA's  discretion  is  confined.  It
could  not issue  a primary  standard  above  0.6  ppm or so,  and  it could
not issue  a standard  below  0.5  ppm or  so - unless  it could make  ex-
trapolations  from the  evidence  that would suggest  a substantial  risk at
lower levels.  Of course this is a stylized and  artificial example,  and  of-
ten the evidence  will allow  a range of reasonable judgments.  But that
is a product of the uncertain science, not of any constitutional  defect in
the  statute.  Indeed,  EPA  itself has  asserted  that  on  the  evidence,  it
was statutorily required to set the ozone standard somewhere  between
0.07  ppm  and 0.09  ppm -
a statement  that, if true, is  decisive  on the
nondelegation question.

The  approach  I  am suggesting  - one  that  would  understand  the
Act to create  ceilings  and floors -
raises  several questions  of its own.
It might  be  asked  how  the Act  supports  a  distinction  between  trivial
and  significant  risks;  isn't  this  an  invention  of interpretation,  rather
than a legitimate reading of the Act?  To be sure, the Act does  not ex-
plicitly  make  such a  distinction,  but an  interpretation  to this  effect is
far  from unnatural  and  indeed  a  good deal more  compelling  than  the
plurality's  similar  interpretation  of  the  OSHA  Act  in  the  Benzene
Case.'  Surely such  an interpretation  should  be favored  if it is neces-
sary to prevent the Act from being a blank check to EPA.

265.  Indeed  there  is a reasonable  argument  that this was the  case  for  the  ozone  regula-

tion at issue in American Trucking. See supra Section II.B.

266.  The basic problem for the plurality in that case is that there  was no statutory  source
for  the  "significant  risk"  requirement  in  the  OSHA  Act.  This  was  a  judicial  invention,
designed  to  make  sense  rather  than  nonsense  of  the  law.  See  Industrial  Union  Dep't  v.
American Petroleum  Inst.,  448  U.S.  607,  614-15  (1980).  By  contrast,  the  Clean  Air Act's
requirement of standards  that are  "requisite to  protect  the public health"  and based  on the
underlying scientific  "criteria  document"  is quite naturally  understood  as a requirement that
the  agency  ban  only  serious  risks.  Of course  the  American  Trucking court's  concern  was
"how serious  is  serious?"  -
a  legitimate  question,  but  one  best handled  via  conventional
judicial review, as explained  below in Section VI.B.

HeinOnline  -- 98 Mich. L. Rev. 360 1999-2000

Nondelegation and EPA

It might  also be objected  that this interpretation continues  to allow
EPA  a large  deal  of discretion;  isn't the statute unconstitutional  even
as construed, at least unless and until EPA can give more specificity to
notions  like "substantial"  and "trivial"?  The  answer  is  that  it is  not.
The  most  important  precedent  here  is  the  Benzene  Case itself.  The
OSHA  statute,  as  construed  by  the  Supreme  Court,  requires  the
agency to  regulate  "significant"  risks  to  the point  of "feasibility,"  and
neither  term  is  defined  in  the  statute.  This  does  not  mean  that  the
statute  is  unconstitutional  until  OSHA  particularizes  those  terms.
What  it  does  mean  is  that  any  agency  decision  is  subject  to  invalida-
tion  on grounds  of arbitrariness  if the agency  has  not  adequately  ex-
plained  itself.  The upshot:  This, not delegation, was the fundamental
problem in American Trucking.

My  basic  conclusion  is  that  the nondelegation  doctrine  should  be
used only in the most extreme cases;  that the Clean Air Act is not such
a  case;  that  the doctrine  properly  plays  a  role  as  a  tool  of  statutory
construction,  emphatically  with  the Clean Air Act;  and  that the  work
done by the American Trucking court under the rubric  of the nondele-
gation  doctrine  is  far  more  reasonably  done  under  review  of agency
action  for  arbitrariness.  It  is  now  time  to  turn  to  the  questions  that
remain -
questions  that  are  not constitutional  in  status, but that  are
extremely important nonetheless.

VI.  OPTIoNs,  FUTURES,  AND  CLEAN AIR

[An  agency  wielding  the  power  over  American  life  possessed  by  EPA
should be capable  of developing the rough equivalent  of a  generic unit of

tion,  (c)  devoted  little  attention  to  priority-setting,  and  (d)  seemed

oblivious to tradeoffs. 69  As we have  seen, this approach  accomplished
a great deal.27  But it is far too crude to provide a promising model for
the future.  A new approach - what appears to be a "second  wave"  of
environmental  reform, now in progress - would call for (a)  economic
incentives  as  a  presumptive  substitute  for  command-and-control,  (b)
some  form  of  cost-benefit  balancing,  (c)  attention  to  the  "health-
health  tradeoffs"  sometimes  involved  in  environmental  regulation,
and  (d)  recognition  that  safety  is  a  matter  of degree,  alongside  guid-
ance  for  deciding  when  a  certain  level  of  pollution  is  unacceptably
high.  This is not the place for a full discussion  of such reforms;  but in
the  closing parts  of this  Section,  I outline  the ingredients  of this  "sec-
ond wave"  approach.Y
At  a  minimum  -

and  this  is  my  principal  claim  here  - EPA
should take steps toward greater quantification  of risks associated  with
various  pollution  levels,  and at the  same  time  consider  alternatives  in
some  detail.  A primary  goal  of this  approach  would  be  to produce  a
long  overdue  "common  law"  of  environmental  protection  -
devel-
oped  in the first instance  by EPA and designed  to promote  a measure
of  coherence  and  interregulation  consistency,  and  to  ensure  that
regulations  are not legitimately challenged  as unduly lenient  or unduly
strict.  It is  appropriate  for courts to require  EPA to  do this  as part of
judicial  review  for  arbitrariness.  But  because  judicial  review  itself
threatens  to  have  unfortunate  systemic  effects,  above  all  by  freezing
the  status  quo,  courts  should  continue  current  experiments  with  the
idea of "remand without invalidation."  Thus I suggest that  the appro-
priate approach to  the American Trucking case  would be  a  remand  to
EPA  for  the  required  "benefits  analysis,"  but  a  remand  unaccompa-
nied by invalidation.

art, Reconstitutive Law, 46  MD.  L. REV. 86,97-114  (1986).

270.  See supra Section  II.C.
271.  Still  more  ambitious  reforms  -

perhaps  a  "third  wave,"  now  at its  inception  -

would place  a greater emphasis on negotiated solutions,  on "environmental  contracting,"  see
SUNSTEIN,  supra note 269, at 363,  and  on cooperative  approaches, see NEIL  GUNNINGHAM
&  RICHARD  JOHNSTONE,  REFORMING  WORKPLACE  SAFETY:  SYSTEM  AND  SANCrIONS

tory Theory, 63 GEO.  WASH.  L. REv.  479, 482-503  (1995).  It would  also attempt  to  relieve
the informational  burden on centralized  institutions,  enlisting  private groups in the  determi-
nation of what approaches  make best sense.  See  Charles Sabel et  al., Beyond Backyard En-
vironmentalism, BOSTON REv.,  Oct./Nov. 1999,  at 4,  5.  Efforts  at producing  voluntary  self-
regulation, and provision  of information, would play a central role here.  See GUNNINGHAM
& GRABOSKY,  supra note 5, at 378-448;  Cass R. Sunstein,  Television and the Public Interest,
CAL.  L. REV.  (forthcoming 2000).  Of course  a full  discussion of reforms  of this  sort  would
go well  beyond the  scope of the present discussion.

Nondelegation and EPA

A.  A  Twenty-first Century EPA:  Ceilings, Floors, and
"Benefits Analysis"

1. 

The Problem

I  have  emphasized  that  notwithstanding  its  commendable  detail
about  the  underlying  evidence,  EPA's  explanation  of its  rule  leaves
much to be  desired.  This is not uncommon for agency explanations  in
the  area  of safety  and  health;  similar  problems  can  be  found  in  the
OSHA  context  and also  in  EPA  action  under  other  statutes 27  The
agency's  extensive  discussion  is  abstract  and  conclusory  on  the  key
points.'S  It  does  provide  evidence  that  ozone  and  particulates  can
have  adverse  effects  at  current  levels.  But  it  does  not  give  a  suffi-
ciently  clear  sense  of the  extent  of those  adverse  effects,  nor  does  it
explain why the particular, selected  regulation was  optimally suited to
new  information  about  health  effects.  The  most  informative  docu-
ment  is the  agency's  regulatory  impact  analysis,  which  could  be  used
as  the basis  for a  simple  statement  of the  anticipated  benefits  of  in-
creased regulation at various levels.

The  resulting problems  have  both  technocratic  and  democratic  di-
mensions.  Without  specification  of the  range  of benefits  to  be antici-
pated from various  approaches,  there is a weak role  for sound science
in standard-setting.  The best that  science  can  do  is to  give  a range of
likely  health  and  welfare  gains  from  alternative  initiatives,  and  the
proper role  of technocratic  factors  cannot be  served  if EPA speaks  in
vague,  conclusory,  or wholly qualitative  terms.  What is necessary is to
have  some  sense  of  the  magnitude  of  gains  from  competing  ap-
proaches.  From  the  democratic  point  of view,  what  is  missing  is  an
opportunity  for  the  public,  first, to  have  a  sense  of  those gains,  and
second, to  be  able to  receive  an  account  of why the  government  has
chosen one set of gains rather than  another.  Any particular  choice  re-
flects  an important  social judgment; officials should be  clear about the
values  that underlie  that choice.

272.  See  Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA, 947 F.2d 1201  (1991),  where  the court  rightly
found  a number  of unanswered  objections  to  an agency  rule banning  asbestos -
a  rule that
probably  would  have produced  far more  gain than harm  on balance.  (The agency  reasona-
bly  concluded  that  the rule  would  have  saved  well  over 300  lives per  year  at  a  reasonable
overall  cost.)  The court's decision  eliminated  the asbestos regulation,  a ten-year  effort,  and
seems in  the process to  have  brought EPA's rulemaking  efforts under the Toxic Substances
Control Act  to  a complete halt.  Cf. MASHAW  & HARFST,  supra note  207  (finding  similar
systemic  effects  of judicial  review).  A possible answer  to this problem  would  have  been for
the  court to remand without vacating the rule.  See infra Section VI.B.

2.  Toward Benefits Analysis

By  way  of response,  I suggest  that  in issuing  national  ambient  air
quality  standards, EPA  should endeavor  to  provide  a detailed  "bene-
fits analysis,"  designed to  strengthen both technocratic  and  democratic
forces.  In order  to  improve  the role  of science,  the benefits  analysis
should attempt  to  describe, in both qualitative  and quantitative  terms,
the various  savings  from  the selected  regulation  and  at least two  rea-
sonable alternatives,  one more  stringent,  the other  less  so.  This is  an
effort  to  strengthen  the  role  of  technocratic  forces  by  ensuring  that
EPA is acting pursuant to  a clear understanding  of the health and wel-
fare effects  of reasonable  options.  In the process  EPA should identify
the residual risk left, under alternative  approaches,  by the pollutant  in
question  and  explain  why  that  residual  risk  is  not  above  the  level
"requisite to protect  the public health."  EPA should thus take steps  to
identify the size  of the  population  affected,  the severity  of the various
risks, and the likelihood that members  of any particular group  will suf-
fer  the relevant  effects.  To  the extent  possible,  it should  attempt  to
quantify  each  of these  items. 4  It might  say,  for  example,  that  forty
million people  are  at risk, that  ten million  of these  people  are  under
the  age  of  eighteen,  that  five  million  are  over  the  age  of sixty,  that
there is  a 1/1,000 chance  of cancer as a result of exposure,  and that the
relevant  risks range  from respiratory  problems  to  hospitalization  and
missed work-days  to  cancer. 5

EPA  should  also  explain  why  one set  of savings,  thus  quantified,
justifies  regulation, whereas  other sets of savings  do not.  Here there  is
an inevitable judgment  of value,  and no purely  technocratic  exercise.
EPA might conclude, for example,  that one approach  leaves an  exces-
sive  risk  to  health,  because  it would  result  in  between  500  and  1,500
annual deaths  as compared  with  the  chosen  approach  - whereas  an-
other initiative would go beyond  the level required  to protect the pub-
lic health, because it would  result in between 0  and 100 annual deaths,
most of them involving the  elderly  (and  this a small  extension  of life).
This is  an  effort to  strengthen  democratic  forces  in  regulation, by  en-
suring that  the relevant value judgment  is made publicly  and exposed
to democratic view.

EPA should  also  attempt  to reduce  its own  discretion  by  showing
that  at least  as  a presumption,  risks above  a  certain  level will  not  be

274.  An  argument  against  quantification  is  provided  in  Heinzerling,  supra note  8,  at
2042-69.  Even if we  accept Heinzerling's  argument  against  the form  of monetizing  quantifi-
cation  that is  embodied  in  cost-benefit  analysis,  it is far  from  clear  that  the  argument  has
weight against an attempt to quantify  (rather than to monetize) benefits.  For an argument in
favor of both  qualitative and quantitative presentations,  see Cass R. Sunstein, Cognition and
Cost-BenefitAnalysis, J. LEGAL STUD.  (forthcoming 2000).

tolerated  ("risk  ceilings")  and  that risks  below  a  certain  level will  be
acceptable  ("risk floors").  It should, in  short, explain why  a standard
for ozone  of 0.08  is to  be preferred  to  a  standard  of 0.09  or 0.07,  and

do so by reference  to generalizable  criteria.  If -
risks prevented  by the  new ozone  regulation  are  far smaller  than  the
risks  that  would  be  prevented  by  more  stringent  regulation  of par-
ticulates, EPA should  explain the apparent  anomaly in terms  of statu-
torily  relevant  factors.  A chief  advantage  of this  approach  is  that  it

3.  Difficulties, Uncertainty, Contentious Assumptions

A proposal  of this  kind raises  several  problems.  An obvious  diffi-
culty  is connected  with specifying  the set of alternatives.  Any agency
could "frame"  the alternatives  so as to make its own choice seem plau-
sible, even inevitable.  In the context  of ozone, for example, the  choice
of 0.08 would  have  seemed  entirely  reasonable  if EPA  had compared
that option  to 0.12  (worse on health  grounds)  and 0.04  (regulating  ap-
parently  trivial risks).  Thus  it is necessary  to  ensure  that the  alterna-
that they be within the domain,  or "strike
tives  be reasonable  ones -
zone,"  indicated  by  the  scientific  evidence~m  The  CASAC  recom-
mendations  provide  a great  deal  of help here.  They specify  the range
of  options  that  experts  consider  plausible,  and  if  EPA  compares  its
choice  to  both  more  and  less  stringent  alternatives  within  the  ap-
proximate  domain  suggested  by  CASAC,  the  problem  of  "framing"
should be adequately addressed.

Of course  any analysis of expected benefits will depend  on conten-
tious  assumptions.  The  most  serious  problem  here  is  that  in  many
cases, scientific uncertainty will confound any  attempt to quantify with
precision.  In these circumstances EPA's real question is one of timing:
Does  it  act  now,  or  does  it wait  until  the  scientific  information  pro-
vides  more clarity  with respect  to  health  effects?  Inaction  would cre-
ate potential  problems, possibly  even a significant  number of prevent-
able deaths; but  action could create  problems  too, in the form of high
costs for trivial health benefits.  This  is certainly a plausible  reading  of
the situation  with respect  to  both  particulates  and  (especially)  ozone;
in both cases we do not know enough to assign specific  numbers to dif-
ferent  exposure  levels.  When  existing  evidence  does  not justify  any
particular number, then EPA should do the best that it can  to specify a

reasonable range.'  But scientific uncertainty  is not the only problem.
A projection  of benefits must depend  on  a baseline  about what would
have  happened  without  regulation,  and  (if  converted  into  dollars)
might  also require  use  of the  contingent  valuation  method, for which
estimates  are highly vulnerable to manipulation,  depending  on the na-
ture of the particular  questions  asked. 9  Perhaps most important, the
estimate  of benefits in dollars  will turn partly  on  the discount rate for
future savings;  a  discount rate of 8%  will  produce very different  num-
bers from  a  discount rate  of 2%. 
In these  circumstances,  the  bene-
fits  analysis should be clear  about the assumptions  chosen, and should
indicate  the  range  of benefits  and  the  numbers  that  would  emerge
from different  assumptions.

In terms  of intergovernmental  design, it makes  sense to ensure  that
the analysis  of the rule, and the alternatives  to the rule, are  developed
in conjunction with another institution in the executive branch, such  as
the  Office  of Management  and Budget,  which  already  plays  a  role  of
this  sort under  Executive  Order  12,866.11  The  purpose  of intergov-
ernmental  review  of this  kind would  be  to  ensure  a  form  of internal
"peer review,"  designed  to overcome  possible biases  and errors  on the
part of any particular bureaucracy.  An external  check  is well  suited to
accomplishing  this goal.

4.  An Analogy:  From Health to the Environment

A possible  approach  to  the evaluation  of benefits  comes  from  the
health  field,  where  much  attention  has  focused  on  evaluating  prefer-
ences  for healthy  conditions  (or aversion  to  unhealthy  ones)  in  terms
of what are  called quality-adjusted  life years  ("QALYs").8 z  A QALY
is a measure  of health based  on people's  attitudes toward various  con-
ditions.  It  rejects  the  concept  of monetary  evaluation  of health;  in-
stead, it focuses  on how people value various health  states.  It seeks  to
generate  a means  of comparing  various  states  of health  through  a sin-
gle  metric, so  that  comparisons  and  tradeoffs  can  be made  for  public
policy  purposes.  The  measure  attempts  to  take  into  account  both
quantitative  benefits  of  health  improvement,  such  as  increase  in  life
expectancy,  and more qualitative  improvements,  such as quality-of-life
benefits.

Nondelegation and EPA

The  QALY  approach  works  by  asking  people  through  interview
techniques  to  express  their  strength  of preference  for  various  health
states.  The most  advanced  methods  disaggregate  the process  by  ask-
ing  people  to  describe  how  they  would  value  a  health  improvement
along  several  dimensions:  mobility,  physical  activity,  social  activity,
and  the  kinds  of symptom  effects  involved.' 
The  answers  to  these
questions  are combined  into a  single scale, ranked  0  (for death)  to  1.0
(for optimum  functioning).  The  result is  an index  of utility for health
states  measured  on  an interval  (or cardinal)  scale.  By independently
determining  the cost  of various  treatments  and their likely  outcomes,
researchers  can suggest  a  cost per  QALY  of various public  programs.
Alternative  programs  can  be  ranked  in  what  is  essentially  a  utility-
based  cost-effectiveness  scale. 4

In the context  of the Clean Air Act, it makes  little sense to  engage
in surveys  about how people rank various health risks.  In the govern-
ing  RIA, EPA  has  already  attempted  to  measure  both benefits  and
willingness  to  pay for reductions  of various  risks, 
and it could easily
adapt  these  figures  to  generate  numbers  for  overall  risk  reductions,
defined  in  terms  of some  overall  measure,  perhaps  that  of  quality-
adjusted  life years.  Lives saved  might, for  example, be  converted into
a life-years  saved number, and to this EPA could add various numbers
representing  the other health  gains to be brought  about by the regula-
tion.  The approach  to particulates might be compared to, and squared
with, the  approach  to  ozone,  and these  approaches  might  also  be  ra-
tionalized  with  existing  regulation  of  lead,  sulfur  dioxide,  nitrogen
oxides, and carbon monoxide2 6

5.  Toward a (New) Common Law of Regulatory Protection

Through  such  a route EPA  could begin  to  develop  what  it should
have  provided  at least  a decade  ago:  a  common  law  of public  health
protection.  This would reflect  a system  of judgments  indicating  when

283.  An  important  work  in  the  development  of  these  multidimensional  measures  is

Evaluation Research and Policy Analysis, 1 HEALTH PSYcH. 61,  68-69  (1982).  For a  general
survey of QALY approaches, see  George W. Torrance,  Measurement of Health State  Utilities
for Economic Appraisak A Review, 5 J. HEALTH ECON.  1 (1986).  For a more  recent general
discussion,  see  Robert  Fabian,  The  Qualy Approach, in  VALUING  HEALTH  FOR POLICY:
AN ECONOMIC APPROACH 118  (George Tolley et al.  eds., 1994).

284.  An important advantage  of the  QALY method is that it eliminates the distribution-
of-income  problems  of other  methods.  The  QALY  approach  rests  on  a  strict egalitarian
premise;  the  value of various  states of health should be independent of the  economic status
of the particular people in those states.

a given  set of harms  is  sufficient to trigger  additional  regulation,  and
also when a set  of harms is  too trivial to count  as  a legally  cognizable
public  health problem.  And eventually  it should  be  possible to  have
quite  disaggregated  data,  showing  the  geographical  areas  in  which
health  problems  are most concentrated.  For example, the health  risks
of lead were  concentrated  in  the inner  city;-. 
the  same  may  well  be
true  of particulates.  If  this  is  so,  a  careful  "benefits  analysis"  could
pave  the  way  toward  an  understanding  of  where  regulatory  activity
would  accomplish  the most good,  in a  way  that would  diminish some
of the problems  associated  with  a nationally  uniform policy.  Such an
approach  could  also  help  to  invigorate  local  processes  for  environ-
mental protection,  so as  to allow  a  higher  degree  of coordination  be-
tween the national government  and states and localities.M

This final point raises  a  general  question about the  content of any
such  common law:  the status, for purposes of law and policy, of inter-
regulation inconsistency.  Suppose,  for  example,  that  EPA  leaves  a
much higher  residual risk  for particulates  than for ozone,  as indeed it
plainly appears  to have  done  here. 9  Is  this indefensible,  or even  un-
lawful?  As we have  seen, one of the virtues of the  approach suggested
here is that it attempts to promote consistency  in the rulemaking  proc-
ess,  in  such  a  way  as  to  reduce  the  power  of  well-organized  private
groups.  It might seem to follow that if EPA allows  a much higher re-
sidual risk  for one substance  than for another, it should be vulnerable
on judicial review;  and so too if it allows a much lower residual risk for
a  particular  pollutant.  This  does  indeed  follow.  The  question  is
whether  EPA  can  defend  apparent  interregulation  inconsistency  in
statutorily  relevant  terms  (as,  for  example,  by  showing  that  children
are at particular risk from one or another problem).  If it cannot, it has
acted unlawfully.

There is  a still broader point in the background  here.  The case for
clear standards  is strongest in a  "mass justice"  situation - a context  in
which an agency must decide a wide range of cases.  In such situations,
standardlessness  is  unacceptable  -
it creates  a  recipe  for abuse,  pro-
ducing unequal treatment of the similarly situated.290  When an agency
is making a one-shot  decision,  or two or three decisions,  the  argument
for binding standards  is less insistent.  The point helps  explain  the  de-
cision of the court of appeals in American Trucking, where two regula-
tions  were  before  the  court,  not easily  reconciled  with  one  another,
and  where  many  years  of NAAQS  decisions  made  the  situation  re-

semble more closely a "mass justice"  problem.  In these circumstances,
the proposal  for "benefits  analysis"  is designed  to  ensure a  set of rela-
tively uniform  and transparent  standards, more  suitable  to  the  future
of environmental  protection, where  the  whole  area will  achieve  a  de-
gree  of maturity.  The  development  of  a  common  law  of regulatory
protection,  generated  in  the  first  instance  by  agencies  rather  than
judges, would be a crucial step in this endeavor.

B.  Ordinary (Not Extraordinary) Judicial Review:  Democracy-
Promoting Minimalism in Practice

As  I  have  suggested,  conventional  judicial  review  could  have  ac-
commodated  the  American  Trucking court's  reasonable  concerns." 1
In  order  to  explore  how  democracy-promoting  minimalism  might
work,  I suggest here  that the  appropriate  approach  would be  to  hold
both  regulations  invalid  on the  ground  that the  agency  did not  ade-
quately  explain  its  choice  of  the  particular  levels  that  it  prescribed.
The most serious problem with this approach  is that it threatens  exces-
sive judicial entanglement  with the rulemaking  process,  in a  way  that
would likely have  unfortunate  systemic effects, in the form of a power-
ful  bias  toward  protecting  the status  quo.  The  best  response  to  this
concern is  to  choose  one of the two  recent innovations  in judicial  re-
view  of administrative  action:  allowing  the agency to  issue an interim
rule, or (better still) remanding the regulations without vacating them.

1.  Failing the Hard Look

A  quite  standard  opinion  would  have  invalidated  the  agency's
rules  on the  ground  that there  was an  insufficiently  clear explanation
of the key policy  decisions.  On this view, the problem was  not one  of
delegation, but of a lack of clarity  about why lines were drawn  exactly
where  EPA  drew  them.  Why  did EPA  choose  0.08  ppm rather  than
0.07  ppm,  or 0.06  ppm?  The  difficulty  of answering  that  question  in
concrete  terms would have justified  a remand to the agency.

This  approach  might be  generalized.  It  could apply,  for  example,
to  a  judgment  of  OSHA  that  a  regulation  is  necessary  to  address  a
"significant  risk,"  or to  an  administrative  decision  to  proceed  against
an "unreasonable  risk."  In  such  cases,  courts might require  agencies
to  quantify  the problem  that  they  are  attempting  to  reduce,  and  ex-
plain  why  they chose  the  approach  at issue  rather than  one  more  or
less  stringent.  A simple requirement  of this kind might strengthen the
hand of technocratic  and policy-analytic  forces in the regulatory state,

291.  See supra Section V.B.

HeinOnline  -- 98 Mich. L. Rev. 369 1999-2000

Michigan Law Review

[Vol.  98:303

thus  weakening  the  hand  of  self-interested  private  groups;  it  might
also promote transparency  about the relevant value judgments.

2.  Surviving a Softer Look

Another  type  of  conventional  opinion,  more  deferential  to  the
agency and also reasonable, might have  upheld both the ozone and the
PM standards,  on  the ground that neither had  been shown  to  be  arbi-
trary  or  capricious  -
the  agency  sufficiently  explained  why  the  risk
was less  severe below the standard it set, and also why the risk was too
severe  at any  point  above  that  standard.  The  agency  did  show  that
significant risks could be  expected,  especially  from particulates,  where
thousands  of people,  on  a  reasonable  view  of  the  evidence,  were  at
risk  each  year.  To  be  sure,  significant  challenges  were  made  to  the
science  underlying  both  decisions.  But  the record contained  substan-
tial support for EPA's particular  choices -
at least enough  support  to
satisfy a court engaged in the ordinary scrutiny of EPA decisions.

This  approach  might  also  be  generalized.  For  example,  a  court
might uphold OSHA  action  so long as the  agency has explained  why  a
particular risk is significant  and explained,  at least in broad  terms, why
it did not select  a more or less stringent alternative.

3.  The Problem of Ossification and the Tyranny of the
Status Quo Revisited

Both of these  opinions  would  have been  entirely  responsible,  and
the choice  between them,  both  for the case at hand  and  for future  ap-
proaches to judicial review, is not easy.  Ultimately  I conclude  that the
first is preferable  in the context  of American  Trucking.  If the  second
is to be preferred,  it is not because EPA was  doing  its job well, but  for
reasons that go to institutional  competence  and that involve the  harm-
ful systemic effects  of the seemingly innocuous,  one-shot remand.

With  respect  to  institutional  competence:  EPA  is  of  course  ac-
countable  to the President, and environmental  issues tend to be highly
visible  and  well  ventilated  publicly  -
as  well  ventilated,  perhaps,  as
any other issue of regulatory policy.  Certainly the PM and ozone  rules
were  subject  to  a  high  degree  of public  scrutiny.  At the  same  time,
these  are  technically  complex  questions  on  which  EPA  has  a  strong
comparative  advantage  over the judiciary.  If there  is a  clear blunder,
or a judgment that does not depend on either  a reasonable  assessment
of the  scientific  evidence  or  (where  the  evidence  leaves  gaps)  a  rea-
sonable  and  articulated judgment of value, of course  the  court  should
interfere.  But otherwise it should not.

Nondelegation and EPA

With  respect  to  systematic  effects:  A  great  deal  of attention  has
been  paid  to  the  phenomenon  of  the  "ossification"  of  notice-and-
comment  rulemaking, 
and  indeed  a  high  priority,  for  the future  of
administrative  law,  is  to  devise  means  to  overcome  the  problem.
Originally  intended  as a  quick and effective  alternative to  formal,  on-
the-record  rulemaking,  executive  and  especially  judicial  innovations
have  converted  notice-and-comment  rulemaking into  an exceptionally
time-consuming  affair, often consuming  many  years,  frequently half  a
decade  and  more.  In  fact  EPA  estimates  that  informal  rulemaking
typically takes five years? 9H  Consider, for example, the fact that EPA's
only  rulemaking  under  the Toxic  Substances  Control  Act,  involving
asbestos,  cost millions  of dollars  and took  over  a  decade  to  complete
and that  the  rule  that  emerged  was  eventually  struck  down  as  in-
-
adequately  justified 94  Aggressive judicial review  contributes  to  these
delays,  and  when  the  result  is  to  remand  a  rule,  the ultimate  conse-
quence  can be  to discourage  rulemaking  altogether.  For example,  the
impressive  study  of  Mashaw  and  Harfst  shows  that  the  National
Highway  Traffic Safety Administration  ("NHTSA")  has come  close to
abandoning  rulemaking,  largely  because  of the  problems  introduced
by  "hard look" judicial review 95  Instead  of rulemaking, NHTSA  acts
largely  through  after-the-fact  recalls,  to  which  courts  are  far  more
sympathetic.  It is  far from  clear  that American  drivers  are better  off
with this shift.  Nor is this an isolated  example.  Something  similar ap-
pears  to  have  happened  with the  Consumer  Product  Safety  Commis-
sion,  and  EPA  seems  to  have  abandoned  enforcement  of  the  Toxic
Substances  Control Act, largely  as a  result of intense  judicial scrutiny
of EPA activity.2

Now we cannot  conclude  that  a certain judicial  role is  inappropri-
ate simply because it leads to  agency inactivity.  Perhaps it is good for
exactly  that  reason.  The  problem  is  when  strict judicial  supervision
has  the effect  of freezing  the status  quo, whatever  the status quo  hap-
pens to be.  This is an unintended  systemic  effect  of hard look review.
Particular judges, reviewing  particular rules, can  be made alert to  par-
ticular problems  in those  rules,  especially when  the rules are under  at-
tack  by  experienced,  inventive  lawyers.  For some  rules,  it is  easy  to
imagine  seemingly  decisive  objections  from both sides -

terest lawyers show, quite convincingly, why a certain rule should have
been made more stringent,  and as  industry lawyers  show, with respect
to the same  rule, why  greater  leniency  was legally  mandated.  Nor  is
this fanciful; something of this kind has happened  on several occasions
in the "hard look"  era.29

There  is  no simple  cure for the problem,  especially  in  light of evi-
dence  that  hard  look  review  has  often  accomplished  considerable
good.  But it makes  sense to say that in the absence  of a violation  of a
statute,  courts  should  not  invalidate  regulations  unless  the  objection
goes  to the heart of the agency's  conclusions  - unless  there has  been
a  quite serious  error  of analysis, or there  is good reason  to think that
the rule will make things worse rather than better in light of statutorily
relevant criteria.  Of course  advice of this sort will not  decide concrete
questions.  But it  suggests  serious  problems  with  the  invalidation  of
EPA's ozone and particulates regulations.

4.  Procedural Innovations: Administrative Law Minimalism

Thus far  a  court  might  seem to  be in  equipoise  between  two  rea-
sonable  alternatives: 
a  decision  to  uphold  the  regulations  on  the
grounds  just  stated,  and  a  decision  to invalidate  them  on  the  theory
that the agency  offered  no  clear  explanation  of the particular level  it
chose.  The choice between  the alternatives  might  turn on assessment
of the systemic  effects of one or another course.  The danger  of invali-
dation is that it could greatly delay this  or any other EPA rulemaking,
in  a way  that would  cause  a powerful  status  quo  bias, one  that could
not be defended.  The danger of validation  is that it would allow  EPA
rules  that have not been persuasively  defended  and that might do  less
good than harm.

But  two recent  procedural  innovations  help  resolve  the  dilemma,
and  point the way  to a  sensible resolution  of the American Trucking
case.  Courts of appeals now  appear  prepared  to  allow  agencies  to  is-
sue  "interim rules" on remand, 29  so as to ensure against the harm that
may come from returning to the prerule status quo; and courts are  also
prepared,  in  appropriate  circumstances,  to  remand  rules  without  va-
cating  them.2'  The  "interim  rules"  approach  makes best  sense  when

the agency  can  show  that without  such  rules,  people will face  serious
risks of one kind or another;  the  "remand without vacating"  approach
makes best sense when  the agency may well be able to justify  its action
on remand.  Both of these ideas  are  designed to  ensure  that rules that
are  highly likely  to be  reasonable  are  not struck  from  the  books, in  a
way that  could produce  serious problems.  Properly  understood,  they
do  not allow  agencies  to  proceed with  inadequately justified rules  if it
appears  unlikely  that  those rules  could be  lawfully  explained,  or if it
appears that little will be lost with invalidation.

Hence  we  arrive  at  an  appropriate  approach  to  these  cases,  one
with  general  application:  The  rules  should  be  held unlawful,  and re-
manded  to  the agency;  but they  should  not be  vacated,  at least when
the agency can  show (a)  that it may  be able  to generate  a justification
that  will  satisfy  judicial  review,  and  (b)  that  invalidation  of the  rule
may generate  significant  risks  (by, for example,  allowing people to  be
exposed  to nontrivial  dangers,  or by preventing  the agency from  initi-
ating a program for reducing  such risks)?'°  After the agency  attempts
to justify its regulation  on remand,  its decision may be appealed to the
court,  which  can  evaluate  the new justification  and uphold  or  invali-
date  the regulation  as  appropriate.  An  approach  of this  kind  seems
especially  sensible for the particulates regulation, which is  designed  to
counteract  what,  on  a  reasonable  reading  of  the  evidence,  count  as
quite serious risks to life  and health.  The problem  with invalidation  is
that it would  prevent the  agency from  beginning implementation  and
require the agency to start largely from  scratch, a process  that may re-
quire  years or more  of rulemaking  activity.  A remand without  invali-
dation would  allow  the  agency  to  proceed  if  (as  appears  quite  possi-
ble)  the  regulation  can  be  adequately  defended  by  reference  to  the
criteria  I have  outlined.  Things  are  more  difficult for  ozone, because
the risks  are  far lower,  and because  nonregulation  may  actually  pro-
duce health benefits; 1'  but here as well, a remand without invalidation
would probably  be the best way to proceed.

It would be  possible to  object that the technique  of "remand  with-
out  invalidation"  creates  unfortunate  incentives  for  administrators,
above  all because  it  permits  the  continued  legality  and  even  the  en-

forcement  of rules  that  have  been  found  to  be  inadequately  justified
(and  that  may  not  ultimately  survive  review).  The  enforcement  of
these  rules may  cost millions  and  even  billions  of dollars.  If so,  isn't
invalidation  preferable?  To  be  sure,  a system  in  which inadequately
justified  rules  are invalidated  would  create  more pressure  to  produce
adequate  justifications  in  the first  instance.  But  the proper  response
to  this  concern  is not to invalidate  all inadequately  justified rules,  but
to  restrict the  "remand  without invalidation"  technique  to  special  cir-
cumstances,  above  all  (a) to rules  that might  well  turn  out to  be valid
(b) in  conditions  in  which  invalidation  would  produce  serious  prob-
lems for the legitimate policies that underlie the rules in question.  The
court  of appeals  for  the D.C.  Circuit has  made  considerable  progress
in drawing the necessary lines.'

There  is  a broader point  in the background  here.  The  techniques
of remand  without invalidation,  and of allowing  interim rules,  can  be
seen  as  a  form  of administrative  law  "minimalism,"  akin  to  judicial
minimalism  in  constitutional  law  generally." 3  Such  techniques  do  no
more than is necessary  to resolve  a case.  Indeed,  these  forms of mini-
malism  are  democracy-reinforcing  insofar  as  they  attempt  to  ensure
that  agency  decisions  are based  on grounds  that are  both  transparent
to the public and sufficient to justify the regulation  in light of statutory
criteria.

5.  A Health-Health Wrinkle

A difficult question, not addressed thus far, is raised by a particular
claim  with  respect  to  EPA's  ozone  regulation: 
that  ground-level
ozone  has health benefits,  and that these  benefits were  not taken  into
account  by the  agency.  There  is  evidence  that  ozone  reduces  the  risk
of  both  cataracts  and  cancers.3" 
If  taken  into  account,  the  health
benefits  of ozone  at current  levels  may well  be  roughly  equivalent  to
the health  costs.  But EPA  refused  to  consider  those  health  benefits.
In  an  interesting  application  of "health-health"  analysis,  the court  of
appeals  held that the refusal was unlawful. 5

In general,  it is right to say that agencies  should be required  to take
account  of the health  problems  sometimes  produced  by regulation  de-

signed  to reduce  health  problems.  This kind of health-health  tradeoff
can  take  many  different  forms.' 
In  typical  cases,  the  regulation  of
one  risk,  like  that  associated  with  asbestos,  may  give  rise  to  further
risks  as  a  result  of  the substituted  products.  The  most  adventurous
claims for  "health-health"  comparisons  arise  when a  costly regulation
imposes  health risks  simply by virtue of its cost2l  If a regulation  pro-
duces  less  employment  and  more  poverty,  it  may  result  in  worse
health  as well.  But these are  adventurous  claims, because they depend
on  contentious  projections  about  the  disemployment  effects  of  par-
ticular regulations.

For the ozone rule, the argument for taking health-health  tradeoffs
into  account seemed especially  insistent, for the claim was far from in-
direct,  and there was nothing  speculative  or abstruse  about the causal
chain.  If ozone  protects  against  cancers  and  cataracts,  it  is  possible
that a regulation of ozone will cause  serious health problems.  The text
of the Act is quite ambiguous  on the point, and the court was wrong  to
say  that it  unambiguously  required  the  agency  to  address  the  benefi-
cial  effects  of air  pollutants.RE  But  the  court  was  right  to  hold  that
even if it was ambiguous,  the agency interpretation was  unreasonable.
The rule was properly found inadequately justified on this ground, and
it may well  be  that after  remand, the agency  will be  unable to  explain
any failure  to take  account  of the effects  of ozone  in  combating  cata-
racts and cancer.

6.  A  Final Contrast

There  is  of course  a commonality  between  the  approach  taken by
the  American  Trucking  court  and  the  approach  I  am  suggesting.
Where  the American Trucking court  said that  the ambient  air  quality
standards provisions  of the Clean  Air Act  are unconstitutional  unless
EPA imposes  limits  on its own  discretion,  I have  argued that  ambient
air quality standards are valid if, and only if, EPA is able  to generate  a
"benefits  analysis"  that  operates  to  constrain  EPA  discretion  and  to
promote interregulation  consistency.  The goals  of the two approaches
are quite close.  The disadvantage  of the American Trucking approach
is  that  it involves  unnecessary,  even  reckless,  use  of the  Constitution
and  does  so  in  a  way  that  threatens  to  raise  too  many  questions
-
about too  many statutes.  By  contrast,  the approach  I have  suggested
has  firm  roots  in  the APA  and  in  existing  doctrine,  and promises  to

improve  regulatory  practice  without  calling  for  an  excessive  judicial
role.

C.  Congress: Safety and Its Cost

Should Congress  amend the national ambient air quality provisions
of the Clean Air Act?  This is not the place for an extended  discussion
of that question; but the analysis thus far suggests three possibilities.

1.  How Safe Is Safe Enough?

As  emphasized  throughout,  a  crucial  defect  of the  national  ambi-
ent air  quality provisions  is that they seem  to  assume  that whether  air
is  "safe"  can  be assessed  solely on the basis  of the facts.  The  truth is
that the facts might be able to show the degree of risk (at least within  a
range),  but they cannot show  whether  any  particular  degree  of safety
is  "safe  enough."  Whether  or not pollutants  lack safe thresholds,  "the
paradigm  of selecting  a standard  at the lowest-observable-effects-level
and then  providing  an  'adequate  margin  of safety'  is  not  possible.""3 9
The  result of the statutory framework  is to misframe  the key  question
and  also  to  give  EPA  little  guidance  for  answering  and  asking  that
question.  As  we  have  seen,  EPA  has  greatly  struggled  with  the  re-
sulting difficulties.

Congress  should amend the statute to  identify the factors  for EPA
to  consider  in making  the judgment  about  appropriate  national  stan-
dards.  Congress  might  offer  substantive  guidance  by  saying,  for  ex-
ample,  that EPA must  consider  risk severity,  size  of affected  popula-
tion,  and likelihood of adverse  effects  at various  exposure  levels.  On
the  procedural  side,  it  might  require  EPA  to  identify,  to  the  extent
possible,  the  nature  of  the risks  that  it  is  reducing,  and  at  the  same
time to attempt to quantify  the relevant risk reductions.  The strongest
argument against an amendment  to this  effect is that it is unnecessary;
if EPA  moved  in the  directions  suggested  above,  it would  essentially
be  interpreting the current statute  as if it contained  instructions  of ex-
actly this sort.  But an amendment  of this kind would at least provide  a
clear  legislative  signal,  and move  EPA judgments  in  the  direction  of
greater  transparency.

ticulate Matter and Ozone: Hearings Before the Subcomm.  on Commercial and Admin. Law

T. Woolf, Former Chairman, EPA's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee).

2.  More Flexible Tools

We  now know  that significant  cost savings  can be  achieved  by us-
ing more flexible, market-oriented  instruments,  such as tradable pollu-
tion permits rather than uniform national requirements?10  Sometimes,
however, EPA  does  not choose  such  instruments  even  when  it is  le-
gally authorized  to do so.31 
It would make sense to  amend the statute
to require  EPA, wherever  feasible,  to  use  economic  incentives  rather
than a "command-and-control"  approach? 2

It is  clear that an  approach  of this  kind could  save  substantial  re-
sources,  and  if  the  instruments  are  properly  chosen,  it  should  do  so
without  at the same time  compromising  air quality  goals."3  An  effort
to encourage EPA to select  less burdensome  alternatives  could send a
desirable  signal to attempt the least-cost  methods of obtaining  regula-
tory goals, and might in addition  spur creative  experimentation.

3.  Costs and Benefits

A  possible  lesson  of  EPA  experience  with  national  standards  is
that  EPA should  be  required  or  at least  permitted  to  consider  costs
when  setting  such  standards.  Indeed,  it is  not  entirely  clear  that  the
statute  should  be  construed  to  forbid  cost-benefit  analysis  from
EPA, 14 though lower  courts have unanimously  concluded otherwise.1 5
If the Supreme Court does not reject the lower courts'  view, it is worth
giving serious consideration to  a statutory  change.

The  basic  reasoning  here  is  straightforward.  If  a  reduction  from
0.08 to  0.07 would be  a trivial expense,  surely it should be  required; if

fairs, 104th Cong. 194 (1995)  (statement of Jonathan B. Wiener)  (urging general amendment

314.  After Chevron,  U.S.A.,  Inc. v. National Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467  U.S.
837  (1984),  ambiguities  in  the statute  are  to be resolved  by  the  agency, and  there is  a good
argument  that the key provision  of the  Act  is ambiguous.  Recall  that  the  statute requires
standards  to be set at a level  "requisite to  protect the public health,"  and it is not unreason-
able  to  say  that that  level is at  least partly  a function  of the  costs  of the  regulation.  What
level is "requisite"  may  well depend  on the  costs as well as  benefits  of getting there.  Ironi-
cally,  however,  the view  that the  agency can  choose, or  fail to  choose,  cost-benefit  analysis
seems  to  aggravate  rather than to  diminish the  old nondelegation  doctrine, even though  an
agency choice of that kind would seem to satisfy the new nondelegation doctrine.  See Indus-
trial Union v. OSHA, 37  F.3d 665,  669-70  (D.C. Cir. 1994)  (concluding that the  nondelega-
tion problem would be eliminated if OSHA chose  cost-benefit analysis).

it would  cost  billions  of dollars,  there  had better  be good  grounds  to
believe  very substantial  health  benefits  would  follow.  A possible  ar-
gument  to  the  contrary  is  that  national  standards  operate  as  aspira-
tions,  not  ordinary  law,  and  aspirations,  at least,  should  be  set  on  a
health-only  basis - not because  there is  a magic place where air qual-
ity  is  "safe,"  but because  it is  valuable  to  obtain,  and  use,  a  techno-
cratic judgment that people  should have  air  quality  of a  certain  speci-
fied sort 16  The problem  is that it is  impossible to  assess  "safety"  in  a
cost vacuum.  In general,  cost-benefit  analysis  should be followed,  ac-
knowledging that it will raise some hard questions  of value.317

The  best  argument  against  an amendment  to  require  cost-benefit
analysis  is that the statute, complex  as it is,  actually embodies  a better
accommodation  of  costs  and  benefits  than  would  a  statute  that  re-
quired  cost-benefit  analysis  at the level of standard-setting.31  On  this
view, the optimal system is one in which EPA makes  an initial,  purely
health-based judgment,  and then the process  of implementation  allows
costs to  play a role  at various  stages, emphatically  including  an expec-
tation that implementation  will  not be immediate  and  will in  fact be  a
product  of  a  continuing  inquiry  into  whether  compliance  is  worth-
while, P things  considered.1 9  A possible  virtue of this state  of affairs
is precisely  the  aspirational  quality  of the  health-based  standard,  set-
ting  a  target  against which  various  state  performances  can  be  meas-
ured.  The  aspirational  quality  can  also  contribute  to  technology-

316.  See the quotation  from  Administrator  Browner, supra text  accompanying  note 50.

Administrator Browner goes on to say:

While  cost-benefit analysis  is a tool that can be helpful in developing  strategies to  implement
our nation's air quality  standards, we  believe  it is inappropriate  for use  to set  the standards
themselves.  In many  cases,  cost-benefit  analysis  has overstated  costs.  In  addition,  many
kinds  of benefits  are virtually impossible to quantify - how do I put a dollar value on  reduc-
tions in a child's lung function  or the premature  aging  of lungs  or increased  susceptibility  to
respiratory  infection?

Clean Air Hearings, supra note 50,  at 282  (statement  of Carol  M. Browner,  Administrator,

monetization  of just this kind.  See generally infra app.

317.  See Sunstein, supra note 274.  A good treatment of some  of the  questions of value
can  be  found  in  recent  testimony  of Richard  Revesz.  See  Clean Air Act Authorizations:

& Politics Library,  U.S.  Congress  Folder, Federal Document  Clearing  House  Congressional
Testimony File.

318.  This seems to  be the conclusion  of William F. Pedersen, Science and Public Policy:
A  Case Study of the Clean Air Act, 16 PACE ENVT'L L. Rnv. 15 (1998).  Pedersen argues  that
a purely  health-based  standard can  force technological  innovation, see id. at 23-24,  and also
stimulate  and focus  public  debate,  see  id.  at  22-23; he  ends  with  the interesting  suggestion
that EPA  should  be  required  to  set standards  "tight  enough  to  protect  against  all  clearly
demonstrated  health  or welfare effects,"  but that  EPA  should be  allowed  to  consider  costs
and technical feasibility in choosing the  "margin of safety,"  id. at 30.

319.  See Farber, supra note 11,  at 315-18, for an illuminating discussion of this point.

forcing,  an important  and often  highly desirable  phenomenon  in  envi-
ronmental  protection,3"  and  a  phenomenon  to  which  cost-benefit
analysis is,  at least in practice,321 unlikely to contribute.

In the abstract, it is hard to know whether this pragmatic  argument
is valid.31  What is clear is that the statutory scheme, pragmatically  de-
fensible as it may be, is far from transparent,  and provides a set of con-
fusing signals  to the American public.

CONCLUSION

Whenever  an  agency issues a regulation  designed  to  diminish  risks
to  health, safety, or the environment,  it should  attempt to identify  the
gains  sought  by  the particular  regulation  it has  chosen,  and  it should
compare  these gains to those under at least two  reasonable  alternative
regimes, one stricter and one more lenient.  In this light, the most seri-
ous  problem  with  EPA's performance  in  issuing  national  air  quality
standards  is that it usually  fails to  explain,  in simple, concise  terms, its
decision  to  require  a  particular  level  of  ambient  air  quality.  Some-
times  EPA acts as  if it were pursuing  "safety"  and  ensuring  "safe  lev-
els,"  without  sufficiently  acknowledging  that  for most  pollutants,  the
serious  question  is what  degree  of safety.  To  its credit, EPA invaria-
bly offers  extensive  discussions  of the  underlying  data, demonstrating
that there is  a genuine health  risk at current  levels.  But to  the extent
that it provides an  explanation of its particular  choices,  the discussion
often involves little more than evidence  of nontrivial adverse  effects at
those  current  levels  -
evidence  that  may  well  argue  for  a  reduction
from current levels, but does not by itself call for any particular regula-
tory standard.

In  this  Article,  I  have  argued  that  EPA  (and  other  agencies  in-
volved  in  similar  tasks)  should  offer  a  detailed  "benefits  analysis."
The  central goal  of this  approach would be  to create  a  kind of federal
common  law  of  environmental  protection,  generated  in  the  first  in-

320.  Technology-forcing is not desirable if the costs of the forcing  exceed the benefits -
if, for  example,  the  new  technology  contributes  little  to  air  quality,  but  substantially  in-
creases prices and diminishes wages.

321.  In principle,  a  competent  cost-benefit  analysis would  include  the  costs  (and bene-
fits) of new technological developments,  and indeed this issue is  discussed in the particulates
and ozone  regulatory  impact  analysis.  See  RIA, supra note 70,  ch.  11.  The problem  is that
government  is  likely to  have  very  little  information  about the  cost  of technological innova-
tion,  and  industry  is  likely  to  overstate  those  costs  by  a significant  amount.  See W.  Kip
Viscusi, FATAL TRADEOFFS  161-80  (1993)  (discussing  substantial  overstatement  of compli-
ance costs).

in a Federal System -And  Why It  Matters, 54 MD. L. REV. 1226  (1995),  a staunch and long-
time  defender  of cost-benefit  analysis  for the  Clean  Air Act, who  acknowledges  the  prag-
matic  possibility.

stance  by  administrative  agencies,  and  designed  to  promote  consis-
tency and rationality in the protection of health and safety.  I have also
defended  a form  of democracy-promoting  minimalism for  administra-
tive law -
the particular  form  of minimalism that is  embodied in the
remand, often (and increasingly)  unaccompanied  by invalidation.

The  Clean Air  Act should  not be held  unconstitutional,  and  EPA
should not be required,  on pain of constitutional  invalidation,  to come
up with  a  "generic unit  of harm"  to  encompass  population  affected,
severity,  and probability.  The  new nondelegation  doctrine  is  a  large
mistake.  On  the other  hand,  ordinary  judicial review  should require
any  national  ambient  air  quality  standard  to  be  accompanied  by  an
adequate  explanation  of why that  level,  rather  than  one  more  or less
stringent,  has  been  selected.  By  itself, this  requirement  calls  (to  the
extent  feasible)  for  a high  degree  of quantification  from EPA;  it  also
bears  on the performance  of other regulatory  agencies  entrusted  with
the task of protecting  health,  safety,  and  the  environment.  It  calls for
invalidation,  and  not  merely remand,  where  the  agency  is  unable  to
offer an explanation of its choice of one level of regulation rather than
another.  A requirement  of this kind would mark a key moment in the
shift  from  the  rigidity  and  simplicity  of  1970s  environmentalism  to-
ward  a  new  and more  promising  approach  -
one  that  places  a high
premium  on  assessing  the  magnitude  of  problems,  ensuring  consis-
tency  across  regulations,  limiting  interest-group  power, acquiring  bet-
ter  information,  and  authorizing  democratic  control  of  regulatory
choices.

My  principal  claim  here  is  that  both  courts  and  EPA  should  con-
strue the Act so as to prevent  regulation of small risks and so as to re-
quire  regulation  of  substantial  risks  -
and  EPA  should  explain,  as
quantitatively  as  possible,  what  must be  shown  in  order for  a  risk  to
qualify,  or  not  to  qualify,  as  substantial.  It  is  excessive,  a  form  of
rhetoric, to  say  that  on EPA's view, it is  entitled  to choose  any level
between  zero  risk  and  a  level  slightly  below  "London's  Killer  Fog."
But it is not a form  of rhetoric to think that if EPA has  not limited its
own discretion by speaking in less conclusory  terms, the Clean  Air Act
raises  problems  for  both  regulatory  policy  and  democratic  self-
government.  The  ultimate  goal  of  the  forms  of  the  democracy-
promoting  minimalism  that I have  endorsed  here would  be  to ensure
better  policy  analysis  and  greater  transparency  of  decision,  in  a  way
that  should  simultaneously  promote  democratic,  economic,  and  air
quality goals.

340.  Only endpoints  denoted with an * are aggregated into total benefits  estimates.
341.  Mortality  estimates  must  be aggregated  using  either short-term exposure  or long-

term exposure  but not both, due to double-counting  issues.
