 Cass R. Sunstein the Court The assisted suicide cases are the most dramatic to come before the Supreme Court in recent years, and one of the most striking (and certainly well-publicized) documents before is widely known as The Philosophers' Brief.' The Brief bears Ronald Dworkin's distinctive mark, and indeed Dworkin is listed as lead counsel, though the Brief is also signed by Thomas Nagel, Robert Nozick, John Rawls, Thomas Scanlon, and Judith Jarvis Thompson. The Philosophers' Brief offers an ambitious and highly theoretical argument. It says that some "deeply personal decisions pose controversial questions about how and why human life has value. In a free society, individuals must be allowed to make those decisions for themselves, out of their own faith, conscience, and convictions." 2 The Brief urges that distinctions between "omissions" (failing to provide continued treatment) and "acts" "based on a misunderstanding of the pertinent moral principles. "3  Drawing on the abortion cases, the Brief says that every person "has a right to make the 'most to personal dignity and autonomy,'" a right that encompasses "some control over the time and manner of one's death." 4  The Brief thus urges the Court to declare a constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide. Dworkin's personal gloss on the Brief says that the requested right "defines a very general moral and intimate and personal choices central that will produce death) are (providing drugs Karl N.

Nussbaum, David Strauss, and Richard Posner for helpful comments and discussion. invoke fundamental arguments, this disagreement helps get to As a matter of political morality, the argument in the Philosopher's Brief is certainly reasonable, and it cannot easily be shown to be wrong. But I do not think that the Supreme Court should declare a right to physicianassisted suicide, and the heart of my disagreements with Professor Dworkin. I believe that the Court should generally be reluctant to invalidate legislation on the basis of abstract philosophical arguments, because the Court is poorly equipped to evaluate those on which philosophical arguments tend to be silent, matter a great deal to law. By contrast, Dworkin appears to think that the Supreme Court should not much hesitate to find a constitutional right of some kind if it is presented with (what judges can be persuaded to find) convincing philosophical arguments for that right, at least if the right "fits" with the rest of the legal fabric. Thus while Professor Dworkin and I do not much disagree on what justice requires, we do disagree, hardly all the time but I suspect not rarely, about the appropriate path of the Supreme Court of the United States. Yet I find much to accept, and to admire, in Professor Dworkin's essay here.7 Dworkin's attack on modem challenges to "objectivity" strikes Skepticism about moral truth is indeed me as right and convincing. incoherent-hopeless for law or for anything else. An argument for incompletely theorized agreements cannot sensibly be rooted in skepticism. (Hence there is all the difference in the world between skepticism and a recognition of cognitive or motivational limitations on the part of certain people engaged in distinctive social roles.) As an abstraction or a creed, "antitheory" makes no sense. The notion of "justificatory ascent" rightly signals the fact that a judge may have to get ambitious in order to think well about some cases. 9 Dworkin is correct to say that "there is no a priori or wholesale test for deciding when [such an ascent] will be required. A lawyer or judge must be well along in thinking about an issue before he knows and professional grounds It is also true that any analogical argument depends on an argument of some kind, and hence on a theory of some kind. The distinction between for distrusting philosophical metaphysical abstractions is quite important. Dworkin's suggestion that my own argument rests on "professional" (or role-dependent) grounds is entirely right. And Dworkin has described my own position with both courtesy and care; for It may even be right to say, with Dworkin, that I am extremely grateful. that those who celebrate incompletely theorized agreements in a qualified way are, in important respects, in the same basic camp as Dworkin." And it is nice to see an essay praising theory begin with the suggestion, "Examples are better than anything ....."12 With all this agreement, why might anyone be reluctant to join a chorus of praise for abstraction in law? There are three reasons. The first is mostly a matter of emphasis; the second is more substantial, though in the end it may be a matter of emphasis too; the third involves the limited role of it lies at the heart of my the Court in the constitutional system, and disagreement with the Philosophers' Brief. My basic suggestions are that Dworkin places too little emphasis on the need to attend to facts, which are crucial to law, and gives too little attention to issues of institutional role, which are a central part of constitutional law, Dworkin's particular concern. Judges ordinarily work with principles of a low level of theoretical ambition. Conceptual ascents are relatively rare in law. Like all of us, judges have limited time and capacities, and like almost all of us, judges are not trained philosophers. They know that if they try to resolve large philosophical issues, they may blunder badly. In these circumstances judges try, to the extent that they can, to bracket large-scale issues of the good and the right, and to decide cases on grounds that seem reasonable to those who have diverse views on those issues, and (perhaps even more important) to those who have little idea what, on those issues, their views are. (1996), for the important idea of economizing on moral disagreement. for example, have emphasized Professor Dworkin appears to celebrate Roe v. Wade; he thinks that the decision reflects the right conception of constitutional liberty under law, and that (for that reason) the case was rightly decided. I think that the decision has created unnecessary problems for the Court and the nation. It did so because in its (wholly unnecessary) breadth and in its blindness to matters of fact and institutional role (on which more below), the Court did too much too soon, in a way that has had enduring harmful effects on American life (emphatically including that part of American life that involves equality on the basis of sex 2 3). It does not much matter if any of these particular claims is convincing; I offer them simply for purposes of illustration. What matters is that those who stress incompletely theorized agreements on particulars are likely to seek to avoid conceptual ascents if (and only if) they can, especially when courts are asked to invalidate legislation on constitutional grounds. This idea leads in directions that Professor Dworkin appears to reject. But perhaps this point is really about institutional issues-or about professionspecific norms-on which more in a moment. (and an My second difference with Professor Dworkin-and I am not sure that it is a disagreement-involves the role of facts. In my view, the greatest achievement of the well-known Chicago School incompletely theorized agreement may be possible on this point) has been to draw attention to the central importance of facts to an understanding of law. What does law actually do? This is a question on which the content of law must (at least partly) depend, and it is a question that lawyers and judges ask too infrequently, and answer with inadequate tools. What, for example, are the effects of laws calling for minimum wages, rent controls, implied warranties of various sorts, liability for drug manufacturers? Philosophy alone will not tell us; we need to investigate facts. And much of normative jurisprudence, with its heavy philosophical bent, continues to operate in a factual vacuum. intended If normative jurisprudence to produce not only illumination but also answers to legal questions, this is beyond unfortunate, for problems involving libel law, sexual privacy, homosexuality, and the right to die depend in large part on underlying issues of fact. I do not know how to approach the product liability questions that Professor Dworkin raises without investigating a range of factual details; judicial assessment of philosophical claims-figuring out what is "fair"-is at most a start. If courts imposed liability on DES manufacturers without a demonstration of causation, would there be adverse consequences on the pharmaceutical market? Might such liability result in systematically higher prices, which and from courts general movement-away toward administrative regulation-may well be the most important institutional development of the twentieth century. Because it is a sensible response to institutional limitations of the judiciary-limitations involving not theory (as Dworkin understands it) but understandings of fact and consequences-that movement is (mostly) to be celebrated. Of course Professor Dworkin is aware of the development, but in his work on legal interpretation he does not much discuss it. The gap is notable in light of the fact that, in what is by far the most important case on legal interpretation in the last two decades, the Supreme Court ruled that precisely because interpretation involves judgments of policy and principle, ambiguous statutes will be interpreted by the regulatory agencies entrusted with their implementation.2 9 Now of course any assessment of facts is theory-laden; as Dworkin rightly stresses, we do not know what and how facts count unless we have a (normative) account. Nothing I have said here denies this point. But many legal debates are sterile-conceptualistic, precisely because the participants do not investigate facts, when it is facts on which they may be able to make some progress. Perhaps most important, an understanding of the facts may well equip people with different theoretical positions to converge on the same judgment. If, for example, an increase in rent control can be shown to diminish the available housing stock, in a way that particularly hurts the poor, perhaps people can reject rent control terminological, interminable The point bears on approaches to legal interpretation as well, where an assessment of relevant facts can be quite important. To see the point, let us turn to two cases of considerable interest to Professor Dworkin. In Riggs v. Palmer, the New York Court of Appeals held that a nephew, who had murdered his uncle in order to inherit from him, could not receive his inheritance, notwithstanding language of the statutes governing wills made no exception for murderers. 31 The Court carved out an exception from the apparently plain language of the statute. In Tennessee 32 Valley Authority ("TVA ") v. Hill, that the Endangered Species Act prohibited the government from completing a dam, because completion would endanger the snail darter, a fish of little ecological interest. 33 The Court refused to carve out an exception from the apparently plain language of the statute. Professor Dworkin thinks that Riggs was rightly decided and TVA v. Hill wrongly decided, because the court's task is to make the best constructive sense of a past legislative event, a task that called for judgments against the nephew and for the TVA. 34 the Supreme Court held insistence I do not disagree so much with the proposed results as with this manner of approaching the cases. In my view, a great deal depends on issues involving incentives and comparative competence, and these have a large empirical dimension. On this count there are many relevant questions. What incentives would be created for legislatures by decisions like Riggs v. Palmer, or by judicial (as the dissenting judge urged) on mechanical application of the apparently unambiguous text? Would the latter course lead legislatures to be more careful in advance, and might they enact exceptions after the fact when exceptions make sense? Would the costs of decision, including the problem of legal uncertainty, much increase if courts were willing to decide cases the way Professor Dworkin wants? What is the likelihood from apparently plain the best constructive interpretation? These questions are unlikely to have context-free answers; they depend on assessments of institutional capacities and performance. 35 that judges would blunder if they made exceptions interest of language the in For what it is worth, I believe that Riggs v. Palmer was right (and thus I agree with Dworkin), because (to make a long story short) no reasonable person could want a murderer to inherit, and because this easilycontained exception from the statute would cause little increase in legal uncertainty. And I believe that TVA v. Hill was also right (and I disagree here with Dworkin), because reasonable people could seek to protect the snail darter under the circumstances of the case and because this (hard to confine) exception from the statute would create a great deal of doubt about the future meaning of the Endangered Species Act. But these conclusions are far less important than the claim that an assessment of the underlying issues requires not only conceptual analysis about what makes something "law," or some particular law the best it can be, but also a set of predictions, largely the consequences of alternative interpretive approaches in light of the capacities and likely performance of relevant institutions. factual Some members of the most prominent Chicago School, and here I happily join that School, may be against (some kinds of) theory in the (very limited) sense that they are pro-facts. To the extent that there is a single message in Judge Posner's Overcoming Law, I think that this is it. In this respect Professor Dworkin's emphasis on the (occasional) need for good theory strikes me not so much wrong-indeed it is not wrong at all-as misdirected. It suggests that a better legal system will come from a legal system that is better at philosophy-as if the real flaw of American law is inadequate philosophy. This, again, is not without truth; better philosophy might well make law better-more fair, coherent, less confused-in some contexts. But any claim of this sort should be supplemented by an emphasis on the need for a better sense of underlying facts. Does the problem with of sports. In the 1997 playoffs, five New York Knicks players left the bench during a fight on the court, and National Basketball Association officials suspended the players in accordance with a rule that calls for an automatic suspension whenever players leave the bench during a fight. One of the suspended players, Patrick Ewing, left the bench but did not get close to the melee. Did the NBA officials properly interpret the rule? Professor Dworkin thinks not. He says, "You don't punish people for acts that not only don't cause harm, but aren't even of the kind to cause the harm that the statute was designed to prevent." See Asking Around, NEW YORKER, June 2, 1997, at 35. But an important question is whether attention to the purpose of the rule ("the harm that the statute was designed to prevent") significantly increases the costs of decision (and uncertainty)-and also introduces risks of error of its own, partly because of bias, partly because of difficulties in accurately characterizing the purposes of the rule. Hence Dworkin-a New Yorker and perhaps a Knicks fan?-seems to me not to have come to terms with the best arguments on behalf of the officials' mechanical and on one view extremely wonderful interpretation of the rule. (On the other hand, candor compels the perhaps unsurprising confession that the present author tends to favor the World Champion Chicago Bulls.) The same basic point applies to the law of tort as tort law is too, emphatically developed by judges; it bears on constitutional including the right to physician-assisted suicide. This point-I have saidmay not amount to a disagreement with Professor Dworkin, but it has concrete consequences for how to do and to think about law. For example, the philosophical abstractions offered in the Philosopher's Brief seem to me reasonable; certainly it cannot easily be shown that they are wrong. But (even putting the institutional issues to one side), do they make out a case for a constitutional right, invalidating enacted law in almost all states? I do not believe that they do. 37  Even if the theoretical claims are right, much depends on empirical projections. In my view, the Philosophers' Brief is not convincing (a normative as well as empirical claim) largely because it does not sufficiently explore institutional issues or concerns of the sort just raised-the inevitable focus of the Court itself4°-and mostly relies instead on a combination of (reasonable) philosophical abstractions and passages from Supreme Court decisions. To be sure, the Brief is not oblivious to the underlying problems, and it makes a reference in this regard to the need for procedural safeguards to counteract those problems. But such safeguards, however well-designed they may be on paper, cannot alleviate the underlying concerns, which are (it is necessary to emphasize) empirical rather than a priori in character. A possible conclusion is that the federal system is admirably well-adapted to deal with Indeed, Oregon is this issue, for it can engage in a range of experiments. now embarking on such an experiment, and other states will undoubtedly follow. We should know what such a right would mean in practice before we insist that it should exist in law. Who could possibly object to the adoption, by judges or anyone else, of a good theory about the right or the good? If judges are able to identify the appropriate category of rights, shouldn't they? If a conception of rights embodies the appealing notion that a heterogeneous society consists of a community of equals, why shouldn't the Court identify that (by hypothesis) very appealing conception? Dworkin, asking such questions, is puzzled about why anyone would want our judges to be ostriches. Isn't an antipathy to theory a kind of willful blindness, or a form of philistinism? Judges are not ostriches, and their caution about theory stems from the distinctive place where they stand, which requires an understanding of the particular role of judges in the American political system. Cognitive limitations, accepted as such by participants in all social practices, are a central part of any account of the responsibilities of those who find Judges are not (let us repeat the point) themselves in a particular role. theoretically ambitious trained as philosophers, and judges who make arguments may well make mistakes that are quite costly, especially in constitutional cases, where their arguments are (at least theoretically!) final. We can find many instances of (what Professor Dworkin and I would agree But these cases are aberrations, and thankfully so. A large part of the distinctive morality of adjudication is role-morality, and it involves the presumptive avoidance of theoretically ambitious arguments as a ground for invalidating enacted law. Thus courts generally seek, because of their own understanding of their limited capacities, to offer low-level rationales on is so especially when the which diverse people may converge. consequence of theoretical ambition would be to invalidate the outcomes of democratic processes; it is here that the Court properly proceeds cautiously, again because of its understanding of its limited capacities in thinking about philosophical abstractions. And it is notable that an emphasis on these points focuses attention on institutions and practices that Dworkin's enthusiasm for philosophical argument tends to obscure: administrative agencies, state-bystate experimentation, and legislative rather than judicial solutions. to the accounts may divert An analogy may be helpful here. Of course there is a sense in which philosophy is foundational to law, just as theoretical physics is in some sense foundational to the construction of airplanes. And at times those who build airplanes need to know something about theoretical physics. But in ordinary practice, those confronted with the problems produced by the construction of airplanes are not assisted by accounts of the foundations of physics; such accounts may be confusing to people of limited time and capacities, and from successful attention performance of the tasks at hand. The same goes for ordinary judges and lawyers. The issues raised by the asserted right to physician-assisted suicide require, among other things, intense focus on particulars and (especially important) close attention to facts. Would such a right, in practice, undermine the autonomy of those approaching death, and give excessive in a way that threatens to produce nonvoluntary and power to doctors, involuntary death? Would such a right undermine many particular practices now taken as legitimate (consider the activities of the Food and Drug Administration), and if so how might that fact count against the right? the builders Of course these conclusions raise many questions, and they are themselves theory-laden.47 Most of the ordinary work of law is incompletely theorized, and hence courts have not self-consciously adopted theoretical arguments on behalf of the latter two qualifications, even though the law generally seems to follow them. To defend the qualifications, it would be necessary to make some claims about institutional capacities and the nature and primacy of democratic self-government. And the view that the judicial role is properly aggressive when democratic obstacles beset ordinary politics may itself have to be theorized, both in defending the general claim and in specifying it by giving content to the notion of democratic obstacles. I think these theoretically ambitious arguments should be accepted by courts, as indeed they largely have been, because and to the extent that they can be shown to be clearly true. What must be emphasized is that these arguments suggest-and there really is no contradiction herethat the distinctive morality of adjudication in a pluralistic society calls for a presumption in favor of theoretical modesty, especially when courts are asked to invalidate legislation. is here that my difference from Professor Dworkin has some consequences. In the context of the right to physician-assisted suicide, an incompletely theorized agreement in favor of invalidation seems hard to obtain. 8 Judges who sit on the Supreme Court are rightly reluctant to reject the considered moral judgments of their fellow citizens. The reluctance might be overcome if those moral judgments were plainly wrong, or if there was a problem in the system of democratic deliberation that has produced barriers to physician-assisted suicide. But the moral issues are complex, in large part because reasonable people believe that in practice a right to physician-assisted suicide would undermine patient autonomy, rightly understood. In these circumstances courts should be cautious about invoking philosophical abstractions invalidate the outcomes of democratic processes . Dworkin responds to the plea for judicial modesty largely by invoking the fact that the Court has been invested with the power of judicial review. He thinks that I have confused the question of jurisdiction with the question of justification. But I wonder whether the confusion is not his rather than mine. The existence of jurisdiction-of judicial review-is quite uninformative on the standard of review or the occasions for deference. American judges have a wide range of devices by which to counteract their theorized the preference own distinctive agreements is one of those devices. As Dworkin ably shows, there is no (good) abstract argument against abstractions. But there are reasons, both concrete and abstract, both empirical and theoretical, to think that judges in a deliberative democracy do best if they (usually) avoid the most contentious abstractions when they can, especially if they are asked to invalidate enacted law. for
