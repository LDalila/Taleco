Deliberation,  Polarization,  and
Punitive  Damages

I.  Introduction

How does group deliberation affect individual judgments?  How
does the outcome of  jury deliberations differ from  some aggregation
of  individual decisions pre-deliberation? Speculation  is  not  difficult.
Perhaps  juries  converge  toward  the  mean  of  individual  judgments;
perhaps  juries  move  away  from,  or  toward,  the  high  or  low  of
individual extremes. Perhaps juries approach an outcome that is more
just  or  more  accurate;  perhaps  juries  produce  more  predictable  and
less erratic judgments, so that  unpredictability at the  individual level,
or at the  level of  the  mean  or  median  of  (six  or  twelve)  individual
judgments,  does  not  exist  at  the  jury  level.  A  pervasive  question  is
whether  a  deliberating  jury  has  the  effect  of  producing  outcomes
that treat the similarly situated similarly—perhaps in terms of  civil or
criminal liability (do people who  have engaged in  the  same conduct
receive  the  same  verdict?),  perhaps 
in  the  determination  of
appropriate  damage  awards,  either  compensatory  or  punitive  (do
similarly situated people receive the same awards?).1

We attempt  to make some progress on  these questions. We  do
so principally by reporting the  results of  an  extensive study of  mock

is 

finding 

increased 

deliberation 

juries (over 500 juries in total). In  the  study, these juries were  asked
to  deliberate  about  punitive  damage  awards;  individual  judgments
were collected before the  jury deliberated. To  compress a long  story,
our  principal 
both
that 
unpredictability  and  variance,  by  making  large  awards  much  larger
smaller  still.  Thus  the  principal  effect  of
and  small  awards 
deliberation is often  to polarize individual judgments,  a pattern  that
has  been  found  in  many  other  group  decision  making  contexts.2
This  finding—the  first  of  its  kind  in  the  particular  context  of
punitive damage awards—has important implications for jury awards
involving  both  punitive  and  compensatory  damages.  It  bears  on
group deliberation in other contexts as well. The  same phenomenon
of polarization that occurs in  our punitive damage juries can  be used
to explain why  a group of people moderately predisposed in favor of
gun  control  will,  after discussion, tend  to be more  than  moderately
predisposed  in  that  direction,  and  why  a  group  of  individuals
cautiously opposed to  affirmative action  is likely, after  discussion,  to
oppose affirmative action with considerable fervor.

The  study reported here has  the  advantage  of  being  extremely
close  to—in  fact  part  of  the  design  is  based  on—an  earlier  one
involving  not  deliberating juries but responses  of  899  individuals  to
punitive  damage  cases.3  Our  earlier  study  showed  a  remarkable
consensus in individual judgments, made along a bounded numerical
scale,  about  a  series  of  personal  injury  cases.  That  study  therefore
found  that  with  respect  to  the  underlying  moral  evaluation,  different
(synthetic,  non-deliberating4) 
similar

likely  to  reach 

juries  are

twelve reflecting the “verdict.” See 107 Yale LJ at 2098.

conclusions  about  the  relative  severity  of  different  cases.5  Thus  all-
white,  all-poor,  all-rich,  all-educated,  all  poorly  educated,  all-male,
all-female, all-young, and all-old juries would  probably come  to very
similar rankings of a set of cases, at least in  personal injury cases and
very possibly elsewhere.6 It  follows  that  averaging the  judgments  of
any  random  group  of  twelve  people  is  likely  to  produce  a  moral
judgment  that  predicts, with  a  reasonably  high  degree  of  accuracy,
the judgment of any other group of twelve people. At the same time,
the  study  found  that  when  asked  to  assess  cases  in  terms  of  dollars,
(synthetic,  non-deliberating)  juries  become  extremely  unpredictable.7
They  become unpredictable in  the  specific sense that  the  judgment
of any particular group of twelve is a poor predictor of  the  judgment
of  other  groups of  twelve.8 We  speculated that  it  is  the  dollar  scale
that accounts for evidently erratic monetary judgments in many  areas
of  the  law,  including  not  only  punitive  damages  but  compensatory
awards  in  areas  involving 
libel,  sexual  harassment,  pain  and
suffering,9 and  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress.10  When
juries  use  the  dollar  scale,  their  verdicts  probably  do  not  treat  the
similarly situated similarly, with some awards that are arbitrarily  high
and others that are arbitrarily low.  This  unpredictability is also likely
to  produce  overdeterrence  in  risk-averse  defendants  or  in  any  case
muffled and confusing (and to that extent costly) signals.11

A natural question is, however, raised by these conclusions. This
question is one of concern to those interested in damages, juries, and

8  Note  that  in  our  study  we  hold  constant  several  factors  that  can  be  used  to
in  punitive  damage  awards,  such  as
capture  some  of  the  variability 
compensatory  damages,  case  category,  case  particulars,  and  jurisdiction.  It  has
been  proposed  by  some  authors  that  when  analyzed  using  these  factors,
punitive awards are reasonably predictable.  See  Theodore  Eisenberg  et  al.,  The
Predictability  of  Punitive  Damages,  26  J.  Legal  Stud.  623  (1997),  Because  we
hold these factors constant, the unpredictability that we  documented previously,
and that we document here, cannot be accounted for by any of these factors.

deliberative processes in  general12: whether  a deliberating jury might
reduce or even eliminate the  unpredictability of dollar awards. How
does  the  process  of  jury  deliberation  affect  the  remarkable  moral
consensus?  Will  different  juries  converge  toward  the  same  dollar
amount? The answers should have implications not only for punitive
awards, but also for other  damage judgments,  certainly  when  these
are hard to monetize, and possibly for questions of  civil and criminal
liability  as  well  and  even  for  deliberation  generally.  An  additional
question,  also  important,  is  what  happens  to  dollar  awards  when
juries  deliberate:  As  compared  with  individual  conclusions  pre-
deliberation, do such awards tend  to go up, go down,  or remain  the
same?

On the basis of a study of 3048 jury-eligible citizens in  Phoenix,
Arizona,  participating  in  509  mock  juries,  we  offer  two  principal
conclusions here, which  we  now  state in  somewhat  less compressed
form.  The  first  is  that  juries  do  not  produce  less  erratic  and  more
predictable  awards  than  individuals.  On  the  contrary,  deliberating
juries tend  to  generate,  with  respect  to  dollar  awards,  even  greater
variance and unpredictability than is present in the  judgments  of  the
jurors who  compose them.  This  is no  mere technical  conclusion;  it
suggests  that  the  problem  of  erratic  awards  is  intensified,  not
reduced, by deliberating juries.

The  second  conclusion,  a  corollary  of  the  first,  is  that
deliberating  juries  significantly,  and  systematically,  increase  large
punitive  damage  awards  and  also  decrease  small  punitive  damage
awards.  In  our  study,  jury  judgments  were  more  lenient  than
individual juror judgments for cases of less serious misconduct by the
defendant;  for  cases  of  moderately  serious  and  very  serious
misconduct,  however,  jury  judgments  were  harsher,  in  many  cases
dramatically so. In 21% of the cases, the jury verdict was as high as or
higher  than 
judgment  pre-
deliberation. As we  discuss  below,  this  result  is  part  of  the  general
phenomenon  of  group  polarization,  in  accordance  with  which  a
deliberating group tends to shift  toward  a  more  extreme  version  of

that  of  the  highest 

individual 

                                                
12 On the latter  topic,  see  Amy  Gutmann  and  Dennis  Thompson,  Democracy
and  Disagreement  (1997);  our  analysis  of  group  polarization  raises  some
questions  for  the  deliberative  conception  of  democracy,  though  we  leave  those
questions  largely  implicit  here.

5

the  views  its  members  brought  with  them.  The  phenomenon  of
group  polarization—with  discussion  amplifying  initial  individual
tendencies,  whatever  they  may  be13—operates  in  accordance  with
identifiable  mechanisms  (thus  far  unexamined  within  the  legal
culture),  which,  unfortunately,  do  not  suggest  that  the  shifts  are
necessarily desirable, or that they implement  any legitimate concerns
of the legal system.

What  follows  at  the  normative  level?  The  safest  and  most
cautious conclusion  is that  to the  extent  that  unpredictable punitive
damage  awards  raise  a  serious  concern,  the  problem  is  magnified
rather  than  diminished  by  the  process  of  deliberation.  But  is  the
increase in  awards a tribute to  the  benefits  of  collective  discussion?
Without  an  independent  theory  of  what  awards  should  be,  the
evidence found here does not rule out that hopeful conclusion. But it
certainly provides no affirmative support for it, or for the  suggestion
that  group deliberation will,  in  this context,  increase  the  rationality
and  soundness  of  outcomes.  On  the  contrary,  the  substantial
increases of  high  awards and  the  (smaller)  decreases  in  low  awards
are predictable consequences of the  effects of  deliberation on  a scale
having a lower bound but lacking an upper bound.

In  these circumstances, there  are  two  implications  for  reform.
The first involves the possibility, now shown to be feasible, of  asking
jurors to generate not a dollar figure, but a normative judgment  on  a
bounded numerical scale. As we  will  explain,  the  deliberating  juries
in  this study  were  able  to  use  a  punishment  scale  quite  effectively;
such a scale might  be used as the  foundation  of  dollar  awards,  in  a
way  that  could  dramatically  decrease  unpredictability.  The  second
implication  follows  from  the  fact  that  deliberation  increases  high
awards and decreases low  ones, in  a way  that  increases variance and
unpredictability. To the extent that unpredictability is a problem, our
findings provide additional support for the view that  punitive awards
should  be  made  not  by  juries,  but  by  judges  or  some  kind  of
administrative institution.14
                                                
13 Note also that mere exposure  to  the  views  of  others,  without  discussion,  has
a  similar  amplifying  effect.  See  David  Myers,  Polarizing  Effects  of  Social
Comparison, 14 J Experimental Soc. Psych. 554 (1978).

II.  Theoretical  Preliminaries:  Outrage  and  Scales
Jury awards of  punitive damages have become  one  of  the  most
controversial  topics  in  modern  public  law.15  To  take  just  one
example, an award of $4.9 billion against General Motors attracted a
great deal of national  attention  in  July, 1999.16 It  is  now  clear  that
the due process clause imposes constraints on  permissible awards.17 A
number  of  statutes,  enacted  and  proposed,  create  punitive  damage
“caps,”18  and  high  awards  have  become  a  primary  impetus  for  tort
reform in general.19 There are also controversial issues about punitive
damage  awards 
sexual
harassment.20  At  the  same  time,  the  problems  created  by  punitive
awards bear on related questions in other areas of  the  law,  involving,

for example, compensatory damages for pain and suffering,  libel, and
intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress.21  Similar  problems  arise
whenever an administrative agency is asked to impose civil fines and
also in the area of criminal sentencing.22

Participants  in  the  legal system are often  requested to come up
with  some  kind  of  judgment,  factual  or  normative,  and  then  to
“translate” that judgment into a dollar award. In  the  area of  punitive
damages, it is necessary to make some assessment of  the  character of
the defendant’s behavior, and then to ascertain the appropriate dollar
amount  to be paid to the  plaintiff  by way  of  punishment.  In  many
domains, compensatory judgments raise similar puzzles. While  juries
are  nominally  expected  to  find  a  “fact”—what  amount  of  money
would  restore  the  plaintiff  to  the  status  quo  ante?—it  is  often
extremely  difficult  to  monetize  the  relevant  harm,  and  normative
judgments  undoubtedly  play  a  significant  role.23  In  the  case  of
punitive damages, it is extremely difficult for even experts to agree on
what  dollar amount  constitutes adequate  “punishment”  or  produces
an appropriate deterrrent signal.

In all  of  these areas, the  legal system is pervaded by a degree of
unpredictability  and  variance,  resulting  in  apparent  arbitrariness,  as
similarly situated people are treated  differently.24  An  extensive  study
of pain and suffering cases found that as much as 40% of  the  awards
consists of  “noise,” unexplained by objective factors.25  A  study  of  all
reported  sexual  harassment  cases  was  unable  to  connect  either
compensatory  or  punitive  awards  to  any  case  characteristics  that

might be thought  to explain jury judgments.26 The  punitive damage
area  is  more  complicated—a  point  to  which  we  will  return
shortly—but there is evidence of  significant variability here as well.27
The  most  ambitious  claims  to  the  contrary  attempt  to  show  that
once  the  compensatory  award  has  been  made,  the  punitive  award
becomes  predictable  to  a  certain  degree28;  but  the  same  data  show
that  at the  time a case is filed, it is very hard to know  the  expected
punitive award, and that there is a generally a great deal of  “noise” in
outcomes.29

To  understand the  current  study,  it  is  necessary  to  understand
its predecessor by the way of background. Our earlier study involved a
demographically  diverse  set  of  jury-eligible  citizens  from  Austin,
Texas.30 The  relevant  experiment  involved  28  personal  injury  cases,
which  respondents  were  asked  to  assess  in  one  of  three  ways:
outrageousness,  on  a  bounded  numerical  scale  (0  to  6);  intent  to
punish,  on  a  bounded  numerical  scale  (also  0  to  6);  and  actual

                                                
26 See Judy  Shih  ad Cass  R.  Sunstein,  Damages  in  Sexual  Harassment  Cases,
forthcoming  in  Sexual  Harassment  (Catharine  MacKinnon  and  Reva  Seigel
eds. 1999)
27  See  Karpoff  and  Lott,  supra  note.  There  is  some  dispute  over  the  degree  of
unpredictability.  Theodore  Eisenberg  et  al.,  The  Predictability  of  Punitive
Damages, 26 J. Legal Stud. 623 (1997), shows that the log of punitive  awards  is
predicted  reasonably  well  from  a  set  of  objective  characteristics  of  cases  i n
which  awards  were  made;  in  particular,  it  is  shown  that  the  compensatory
award is a fairly good predictor  of  the  punitive  award.  See  id.  at 644.  In  terms
of  real  dollars  rather  than  log  dollars,  however,  there 
is  a  degree  of
unpredictability  in  the  Eisenberg  data as  well,  because the  severe  skewness  of
the awards creates a possibility of either small or huge awards in  identical  cases.
See also Karpoff and Lott, supra.

Note  also  that  predictability  can  be  understood  in  different  ways:  (a)
predictability  exists  when  case  characteristics  predict  punitive  awards;  (b)
predictability exists when the judgments  of  one  group  of  six  or  twelve  predicts
the judgments of  another  group  of  six  or  twelve;  (c) predictability  exists  when
an  actor  can  assess  expected  liability  when  something  goes  wrong.  Our
principal  emphasis  here  is  on  (b);  Eisenberg’s  emphasis  is  on  (a);  both  are
relevant to (c). Of course the three are closely related in practice.

awards, on  the  unbounded  scale  of  dollars.  As  noted,  our  principal
findings  were  twofold.  People’s moral  judgments  are  widely  shared
and predictable, in  fact  strikingly  so,  at  least  in  the  personal  injury
cases studied in  the  experiment.31 But in  spite  of  this  point,  and  in
the  presence  of  shared  moral  judgments,  people’s  judgments  on  a
dollar  scale—the  scale,  or  “response  mode,”  favored  by  the  legal
system—are  highly  unpredictable  in  the  sense  that  the  median
judgment  of  any  group  of  twelve  people  is  an  extremely  poor
predictor  of  the  median  judgment  of  any  other  group  of  twelve
people.32  Lacking  a  reliable  understanding  of  how  deliberation
would affect individual judgments, we  used the  median of  groups of
twelve  individuals,  randomly  selected  from  our  pool  of  899  and
combined  into  a large number  of “synthetic  juries.”33 At least in  the
experimental setting,  the  primary identifiable  source  of  the  noise  is
the  difficulty  jurors  have  in  translating  their  punitive  intent  into
dollars.  Dollar  awards  are  highly  variable  despite  the  existence  of
shared moral judgments.

To  explain  why  the  use  of  the  dollar  scale  would  produce
variability,  we  explored  a  link  between  the  dollar  scale  and
psychological research on the problem of “magnitude scaling,” which
occurs  when  people  are  asked  to  assess  stimuli—the  brightness  of
lights, the loudness of noise—along an unbounded numerical  scale.34
This  research shows  a  great  deal  of  variability  in  assessments.  The
underlying problem is that people are  being  asked to scale without  a
“modulus,” that is, without a standard that would  help give meaning
to various numbers on  the  scale.35 Consider the  words of  one  of  the
subjects in the relevant experiments: “I felt freer to use numbers over
a wide range. I liked the idea that I  could just relax and contemplate
the tones.  When  there  was  a fixed standard I  felt more constrained

to  try  to  multiply  and  divide  loudnesses,  which  is  hard  to  do;  but
with  no  standard  I  could  just  place  the  tone  where  it  seemed  to
belong.”36

The key point is that when a modulus is supplied, the  variability
greatly decreases. Juries asked to assess punitive damage awards are in
effect asked to scale without a modulus. Unpredictable judgments are
a  natural  result  even  when  people  do  not  disagree  about  the
significant  issues37—even when,  that  is, there  is a kind of  “bedrock”
moral judgment in place. If this point  is correct, it helps explain the
observed variability in dollar awards in  many areas of  the  law.  It  also
helps  explain  the  disparities  that  led  to  the  enactment  of  the
Sentencing  Guidelines38;  before  the  guidelines,  judges  were  being
asked, in  effect,  to scale without  a modulus, since the  relevant  scale
(years)  has  a  great  deal  in  common  with  the  dollar  scale  (i.e.,
bounded below at zero, but with great discretion at the high end).

Our earlier  study  did  not,  however,  involve  deliberating  juries,
and a natural question is whether  deliberating juries  would  produce
similar or quite different  results.  Perhaps  deliberation  would  reduce
variability.39  In  any  case  a  test  of  deliberating  juries  would  help  to
                                                
36  See  S.S,  Stevens,  Psychophysics  37  (1975).
37  For  similar  results,  see  Michael  J.  Saks  et  al.,  Reducing  Variability  in  Civil
Jury  Awards,  Law  &  Human  Behav.,  Spring  1997,  at  243.
38  See  Sandra  Shane-DuBow  et  al.,  US  Department  of  Justice,  Sentencing
Reform in the United States (1985).
39  In  a  series  of  papers,  Michael  Saks  has  argued  that  juries  actually  reduce
variance. Saks’ research began by comparing  twelve  person  juries  to  six  person
juries, see the overview in Michael Saks, The Smaller the Jury, the  Greater  the
Unpredictability,  79  Judicature 263  (1996)—a  comparison  on  which  our  study
here does not bear. But the analysis has been extended  to  comparisons  of  juries
and judges, with the suggestion that  juries  are  likely  to  produce  less  variability
by virtue of their numbers. See Michael  Saks,  Do  We  Really  Know  Anything
About  the  Behavior  of  the  Tort  Litigation  System—and  Why  Not?  140

David L. Evans, and Allen J. Hart, 21  Law  and  Human  Behavior  243  (1997).
This  basic  conclusion  is  briefly  challenged  in  a  footnote  in  Robert  MacCoun,
Inside the black box: What empirical research tells  us  about decisionmaking  by
civil  juries,  in  Verdict:  Assessing  the  civil  jury  system  137,  178  n.  26  (Robert

confirm or deny the wisdom of the decision, for  purposes of creating
synthetic juries, to treat the median judgment of a group of twelve  as
the  likely  judgment  of  any  deliberating  group.  An  alternative
possibility, referred to in  the  introduction,  was  to assume that  there
would  be  group  polarization—that  the  process  of  collective
deliberation would  move  the  group  further  in  the  direction  of  the
initial  tendency  suggested  by  the  median  of  individual  judgments.
Hence our main purpose in  this study was  to examine the  effects of
jury deliberation on  dollar  awards  and  in  particular  to  see  whether
deliberation would  increase or decrease predictability. In  the  process
we also hoped, as a secondary goal, to find  out whether  the  original
findings—strikingly

awards—would be replicated with  a new  sample  of  citizens  from  a
different state, and with new and richer case materials.

III.  Deliberating  Juries:  An  Experimental  Inquiry

A.  Method

Jury-eligible citizens from  Phoenix,  Arizona were recruited and
paid by a survey firm. Participants  were  randomly assigned to  a  six-
person jury, and to a response mode order; some juries judged dollar
awards first and  punishment  ratings  second,  and  others  completed
the tasks in the  opposite order. Six juries (out of  a total of  480) had
only  five  members  because  an  insufficient  number  of  participants
showed up at a given appointment time. A pilot test of  29 juries was
conducted in  Phoenix  to test  the  materials  and  procedure.  Because
adjustments were  very  minor,  these  juries  were  added  to  the  main
sample and the  combined sample was  analyzed together.  Therefore,
a total of 3048 citizens participated in 509 juries.

                                                                                                               
the analogy between empaneled juries and random  samples  is  an  imperfect  one.
Thus,  it  is  a  plausible  hypothesis,  but  requires  more  rigorous  testing  than  it
has received to date.” We have attempted a more rigorous test here,  finding  that
juries  produce  more  variability  as  compared  with  the  mean  of  individual
predeliberation  judgments.  This  finding  suggests,  though  it  does  not  prove,
that  juries  will  produce  more  variability  in  awards  than  judges  (a  suggestion
supported by the  possibility  that  judicial  experience  with  a  wide  range  of  cases
will  introduce  the  equivalent  of  a  “modulus”  by  which  to  discipline  dollar
awards).

The procedure consisted of four parts. In Part  1, all participants in  a
given session  viewed  a  videotape  for  the  case  they  would  consider,
read the corresponding written materials, and recorded their personal
judgment  of  the  appropriate punitive damage award or  punishment
rating (Table 1). In Part 2, participants were  randomly assigned to a
jury of six members, and given 30 minutes to deliberate on  and reach
a unanimous  verdict on  a  punitive  damage  amount  or  a  severity  of
punishment rating.

In  Part  3,  a  new  individual  response  form  was  distributed,
which  asked  them  to  record  a  second  personal  judgment  for  the

13

same  case,  using  the  complementary  type  of  verdict  (punishment
rating  or  dollar  damages)  from  the  one  they  had  already  used.  In
Part  4, the  jury  again  deliberated  to  reach  a  unanimous  verdict  on
this  second  type  of  judgment  for  the  same  case.  Thus,  for  each
individual,  and  for  each  jury,  we  have  both  a  dollar  award  and  a
punishment rating for the case they considered.

The  stimuli consisted of  fifteen  personal  injury  scenarios.40  An
example is provided in  the  Appendix. A  videotape  was  prepared  for
each case, in which a professional actor read the  text of  the  case and
all  instructions  aloud.  To  maximize  comprehension,  participants
were  required  both  to  view  the  videotape  and  to  read  the  written
version.  Firm  size  (annual  profits  of  $100-200  million)  and
compensatory damages ($200,000) were  held  constant  for  all  cases.
Thus, the variability we observe cannot  be accounted for by a model
that depends on variability in compensatory damage awards.

B.  Results

1.  Basics
Despite the  half  hour  time limit for deliberation, 91% of  juries
reached a unanimous verdict on the punishment scale (a total of  461
verdicts) and 82% of juries reached a unanimous  verdict  on  a  dollar
amount  (a total of  416 verdicts). The  remainder had  not  reached  a
verdict when the  time limit expired; these were  treated as hung.  All
further analyses were conducted on the 401 juries that reached both a
punishment  verdict  and  a  dollar  verdict.41  Because  there  were  no
significant  differences  between  response  mode  orders  (i.e.,  dollars-
punishment  or  punishment-dollars),  we  pooled  verdicts  made  by
dollar-first 
in  our  analyses
(punishment verdicts were treated similarly).
                                                
 40  Of  these  ten  were  more  elaborate  versions  of  the  same  scenarios  used  i n
Kahneman,  Schkade  and  Sunstein.  supra,  and  five  were  completely  new
scenarios which, like the first 10, were based on real  cases  (Table  1).  The  main
substantive  elaboration  on  the  original  scenarios  was  the  addition  of  a
paragraph of closing arguments by attorneys for each side.
41  We  chose  the  more  conservative  path  of  focusing  on  juries  with  complete
responses to ensure  that  comparisons  between  punishment  and  dollar  verdicts,
and between individuals and juries, were based  on  the  same  set  of  respondents.
Recreating  our  Tables  and  Figures  with  all  available  responses  produces  the
same pattern of results, with some slight differences in exact numbers.

2. High awards way up, low awards slightly down
A view of the overall results for individuals and  juries in  Table 3
appears to show  a striking and  simple picture: juries produce  higher
dollar awards than the individuals who  compose them.  This  pattern
is  also  reflected,  to  a  lesser  degree,  in  punishment  ratings.  Higher
jury awards are not confined to the middle of the  award distribution,
and  also  show  up  clearly  in  the  extreme  low  (10th  percentile)  and
high (90th percentile) ranges of the distribution as well (Table 4).

Are Juries Less Erratic than Individuals?

This  dramatic upward shift  is indeed an  important  part  of  the
picture, but it does not tell the whole  story. A closer look at Table 3
reveals a systematic difference among  cases  in  the  degree  to  which
juries are harsher than  individuals: the  more egregious the  case,  the
greater is the margin by which  jury awards exceed individual awards.
For the five cases with the lowest  awards, individual and jury awards
are approximately equal, but for the  middle five cases jury awards are
twice as large, and for the  top five cases five times as  large.  Indeed,
on  the  punishment  scale,  deliberation  actually  causes  cases  the
bottom  five cases (those  below  the  midpoint  of  the  scale)  to  drop,
and those at or above the midpoint to rise.

As  we  will  see,  this  is  a  characteristic  response  pattern  when
group polarization is present. Thus it appears that polarization occurs
in the  underlying moral judgments,  as indicated by the  punishment
ratings, and that the effect of this shift is amplified when expressions
must be made on  the  unbounded  dollar  scale.  The  fact  that  dollar
awards  for  the  least  severe  cases  did  not  decline  is  probably  a
consequence  of  the  absolute minimum  award of  zero, below  which
awards could not  go, rather than  of  a  lack  of  a  shift  in  underlying
judgments.

A  more  direct  measure  of  polarization  can  be  computed  by
comparing  jury verdicts to the  judgments  of  the  specific  jurors  that
compose  them,  regardless  of  which  case  they  considered.  If  group
polarization is indeed occurring, we  would  expect  that  juries  whose
individuals  initially  judge  a  case  to  be  more  severe  would  more
frequently  produce  high 
the
predeliberation judgments  of individuals. The  reverse would  be  true
of  juries  whose  individuals  initially  judged  a  case  to  be  less  severe.
Note  that  this  contrast  can  happen  for  the  same  legal  case,
depending on the individual judgments jurors bring to deliberation.

jury  verdicts, 

compared 

to 

To summarize the  pre-deliberation judgments  of  jurors, we  use
three  logical benchmarks  as points of  comparison:  the  median,  the
maximum, and the minimum judgments of  the  individuals in  a jury.
A clear pattern emerges on all three of these measures, as depicted in
Figure  1.  As  a  jury’s  individuals  judge  a  defendant’s  behavior  to
deserve more severe punishment,  the  tendency  of  the  jury to exceed
the median dollar award of  its members rises rapidly, reaching  100%
at an average rating of 7 or more.

Are Juries Less Erratic than Individuals?

The  tendency  toward  extremely  high  verdicts  shows  a  similar
pattern:  the  percentage  of  jury  awards  at  or  above  the  maximum
individual  award  rises  steadily  with 
intended  severity  of
punishment,  and indeed leaps to 100% when  the  average juror is at
or  above  7  on  the  punishment  scale.  In  contrast,  the  tendency
toward  extremely  low  verdicts  shows  the  opposite  pattern:  the
percentage of jury awards at or below the minimum individual  award
declines  with  the  intended  severity  of  punishment,  and  leaps  to
100% when the average juror is below 1 on the punishment scale.

the 

As a result of  the  increased extremity produced by  polarization,
juries produce more unpredictable judgments than individuals, in  the
sense that the width of a  confidence  interval for a prospective award
is much  greater.43 Jury awards also have a  higher  standard  deviation
 = $14,118,179) than  do  the  median  awards  of  their  jurors  (s
(s
  =
$2,715,098). Contrary to the  possibility that  this  increased  variance
results  from  juries  distinguishing  more  consistently  between  cases
than individuals, this relationship holds separately for each  of  the  15
cases.  The  problem  is  less  severe  but  still  present  with 
jury
punishment ratings (s

 = 2.37) compared to individuals (s

 = 2.00).44

A important  final  question about the  increased unpredictability
is  the  extent  to  which  it  results  from  additional  random  noise
introduced  by  the  uncontrolled  vagaries  of  group  deliberation,  or
instead  from  the  systematically  higher  level  of  awards  due  to
polarization. Because dollars are a magnitude scale, which is bounded
at zero, a higher average award necessarily means a higher variance as
well. Indeed, a well understood characteristic of magnitude scales is a
high  correlation  between  the  mean  and  standard  deviation  of
responses.  To  investigate  the  source  of  the  higher  variance,  we
borrow  a  classic  analysis  from  psychophysics  research,  which  (for
those who  wish  the  skip  the  technical  details)  establishes  that  the
increased  variance  is  indeed  due  primarily  to  a  higher  mean  and
relatively little to random  deliberation noise. If  the  shift  in  the  level
of  awards  causes  most  of  the 
the
                                                
43 For example, in Table 4 an  80%  confidence  interval  for  a  jury  award  for  the
Glover  case  would  be  $1,000,000  to  $50,000,000  and  an  80%  confidence
interval for an individual award would be $50,000 to $10,000,000.
44  Thus  the  statistical  juries  analyzed  in  our  previous  study  substantially
understated the unpredictability of jury awards.

relationship between the mean and the  standard deviation of  awards
for different cases should be the same for juries and their  individuals.
As  is  expected  of  a  magnitude  scale,  the  relationship  is  strong  for
both  individuals  (R2  =  .66)  and  juries  (R2  =  .79)  and,  remarkably,
both sets of points fall on  essentially the  same regression line.45 This
strongly suggests that  the  mechanism  by which  jury awards are  less
predictable is a product not  of  irrational or erratic  deliberations,  but
rather of higher average awards, resulting from the  more orderly and
predictable process of polarization.

3.  Predictability
How  predictable are our  jury  judgments?  One  sense  in  which
jury  judgments  can  be  considered  predictable  is  if  there  is  high
agreement  between  juries  randomly  selected  from  the  population.
To  examine  this  question,  we  reprise  an  analysis  from  our  earlier
study, which simulated the convening of a separate jury for each case
on  a  given  day.  By  comparing  the  verdicts  of  different  sets  of
randomly  selected  juries  for  our  15  cases  we  can  assess  the
predictability  of  awards.46  The  correlations  in  Table  5  show  that
there  is  strong  agreement  between  sets  of  juries  when  judging
punishment (r = .69), but far less agreement  when  they judge dollar
awards  (r  =  .24).47  This  correlation  provides  a  striking  conclusion:
only  6%  of  the  variance48  in  dollar  awards  is  due  to  differences
between cases, and the remaining 94% is random  noise. In  contrast,
                                                
45 The slopes of the two regression lines are not significantly different.
46 The basic unit of this analysis is  a  set  of  15  jury  judgments  (one  for  each  of
the  15  cases),  where  one  of  the  jury  judgments  for  a  given  case  is  randomly
selected. This  procedure  simulates  the  convening  of  independent  juries  to  deal
with 15 separate cases on the same day. Using this procedure, we created 60  sets
of 15 jury  judgments  for  each  response  mode.  We  then  computed  the  Pearson
correlation  between  each  pair  of  sets.  This  computation  was  performed  both
within  response  (e.g.,  the  correlation  between  the  punishment  ratings  of
different  sets  of  15  juries)  and  across  responses  (e.g.,  the  correlation  between
the punishment rating of set of 15 juries  and  the  dollar  awards  of  another  set).
The  data  shown  in  Table  5  are  medians  of  the  1770  correlations  obtained
within  each  response  mode or  of  the  3600  correlations  obtained  between  two
response  modes.
47  Further,  the  correlation  between  different  sets  of  15  juries  responding  with
dollar  awards  is  actually  lower  than  the  correlation  between  a  set  of  juries
judging  punishment  and  another  judging  dollars.
48 The percentage of variance explained is equal to the square of the correlation.

almost  50%  of 
jury  punishment  ratings  is  accounted  for  by
differences  between  cases  which,  while  less  than  perfect,  offers  a
dramatic improvement over dollar awards.

sense  of  predictability,  one  of  great  practical

punitive intent  disagree on  a dollar award, the  similarly  situated  are
plainly treated differently. To  examine this form  of  unpredictability,
we analyze the distribution of dollar awards for juries who  agreed on
exactly the same punishment rating (Table 6). It is clear from Table

22

23

Are Juries Less Erratic than Individuals?

6 that even juries who  agree precisely on  punitive intent  vary widely
in the dollar awards they judge to be appropriate. For example, at the
most common  punishment  rating  of  4  (“Substantial”  punishment),
awards range  from  $200,000 at the  low  end (the  10th percentile) to
$5,000,000 at the high  end (the  90th percentile), and the  maximum
award (not  listed) is dramatically higher  at $100,000,000. Note  that
the  range  between  the  10th  and  90th  percentiles  for  particular
punishment  ratings  in  Table  6  are  quite  comparable  to  those  for
individual cases in Table 4. As we found for those different cases, the
greater  the  intent  to  punish,  the  more  extensive  is  the  range  of
possible awards,  as  depicted  in  Figure  2.  The  mapping  of  punitive
intent onto the magnitude scale of dollars is clearly implicated as the
source of this aspect of unpredictability, since the moral judgment,  as
well  as  the  compensatory  damages  and  firm  size,  are  all  held
constant.

4. Do  People  From  Arizona  Agree With  People  From  Texas?  The
Effects of Geography, Race, Gender, Education, Age, and Wealth
A subsidiary but nonetheless important  question is whether  the
findings  of  the  earlier study are replicated  under  the  current  study’s
changes  in  stimuli, procedure,  and  sample.  The  answer  is  that  the
previous results are replicated in  every essential respect. The  findings
in  the  Texas  study  were  replicated  in  Arizona,  despite  evident
differences between the two  regions, and  people from  the  two  areas
evaluated  cases  in  the  same  way.  As  before,  dollars  and  ratings
produce very similar rankings  of  the  cases (a rank  correlation  of  .90
compared  to  .91  in  the  previous  study).  Different  demographic
groups again produced very  similar  average  evaluations,  as  indicated
by the  extremely high  correlations  in  Table  7.  Punishment  ratings
in
also  decisively  outperformed  untransformed  dollar  awards 
distinguishing between cases (Table 8), in  the  sense that  differences
between  cases  accounted  for  only  1%  of  the  variance  in  individual
dollar awards (vs 34% for punishment  ratings) and only 10% of jury
dollar awards (vs 53%).

In  addition,  the  ordering  of  case  evaluations  closely  matches
that  in  our previous study. There  are ten  cases that  are  common  to
both  studies, and evaluations made by Texans  in  the  previous  study
are  highly  predictive  of  those  made  by  Arizonans  in  the  current
study—the  rank  correlation  between  the  two  samples  is  .90  for
punishment ratings and .98 for dollar awards. Finally, the  absence of
an  effect  of  response  mode  order  suggest  that  prior  deliberation
about a case, and even agreeing on a punishment rating, does little to
reduce  unpredictability  in  dollar  awards.  Thus,  the  current  larger

our  previous  study  that  individual  moral  judgments  are  predictable

IV.  What  Happened?
Deliberation  and  Group  Polarization

Plainly  many  of  the  509  deliberating  juries  were  subject  to
group  polarization.  Indeed,  we  believe  that  this  is  the  first
experimental  evidence  of  group  polarization  in  punitive  damage
awards.49  It  is  highly  likely  that  the  same  pattern  would  be  found

guilt  and  innocence.  See  David  Myers  and  Martin  Kaplan,  Group-Induced

with compensatory awards involving hard-to-monetize injuries, such
as  libel,  civil  rights  violations,  pain  and  suffering,  and  emotional
distress.  In  this  section,  we  provide  a  general  discussion  of  group
polarization,  both  to  explain  our  results  here  and  because  the
phenomenon, which has received no sustained attention  in  the  legal
literature, is of general interest.

A. The Basic Phenomenon

Group  polarization  is  one  of  the  most  common  patterns  of
difference  between  individual  decisions  and  deliberating  groups,50
and it has been  found  in  many  diverse tasks. Polarization “is said to
occur when an initial  tendency  of  individual group members toward
a given direction is enhanced  [by] group  discussion.”51  The  result  is

                                                                                                               
It might be tempting to suggest that  the  results  are  partly  or  largely  a  function
of  the  decision  rule,  in  this  case  unanimity.  Perhaps  the  requirement  of
unanimity  pushed  people  further  in  the  direction  of  the  dominant  view,
without  any  group  polarization,  an  idea  that  might  be  fortified  with  the
thought that those with outlier positions (in favor  of  extreme  awards)  would  be
especially  likely  to  hold  out  against  a  compromise  view,  thus  producing
pressure toward the  extremes.  In  the  abstract  it  seems  plausible  to  suggest  that
the decision rule would matter, but as an explanation  for  our  findings,  it  seems
less plausible in light of the fact that 20% of the jury judgments were as high  as
or  higher  than  that  of  the  highest  individual  judgment  pre-deliberation.  Note
also  that  numerous  studies  show  that  group  polarization  occurs  regardless  of
the  decision  rule  and  hence  it  is  extremely  unlikely  that  the  unanimity  rule
accounted  for  other  results  here:  “The  shift  effect  is  about  equally  robust
regardless  of  whether  a  group  decision  is  required.”  See  David  Myers  and
Helmut  Lamm,  The  Group  Polarization  Phenomenon,  83  Psych.  Bulletin
602,  611  (1976).  Of  course  we  cannot  exclude  the  possibility  that  the  results
would  be  somewhat  different  without  a  unanimity  rule;  this  is  in  fact  a  good
area for subsequent empirical  study,  especially  in  light  of  continuing  questions
about the consequences of requirements of jury unanimity.
50  Some  studies  suggest  that  the  median  predeliberation  judgment  is  a  good
predictor of outcomes; but in some situations groups have  indeed  been  observed
to  make  quite  different  decisions  from  those  of  the  median  or  average  of
individuals  that  compose  them  .  See  Norbert  Kerr,  Robert  MacCoun,  and
Geoffrey Kramer, Bias  in  Judgment:  Comparing  Individuals  and  Groups,  103
Psychological  Review  687  (1996);  Daniel  Gigone  and  Reid  Hastie,  Proper
Judgments.  121  Psychological

Bulletin149 (1997).

27

that  groups  often  make  more  extreme  decisions—both  higher  or
lower—than would the typical or average individual in the group.

Consider some examples. (a) A group of  moderately profeminist
women  will  be  more  strongly  profeminist  after  discussion.52  (b)
Citizens of France become more critical of  the  United States and its
intentions  with  respect  to  economic  aid.53  (c)  After  discussion,
whites  predisposed  to  show  racial  prejudice  offer  more  negative
responses  to  the  question  whether  white  racism  is  responsible  for
conditions  faced  by  African-Americans  in  American  cities.54  (d)
After  discussion,  whites  predisposed  not  to  show  racial  prejudice
offer  more  positive  responses  to  the  same  question.55  It  should
follow, for  example, that  a group moderately predisposed in  favor of
affirmative action should strongly favor it after discussion; that  those
moderately critical of  an  ongoing  war  effort  would, after discussion,
sharply oppose the war; that a group moderately predisposed to hire a
certain  job  candidate  will,  after  discussion,  support  the  application
with  considerable  enthusiasm.  The  phenomenon  has  conspicuous
importance  to the  operation of  deliberating bodies, including  juries;
but  it  has  been  barely  noticed  in  the  legal  culture.  Obviously  the
pattern  described above is exactly what  would  be  predicted  if  group
polarization were at work.56

56 There is  one  difference:  In  the  group  polarization  studies,  the  phenomenon
is  usually  defined  by  reference  to  scales  having  two  sides,  with  a  “neutral”
midpoint. This is the  arrangement  by  which  it  makes  sense  to  speak  of  initial
dispositions  and  their  aggravation.  Dollar  awards,  by  contrast,  have  no
“neutral”  midpoint.  Our  study  suggests  that  what  matters  is  the  psychological
predisposition—to increase the tendency in which the group  is  leaning—rather
that  produce
than  the  methodological  definition.  Hence 
polarization occur even in the absence of a defined midpoint. We are  grateful  to
Robert MacCoun for help with this point.

B.  Risky  Shifts,  Cautious  Shifts

Group  polarization  was  first  found  in  a  series  of  experiments
involving  risk-taking decisions.57 Before 1961, conventional  wisdom
had been  that  as compared with  the  individuals  who  compose  it,  a
group  of  decision-makers—for 
or
board—would  be  likely  to  favor  a  compromise  and  thus  to  avoid
risks. But the  relevant experiments found  otherwise;  they  identified
what  has  become  known  as  the  “risky  shift.”58  A  group  of
deliberating  people  was  more  likely  to  take  risks  than  are  the
individual members.

committee 

example 

a 

In these experiments, people were asked to assess the  probability
that  a  new  company,  for  which  some  person  A  is  considering
employment, will prove “financially sound.” Group decisions showed
is,  after
a  repeated  pattern  toward  greater  risk-taking—that 
discussion,  participants  tended  to  assess  the  likelihood  of  financial
soundness as consistently higher  than  the  median  judgment  of  the
group  predeliberation.  But  later  studies  showed  that  under  certain
conditions, it was possible to induce a “cautious shift” as well.  Where
the judgments  of individual group members were  relatively cautious,
deliberation  would  produce  a  strong  tendency  toward  greater
caution. Thus  ”a group discussion moves decisions to  more  extreme
points in the direction of the original inclination . . . , which  means
shift  to  ether  risk  or  caution  in  the  direction  of  the  original
disposition, and the size of the shift increases with  the  degree of  the
initial  polarization.”59  Similar  results  have  been  found  in  many
contexts,  involving,  for  example,  questions  about  economic  aid,
architecture, political leaders, race, feminism,  and judgments  of  guilt
or  innocence.60  The  parallel  here  is  of  course  the  increase  in  large
awards (for juries whose  members were  individually disposed in  this
direction)  and  the  decrease  in  small  awards  (for  juries  whose
members were originally so disposed).

Are Juries Less Erratic than Individuals?

C.  Two  Mechanisms

There have been  two  main  explanations for group polarization,
both  of  which  have been extensively investigated.61  Massive  support
has been found on behalf of both explanations.62

The  first  involves  social  comparison.63  On  this  view,  people
want to be  perceived favorably by other  group members (and  also to
perceive  themselves  favorably),  and  once  they  hear  what  others
believe, they adjust their positions in the  direction of  the  dominant
position. They  may want  to  signal,  for  example,  that  they  are  not
cowardly  or  cautious,  and  hence  they  will  frame  their  position  so
that  they  do  not  appear  such  by  comparison  to  other  group
members.64 The  result is to press the  group’s position toward  one  or
another extreme.

The  dynamic behind  the  social comparison explanation  is  that
most  people  may  want  to  take  a  position  of  a  certain  socially
preferred  sort—in  the  case  of  risk-taking,  for  example,  they  may
want  to be perceived (and to perceive themselves) as  moderate  risk-
takers, and their choice of  position may  be  partly  a  product  of  this

                                                
61  Isenberg,  supra,  and  Brown,  supra,  review  this  literature.  We  draw  largely
on  work  done  in  the  1970s,  because  that  was  the  period  in  which  group
polarization  was  studied  most  extensively,  and  because the  principal  findings,
for  our  purposes,  have  not  been  challenged  in  the  subsequent  literature  (with
several exceptions to be noted below).
62  Note  that  conformity  does  not  explain  group  polarization.  People  are  not
attempting  to  conform,  even  under  the  social  comparison  theory;  they  are
attempting to maintain their relative position, and the revelation of the views  of
others shifts people’s conception of what judgment is necessary to maintain  that
position.  See  Myers,  supra  note,  at  562,  indicating  that  people  “want  to
perceive  themselves  as  somewhat  different  from  others”  and  that  “people  want
to  differentiate  themselves  from  others,  to  a  small  extent  and  in  the  right
direction.”
63  There  is  an  obvious  connection  between  this  point  and  recent  work  i n
economics  on  reputational  influences  on  behavior.  See  Timur  Kuran,  Private
Truths, Public Lies (1996). Note, however, that the social comparison  approach
emphasizes  presentation  of  self  to  self,  as  well  as  self  to  others.  “By  ‘one-
upping’ the self-presentations of others, people can  see  and  peresent  themselves
as  basically  similar,  yet  desirably  distinctive.”  Myers,  supra,  at  562.
64  On  signalling  generally,  see  Eric  Posner,  Symbols,  Signals,  and  the  Law
(forthcoming 2000).

desire.65 No  one  can  know  what  such a position would  be until  the
positions  of  others  are  revealed.66  Thus  individuals  move  their
judgments in order to preserve their image to others and their image
to themselves. A key claim here is that  information  alone about the
actual positions of others—without  discussion—will produce a shift,
and evidence has confirmed this fact. Research shows that this effect
helps explain a shift toward caution (the “cautious shift”) as well.67

The  second  explanation  emphasizes  the  role  of  persuasive
arguments.68  The  key  point  here  is  that  an  individual’s  choice  or
position on  an  issue is a function  of  the  number  and  persuasiveness
of arguments presented. The choice therefore moves in the  direction
of the position held by the  most confident  and outspoken members
of  the  group. Because a group that  is inclined  in  a certain  direction
will  have  a  disproportionate  number  of  arguments  supporting  that
direction, the result of  discussion will  be to move individuals further
in the direction of their initial inclinations.

The persuasive arguments theory begins with  the  intuition  that
if a group is deliberating about some difficult question with  a factual
answer  (how  many  countries  are  there  in  Africa,  for  example),
discussion will  produce some movement,  not  toward  the  mean,  but
toward  the  minority  view  on  which  one  or  a  few  members  have
                                                
65  For  a  quite  vivid  demonstration  of  such  a  process  in  the  enactment  of  the
Clean Air Act, one that does not, however, identify the  mechanisms,  discussed
here,  see  Bruce  Ackerman,  John  Millian,  and  Donald  Elliott,  Toward  a
Theory  of  Statutory  Evolution:  The  Federalization  of  Environmental  Law,  1  J.

66 “Once the real  locations  of  the  mean  was  known,  should  it  not  be  the  case,
granting  that  everyone  wanted  to  see  himself  as  reasonably  audacious,  that
those  who  were  really  below  the  mean  would  be  motivated  to  adopt  riskier
positions and so change the mean  and  produce  the  risky  shift?”  Brown,  supra,
at 214.
67  Investigations  of  social  influence  have  emphasized  both  one-upmanship  and
the  removal  of  pluralistic  ignorance,  that  is,  ignorance  of  what  other  people
think  (or  are  willing  to  say  they  think).  Note  that  it  is  implicit  in  these
findings  that  people  seem  to  want  not  to  conform,  but  to  be  different  from
others in a desirable way. “To be virtuous . . .  is  to  be  different  from  the  mean
– in the right direction and to the right degree.” Brown, supra note, at 469.
68  There  is  an  obvious  connection  between  this  theory  and  recent  work  i n
economics  on  informational  influences  on  behavior  and  in  particular  on
information cascades. See David Hirchleifer, The Blind Leading The Blind,  i n
The New Economics of Human Behavior (1997).

accurate  information.  Of  course  many  of  the  questions  involving
group  polarization  do  not  have  purely  factual  answers.  But  a  key
aspect of those discussions is that the person with the  correct answer
is likely to state his view with  a high  degree of confidence,  and also
be  able  to  make  some  argument  in  favor  of  that  view.  Novel
arguments,  bringing  up  fresh  points,  are  especially  likely  to  be
persuasive.  Thus  it  is  suggested  that  the  “important  thing  that
happens in discussion is that  individual arguments  are expressed and
become fully shared.”69

When people hear arguments that they perceive as valid, or find
to  be  new,  they  will  shift  in  the  direction  suggested  by  those
arguments.  Discussion produces larger “argument  pools.” If  a  group
of  moderately  feminist  women  become  more  feminist,  a  group
moderately opposed to gun  control  more extremely so, and so forth,
the  reason  is  that  the  “argument  pool”  of  any  such  group  will
contain  a  preponderance  of  arguments  in  the  direction  suggested.
Once  the  set  of  individual  arguments  is  exposed  to  all  individual
members,  there  will  be  an  inclination  in  the  direction  of  initial
inclinations,  but  more  extremely  and  intensely  so.  ”Because  the
choice  dilemmas  have  total  argument  pools  in  which  the  balance
favors  either  risk  or  caution,  the  larger  sample  of  the  pool  made
available  to  all  in  discussion  will  produce  either  a  risky  shift  or  a
cautius shift  according to the  direction of prediscussion  inclinations
as revealed in the means of initial decisions.”70 The  suggestion is that
group polarization will occur when  convincing  arguments produce a
shift  in  the  direction  of  prediscussion  inclinations,  revealed  in  the
means  of  the  initial  decisions.  At  the  same  time,  the  persuasive
arguments  theory suggests that  there  will  be “depolarization”  if  and
when new  persuasive arguments  are offered that  are opposite to the
direction initially favored  by  group  members,  and  there  is  evidence
for this phenomenon as well. 71

71  A  third  possibility  is  that  hearing  other  similar  opinions  produces  greater
confidence  in  individual  positions,  opening  members  to  a  more  extreme
judgment  in  the  same  direction.  raised  recently  by  Heath  and  Gonzales  .  See

Of  course it is not  the  case  that  all  groups  polarize.  There  are
two  qualifications  to  the  claims  made  thus  far.  First,  these  are
statistical  regularities,  and  some  groups  will  not  polarize  at  all,  a
statement confirmed by many individual juries in  our study. Second,
depolarization,  rather  than  polarization,  will  be  found  when  the
relevant  group  consists  of  individuals  drawn  equally  from  two
extremes.72  Thus  if  people  who  initially  favor  caution  are  put
together  with  people  who  initially  favor  risk-taking,  the  group
judgment will  move toward  the  middle. It  is remarkable, then,  that
despite  the  presence  of  some  groups  who  did  the  opposite,  the
groups in our study who did polarize were numerous enough to cause
the aggregate pattern of our results to mimic polarization.

V.  Implications  and  Reforms

A. Is There A Problem? What Kind of Problem?

The  group  polarization  phenomenon  (and  other  evidence
involving  group  performance)  raises  questions  about  the  common
belief  that  groups,  and  in  particular  juries,  generally  make  better
decisions than individuals. The  common  belief does seem sensible if
only  because  the  averaging  of  multiple  judgments  should  reduce
errors  and  variance—even  if  group  deliberation  has  no  effect  on
individual  judgments.73  But  a  now  considerable  literature,  using  a
wide  variety  of  tasks,  concludes  that  deliberating  groups  hold  no
generalized  advantage  over  individuals  in  the  performance  of
judgment tasks.74

More specifically, a review of judgmental biases in  legal contexts
suggests  that  jury  deliberations  are  actually  slightly  more  likely  to
amplify the biases of  individuals than  to attenuate  them.75 Indeed, a
series of studies involving juries suggests that  in  a variety of  contexts,

Are Juries Less Erratic than Individuals?

jury judgments  are likely to be  more  erratic  than  the  judgments  of
(the  mean  or  median  of  a  group  of  the  same  number  of)
individuals.76 The  simplest conclusion  from  our study here is that  to
the  extent  that  there  is  a  concern  about  unpredictable  damage
awards, deliberation  is  not  likely  to  alleviate  that  concern.  On  the
contrary,  deliberations  increase  unpredictability  in  the  particular
sense  that  the  dollar  judgment  of  one  group  of  six  (or  twelve)  is
highly unlikely to predict the dollar judgment of another group of six
(or twelve)—in  fact  it is less likely to  predict  that  judgment  that  it
would if the group judgment were based on the median judgment  of
the individual members.77

Unpredictability is a serious problem  for  jury  judgments,  partly
because  it  ensures  that  the  similarly  situated  will  not  be  treated
similarly (and  thus  produces unfairness for plaintiffs and defendants
alike),  partly  because  it  may  produce  overdeterrence  in  risk-averse
defendants,  partly  because  of  the  sheer  cost  involved  in  litigation-
related expenses. But unpredictable  awards  might  be  worthwhile  if
many or most of  them  are sound; predictable awards are nothing  to

                                                
76In  the  jury  damage  assessment  context,  Diamond  and  Casper’s  (1992)  mock
jury  awards  were  significantly  higher  than  the  mean  individual  award  (by
26%).  See  Shari  Diamond  and  Jonathan  Casper,  Blindfolding  the  Jury  to
Verdict  Consequences:  Damages,  Experts,  and  the  Civil  Jury,  26  Law  and
Society Review 513-563 (1992). This finding  is  mirrored  qualitatively  in  other
studies,  see  James  H.  Davis,  Group  Decision  Making  and  Quantitative
in  Understanding  Group  Behavior:
Judgments:  A  Consensus  Model, 
Consensual  Action  by  Small  Groups  (E.  Witte  and  J.  Davis  eds.  1996);
Martin  Kaplan  and  Charles  Miller,  Group  Decision  Making  and  Normative
Versus  Informational  Influence:  Effects  of  Type  of  Issue  and  Assigned
Decision Rule, 53 Journal of Personality and Social Psychology  306  (1987) (for
compensatory  but  not  punitive  damages).  If  this  general  trend  applies  to  our
previous  study,  see  Sunstein,  Kahneman,  and  Schakde,  supra,  at  2100-2104,
then  the  synthetic,  statistical  “juries”  analyzed  there  will  have  underestimated
both  the  mean  and  the  variance  of  the  awards  that  deliberating  juries  would
have made.  Consistent  with  this  conjecture,  Gigone  and  Hastie,  supra,  found
that group judgments have higher error variances than the  average  judgment  of
group members.
77  Note  also  that  because our  study  stipulated  compensatory  damages,  and  held
them fixed across cases, we may well have  understated  true  variance  in  punitive
awards,  because  according  to  previous  research,  see  Eisenberg,  supra  note;
Karpoff  and  Lott,  supra  note,  real  juries  anchor  on  their  own  compensatory
award, rather than into some constant value

Chicago Working Paper in Law and Economics

celebrate  if  they  are  invariably  too  low  or  too  high.  Indeed,  it  is
possible  that  the  deterrent  signal  created  by  a  range  of  variable
awards, including a number  of very high  awards, is better, from  the
standpoint  of  preventing  undesirable conduct,  than  the  comparable
signal  of  any  realistic  alternative.78  There  is  thus  an  important
remaining  question:  whether  jury  deliberation,  including  group
polarization,  produces  a  better  deterrent  signal  or  more  accurate
judgments than alternative arrangements.

It is certainly possible that the median judgment of a set of (say)
100 deliberating juries is more accurate than  the  median  judgments
of  (say) 600 individuals.  Without  an  independent  account  of  good
outcomes,  in  this  contested  area  of  the  law,  this  possibility  is  very
hard  to  assess.79  But  an  understanding  of  the  mechanisms  that
underlie group polarization certainly does not  give  much  reason  for
optimism, at least in  the  context  of  damage  awards.  To  the  extent
that  polarization occurs as a result of  social comparison,  there  is  no
reason to think  that  the  higher  and  lower  post-deliberative  awards
are  better  (or  for  that  matter  worse)  than  the  lower  and  higher
median  of  pre-deliberative  individual  judgments.  When  social
comparison  helps  generate  both  larger  and  smaller  awards,  no
is  producing  improved  judgments.80  The
relevant  information 
increased  unpredictability  caused  by  polarization,  however,  is  still
present and problematic, even if the means are no more or less valid.
To  the  extent  that  polarization  occurs  as  a  result  of  persuasive
arguments,  there  might  appear  to  be  more  reason  to  believe  that
group  discussion  produces  better,  more  informed  outcomes.  Recall
that with  respect to purely factual questions on  which  one  or a few

                                                
78 Cf. Galanter and Luban, supra note.
79  Compare  the  interesting  claim  that  there  is  a  “leniency  shift”  in  criminal
juries  and  that  this  shift  produces  more  accurate  judgments,  because juries  are
more  likely  than  individual  jurors  to  apply  the  reasonable  doubt  standard
correctly.  See  Robert  MacCoun  and  Norbert  Kerr,  Asymmetric  Influence  i n
Mock  Jury  Deliberation:  Jurors’  Bias  for  Leniency,  54  J  Persononality  and
Social  Psych.  21  (1988).  There  is  no  obvious  analogy  here,  because  it  is  not
easy  to  find  a  legal  standard  against  which  to  evaluate  the  increase  in  large
awards and the decrease in small awards.
80  To  be  sure,  discussion  does  dissipate  pluralistic  ignorance,  by  showing
people  what  others  think;  but  this  is  hardly  a  guarantor  of  better  outcomes,
whatever may be our criteria for defining them.

35

Are Juries Less Erratic than Individuals?

group members have expertise, people are pushed  toward  a  (correct)
minority view  simply  because  one  or  a  few  members  of  the  group
actually know  the  right  answer.81 But it is not  at all clear that  there
is  an  analogy  in  the  context  of  punitive  damage  awards.  In  this
setting, arguments that turn out  to be persuasive may or may not  be
sound.  This  is  especially  so  in  light  of  the  pervasive  problem  of
“scaling without a modulus.” Even those with convincing  arguments
are likely not  to have a good  reason  to  favor  one  or  another  dollar
figure (which  is not  to say that  their numbers  are worse than  those
of anyone else), We conclude that the fact that  high  awards become
higher,  and  low  awards  become  lower,  should  not  be  seen  as  a
tribute  to  the  power  of  deliberation  to  lead  people  in  better
directions—though  aside 
the  problem  of
unpredictability, it may not lead them in worse directions either.

from  exacerbating 

B. Reform Proposals

With  respect to punitive  damage  awards,  and  damages  awards
in  related areas, many  proposals have been  motivated  by  a  desire  to
decrease unpredictability. This goal has, for example, played a role in
proposals  for  damage  caps,  for  simple  multipliers  (relating  punitive
awards  to  compensatory  awards),  and  for  informing  the  jury  of
average awards or of  intervals.82 It  has played a role in  constitutional
limitations as well.83 The desire to reduce unpredictability motivation
our discussion of the  possibility of eliciting from  the  jury  not  dollar
awards,  but  normative  judgments  on  a  bounded  numerical  scale.84
These  judgments  might  be  converted  into  a  dollar  award  through
some  kind  of  calibration  function,  based  on  experts  (“technocratic
populism”) or on population-wide data relating normative judgments
to dollar awards (“predictable populism”).85 Of  course it is possible to
question whether  it is practical to ask a deliberating  jury  to  make  a
moral judgment  on  a  bounded  numerical  scale,  hardly  an  ordinary
practice in  daily life, and indeed a task that  might  seem  even  odder

than  the  somewhat  more  familiar  one  of  punishing  wrongdoers
through dollar awards.

The  findings  here do not  lead directly to any particular  reform
proposal86; but they  add  two  points  to  the  existing  literature.  First,
they  demonstrate  that  juries  can  use  a  bounded  punishment  scale
reliably. Juries are able to answer the normative question directly, and
they  are also able to use a bounded numerical scale far more  reliably
than  the  familiar dollar scale. And  if deliberating juries are  thought
to  have  advantages  over  other,  less  populist  institutions—as  many
people  clearly  believe87—then  there  is  reason  to  consider  a  reform
proposal  that  would  involve  directly  eliciting  the 
jury’s  moral
judgment.  As  noted,  these  judgments  might  be  converted  into  a
dollar award by some kind of  calibration formula, defined  by  expert
judgments  about what  different dollar awards would  mean  or do to
particular  defendants,  or  instead  on  population-wide  data  relating
normative  judgments  to  dollar  awards.  Either  route  would  greatly
diminish unpredictability.88 The  data here, along  with  previous data,
show that a calibration formula is also feasible to develop and use.89

The  second  point  stems  from  the  finding  that  deliberating
juries do not  reduce  erratic  awards,  and  indeed  that  the  process  of
deliberation is one  of  the  causes  of  unpredictability.  We  have  seen
that  deliberation  can  even  produce  “runaway  juries,”  if  these  are
understood as juries in  which  group  discussion  yields  awards  much
higher  than  those of  even the  highest  of  pre-discussion  judgments.
Such  juries  can  be  produced  even  in  a  mock  jury  task.  Thus  our
findings  fortify the  suggestion that  difficulties with  the  dollar  scale
make  it  hazardous  to  continue  to  rely  on  the  current  system,  in
which  juries  must  map  their  moral  judgments  onto  that  scale
without being given any  guidance about the  meaning  of  the various
“points” on the scale.
                                                
86  They  do  suggest,  somewhat  amusingly,  a  simple  way 
to  promote
predictability:  Do  not  allow  jurors  to  deliberate,  and  simply  take  the  mean  of
their  individual  damage  judgments!  We  do  not  discuss  this  alternative,
however, because it is so foreign to our traditions,  and  also  because a  great  deal
of  unpredictability  would  remain,  as  suggested  by  our  data  here,  see  Table  4,
and see also SKS at 2100-2104.

37

Are Juries Less Erratic than Individuals?

To be sure, eliciting moral judgments  rather than  dollar awards
would  not  answer  all  of  the  relevant  questions,  because  group
polarization also produces not  only higher  and  lower  dollar  awards,
but  also  higher  and  lower  moral  judgments.  There  is  no  reason,
however,  to  think  that  the  resulting  “verdicts”  are  worse  than  the
mean  of  individual judgments  before  discussion,  just  as  there  is  no
reason  to  think  that  they  are  better  (except  that 
increased
unpredictability is unambiguously worse in  itself). In  the  absence of
an  independent  criterion  of  rightness,  it  probably  makes  sense  to
continue  the  tradition  of  obtaining  the  deliberative  judgment,
without at the  same time creating  the  forms of  unpredictability and
unfairness that can come from the unbounded dollar scale.

The  most  radical  reform  would  be  to  dispense  with  the  jury
entirely and to move toward  judicial judgments  or even to develop a
kind  of  penalty  schedule,  based  on  the 
judgments  of  some
combination  of  representative  and  expert  institutions.90  We  cannot
evaluate  these  alternatives  here.  But  to  the  extent  that  our  study
shows  both  decreasing  and  increasing  awards  as  a  result  of  group
polarization, operating independently of  better-informed  or sounder
judgments  of  any kind, it supplies additional  support  for  that  more
radical reform. Of course the  radical reform might  be rejected if the
relevant 
institutions  would  be  unreliable,  perhaps  because
bureaucracies  might  be  vulnerable  to  the  exercise  of  politically
powerful  private  groups.  The  question  is  one  of  comparative
institutional  competence.  What  we  have  added  here  is  that  the
process of  deliberation will  increase  high  awards  and  diminish  low
awards, a result that  cannot  be comforting  in  light  of  the  increased
unpredictability  and  the  pervasive  problem  of  scaling  without  a
modulus.

                                                
90  The  idea  has  received  considerable  attention  in  the  analogous  area  of
contingent valuation. See  Murray  Rutherford  et al.,  Assessing  Environmental
Losses:  Judgments  of  Importance  and  Damage Schedules,  22  Harv.  Envtl.  L.

Analyzing  Superfund  219,  241-44  (Richard  L.  Revesz  and  Richard  B.  Stewart

schedules in Bovbjerg et al., supra. In the punitive damage context,  see Viscusi,

damages generally, see Atiyah, supra note.

VI. Conclusion

We have found that as compared with the  median of individual
judgments,  deliberation  substantially  increases  group  polarization:
Small  awards  become 
large  awards  become
smaller,  and 
(significantly) larger. The  point  has implications for damage awards
in  general and  also for understanding  social  deliberation.  From  the
normative point  of  view, it  is  hard  to  know  whether  the  resulting
judgments  are better than  the  median  of  pre-deliberative  individual
judgments. But four points seem clear. First, moral judgments  about
personal injury cases are very widely shared over diverse communities
and demographic categories. Second,  those shared moral judgments
do not  produce predictable dollar awards.  Third,  group  polarization
occurs, in a quite dramatic fashion, in the context of  damage awards.
Hence  both  social  influence  and  persuasive  arguments  drive  group
judgments to more extreme points in the direction of the  inclination
originally  indicated  by  the  median  of  pre-deliberation  judgments.
Fourth, the  problem of  unpredictable and erratic judgments  is  likely
to  be  aggravated,  rather  than  alleviated,  by  virtue  of  the  fact  that
juries are deliberative bodies.

Appendix

Glover v. General Assistance

Joan  Glover, a five-year-old child, ingested a large number  of  a
non-prescription  allergy  medicine  called  Allerfree,  and  required  a
three-week  hospital  stay.  The  Allerfree  bottle  used  a  faulty
childproof  safety  cap.  The  Glovers  sued  the  manufacturer  of
Allerfree,  the  General  Assistance  company.  The  trial  jury  ordered
General  Assistance  to  pay  the  Glovers  $200,000  in  compensatory
damages.

Facts of the Case Established at Trial

testified 

Joan’s  parents 

that  after  her  birth 

they  had
“childproofed” their house and ensured that  all of  their  medications
had childproof safety caps. The Allerfree bottle carries a label reading
“Childproof  Cap.”  Joan  found  the  pills  in  a  kitchen  drawer  and
ingested  most  of  the  bottle.  The  overdose  permanently  weakened
her  respiratory  system,  which  will  make  her  more  susceptible  to
breathing-related  diseases  such  as  asthma  and  emphysema  for  the
rest of her life.

General Assistance is a large company (with profits of  $100-200
million  per  year)  that  manufactures  a  variety  of  non-prescription
medicines.  The  company  has  sold  tens  of  thousands  of  bottles  of
medicines with  childproof safety  caps  that  were  generally  effective,
but had a failure rate much  higher  than  any others in  the  industry.
Internal  company  documents  showed  that  General  Assistance  had
chosen  to ignore  federal  regulations  requiring  more  effective  safety
caps.  An  internal  memo  presented  at  trial  says  that  “this  stupid,
it
unnecessary  federal  regulation  is  a  waste  of  our  money”; 
acknowledges the risk that Allerfree might be punished for violating
the regulation but says “the punishments are extremely mild; basically
we’d be asked to improve the safety caps in the future.” An  official at
the Food and Drug Administration had previously warned a General
Assistance executive that the company was “on shaky ground  on  this
one.”

Closing Argument by Glovers’ Attorney

The  attorney for the  Glovers  argued  that  General  Assistance’s
disregard  for  children’s  safety  and  for  the  law  was  abhorrent  and
represented exactly the kind of reckless corporate greed deserving of  a
high  award  of  punitive  damages.  He  concluded  that  General
Assistance’s shocking  profit-mongering  should be  punished  so  that
the company would not feel itself at liberty to put children  at risk in
the future.

Closing Argument by General Assistance’s Attorney

The attorney for General Assistance emphasized that  while  the
cap had a high  failure rate relative  to  others  on  the  market,  it  had
nonetheless been conceded at trial that the cap was  effective in  most
cases.  She  argued  that,  given  that  the  FDA  official  had  only
communicated to  them  verbally, and had not  required the  company
to take any action, it was not at all clear that  the  cap was  actually in
violation of the regulation at all.
