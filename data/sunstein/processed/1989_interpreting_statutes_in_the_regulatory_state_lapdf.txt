INTERPRETING STATUTES IN THE REGULATORY STATE
Cass R. Sunstein*
the early part of the twentieth century, courts often treated Iregulatory statutes as foreign substances. Starting from principles of laissez-faire, judges saw statutory protections of workers, consumers, and others as unprincipled interest-group transfers supported by theories that were at best obscure and often disingenuous. By contrast, judge-made doctrines of property, contract, and tort seemed to create a system with integrity and coherence.
The role of the courts in this period was one of damage control. The most important organizing principle for interpretation was that regulatory statutes should be construed narrowly - so as to harmonize as much as possible with principles of private markets and private rights. This approach grew out of the idea that courts should narrowly construe statutes in derogation of the common
The New Deal period marked an enormous change in the size and character of the national government. The decade between 193o and
recent suggestions that courts should indulge a presumption in favor of private ordering and should interpret regulatory statutes so as to intrude minimally on the private market. The nineteenth-century view that regulatory statutes should be viewed against a background of common law property and contract rights and hence as naked wealth transfers also finds a modern home, in the increasingly prominent idea that statutes should be seen as unprincipled "deals" among self-interested private actors. Similarly, those who emphasize the findings of public choice theory would treat statutes as lacking coherent normative underpinnings. '
The initial judicial skepticism about the legitimacy and' coherence of statutory law is also recalled by both poles of the contemporary debate over the possibility of constrained or objective legal interpretation. At one extreme, some courts and observers see the text or "plain meaning" of statutory language as the exclusive or principal guide to meaning. At the opposite extreme, other commentators claim that legal terms are quite generally indeterminate or have the meaning that those with authority choose to impose on them.' Despite their differences, the two camps share a number of assumptions. Both treat regulatory statutes as an undifferentiated and unprincipled whole, without distinct and accessible purposes. Because members of both camps see no way to mediate the sharp ideological disagreements that sometimes underlie interpretive disputes, some are driven to the
pretense that words quite generally have "plain meanings," others to to the demonstrably false claim that statutes are usually indeterminate
statutory interpretation, in and out of the judiciary, often dissolve plied by language "itself" (as if such a thing could be imagined).
not only sheds light on current practices but also might claim to be set out the proper relationships among the traditional sources of inlarge part of the solution, however, lies in the identification and
ciples. Courts sometimes make the governing norms explicit, but frequently leave them unarticulated and latent. The principles are often misdirected or at least controversial.
In these circumstances, it is important to identify the prevailing principles and to subject them to scrutiny. The ultimate task is to develop norms of statutory interpretation that grow out of, and do not collide with, the basic purposes of the constitutional framework, of contemporary institutional arrangements, and of modern social and economic regulation. Above all, it is important to develop principles that improve the performance of modern government, and that are not based on pre-New Deal understandings, which seem to have overstayed their welcome.
To carry out this task, it will be necessary to develop distinctive understandings about both the nature of legal interpretation and the character of modern public law. Because interpretation is a function of background norms and cannot proceed without them, theories about statutory "meaning" cannot be separated from theories about how the modern regulatory state does and should operate. When interpretive norms are contested, and when neither the Constitution nor the Congress has specified the proper norms, there is no alternative but to base the inevitably value-laden choice among them on their role in improving or impairing governmental performance.
In the course of the discussion, I reject a number of generally accepted understandings about statutory construction:
o courts must always adhere to the original meaning of the statute,
or the original intent of the enacting legislature
o courts are or can be mere agents of the Congress
o statutory meaning remains constant over time
o statutory meaning is equivalent to legislative intent
o controversial views about public policy are never and should
never be part of statutory construction
o canons of construction, or background interpretive norms, are
an outmoded and unhelpful guide to the courts. All of these aspects of the conventional wisdom, I suggest, are inconsistent with actual judicial behavior. Moreover, they provide incomplete instructions and often produce perverse results.
The discussion proceeds in three stages. Part II rejects the usual understandings of how courts do and should construe statutes. It also suggests the proper uses of the traditional sources of interpretation: text, structure, purpose, congressional intent, and legislative history. The recent emphasis on the primacy of the text is a step in the right direction, but structure, purpose, intent, and history sometimes help
to clarify ambiguities or to prevent unnecessary or unintended irrationality and injustice. I also suggest that the traditional sources offer incomplete guidance and that their incompleteness reveals the inevitable failure of the agency conception of the judicial role. At the same time, I reject the view that statutory disputes produce "indeterminacy" in most or all cases and the related idea that such disputes are resolved on the basis of conventions that are not subject to evaluation. Finally, I criticize, though on quite different grounds, the use of certain widelyheld extratextual norms to resolve statutory disputes: private autonomy, deference to agency interpretations, and conceptions of statutes as "deals."
Part Ill attempts to understand statutory construction by means of a general defense of the much-maligned "canons" of construction, understood as background principles designed to help discern statutory meaning. I defend the use of such principles by disaggregating their various functions and by suggesting that the use of background norms is desirable and in any case inevitable. I also suggest that several current substantive norms can be supported through an understanding of the ways in which they incorporate constitutional principles, promote deliberation in government, and respond to New Deal reforms of the legal system.
Part IV proposes a series of interpretive principles for judicial adoption in the regulatory state. I argue that many such principles, whether existing in current law or proposed here, can be defended by reference to constitutional norms that others are based on assessments of the performance of various governmental institutions and that still others are an effort to counteract some of the failings in regulatory systems. A general purpose of Part IV is to describe and defend principles that will serve the purposes of deliberative government and, in particular, will alleviate rather than aggravate the defects in modern regulatory programs.
Although these suggestions are designed principally for reviewing courts in hard cases, their implications extend to administrative agencies attempting to implement statutes, and to Congress in its efforts to design and reform social and economic regulation. Debates over statutory meaning are often disputes over interpretive principles these debates reflect broader divisions over the nature and performance of the regulatory state and, indeed, about the character of American democracy and constitutionalism as a whole.
In the conventional account, the tools of statutory construction are language, structure, and history. The weight of each of these has been sharply contested, especially in recent years. Disputes over questions of this sort have produced a range of approaches to statutory construction, all with support in the case law. Each, however, is flawed. My purpose here is to explain how these approaches fail, both as positive accounts of how courts in fact approach statutes and as normative theories of interpretation.
This Part is divided into three sections. The first deals with theories that see courts as agents of the legislature and that charge courts with the duty to implement legislative decisions. These theories fail because they ignore the inevitable use of interpretive principles in the process of construction. Arguing that it is possible to choose among interpretive principles, the second section rejects both conventionalist accounts of meaning and the view that statutory interpretation produces "indeterminacy. The third section considers three prominent approaches that do invoke supplemental principles it suggests that these approaches also fail, largely because the relevant principles are difficult to defend.
A. Courts As Agents According to the most prominent conception of the role of courts in statutory construction, judges are agents or servants of the legislature. On the agency view, courts should say what the statute means, relying on its language, structure, and history. Background norms, policy considerations, indeed all "outside sources," are immaterial. The judicial task is to discern and apply a judgment made by others, most notably the legislature.
The agency view is usually defended by a claim of judicial legitimacy.2 In a democratic system, with an electorally accountable legislature and separated powers, it is said to be the appropriate and indeed constitutionally prescribed role of the courts to apply legislative commands it is thus impermissible for them to invoke considerations that cannot be traced to an authoritative text. The claim of illegitimacy is buttressed by (and perhaps reducible to) a range of prudential considerations: the use of outside sources will tend to increase judicial discretion, decrease legislative attentiveness, produce uncertainty, and risk usurpation by judges of powers reserved for legislative and executive actors. Justice Holmes provided a particularly crisp expression of the agency view: after describing a regulatory statute as "foolish," he added, "if my fellow citizens want to go to Hell I will help them. It's my job."
The agency view appears in several competing forms, and much of the history of statutory construction consists of shifts and disputes among the various possible sources of the instructions of the courts' "principal," the legislature. I discuss several variations here.
i. Textualism. It is sometimes suggested that statutory language is the source of judicial power and the only legitimate object of judicial concern. Textualism appears to be enjoying a renaissance in a number of recent cases, and perhaps in the academy as
well, partly because of dissatisfaction with alternative interpretive strategies, taken up below, which counsel courts to rely on "purpose" or to produce "reason" in regulatory regimes.
Several considerations argue in favor of textualist strategies. First, textualism contains an important and often overlooked truth. Statutory terms are the enactment of the democratically elected legislature and represent the relevant "law." Statutory terms not legislative history, not legislative purpose, not legislative "intent" - have gone through the constitutionally specified procedures for the enactment of law. Second, resort to the text promotes goals associated with the rule of law: citizens have access to the statutory words and can most readily order their affairs in response to those words. Third, the words of a statute, considered in light of widely shared conventions about how they should be understood, often have only one plausible interpretation, or at least sharply constrain the territory of legitimate disagreement. Finally, an emphasis on the primacy of the text serves as a salutary warning about the potential abuses of judicial use of statutory "purpose" and of legislative history.
Some textualists emphasize the "plain meaning" or dictionary definition of statutory terms others are more sensitive to the particular settings. In its purest form, however, the textualist approach is inadequate. The central problem is that the meaning of words (whether "plain" or not) depends on both culture and context. Statutory terms are not self-defining, and words have no meaning before or without interpretation. To say this is emphatically not to say that words
Usually the context does not prevent reliance on ordinary meaning, example, that Congress is speaking in English, that Congress is not
tort law is an easy one, not because of the statutory text "itself," but
Those who accept textualist approaches might agree that the meaning of words is partly a function of the context and of background norms about how texts should be approached. Indeed, we may define an easy case as one in which the context produces no dispute and there is a consensus about the governing norms. In many hard cases, however, the source of the difficulty is that the particular background norm and the nature of its application will be highly controversial. Textualism or "plain meaning" approaches can resolve these questions only by covertly introducing background principles, which are often controversial.
Consider the question whether a statute creating a regulatory agency to police racial discrimination in employment implicitly authorizes victims of discrimination to bring private suits against employers who allegedly have engaged in discrimination. If the statute and its history do not resolve the question, the introduction of background norms is necessary to discern the meaning of the statute. It should thus be unsurprising that judges skeptical about implied causes of action have relied not on statutory "text" but instead on a highly controversial background assumption, traceable to a particular, contestable understanding of separation of powers, that only the legislature may create such rights, and that statutory silence should be assumed not to do 38 Without that assumption or a different one, statutory silence on the existence of an implied cause of action has no meaning.
Background norms are ubiquitous in any legal system, and indeed in grammar itself they are necessary to make reliance on "text" an intelligible concept. These considerations account for the pervasive difficulties with textualist approaches to statutory construction: ambiguity or vagueness, overinclusiveness, underinclusiveness, delegation or gap-filling, and changed circumstances.
(a) Ambiguity or Vagueness. - The most familiar problem with textualism is that statutory language is sometimes ambiguous or vague. To say that courts should rely on the words or on their
statutory words have more than one dictionary definition, or when the context produces interpretive doubt. It is not clear, for example, whether the term "feasible" contemplates a cost-benefit analysis, or whether a prohibition of "discrimination" bars voluntary race-conscious measures designed to counteract the effects of past and present discrimination against blacks. In both of these cases, moreover, it is uncertain whether the language should be taken to refer to the original meaning of those words for the enacting legislature (assuming that idea can be made intelligible in light of the problems of aggregating the views of numerous actors) or should instead take account of contemporary understandings of what the words mean. Indeed, it is not even clear what bearing the desires, or interpretive instructions, of the enacting legislature should have for judicial interpretation. By itself, textualism cannot answer these questions. Nor can the agency conception of the judicial role resolve such problems.
(b) Overinclusiveness.40 - If textualism is taken, as it often is, to call for reliance on the literal4 language of statutory words - their dictionary definition or meaning in ordinary settings - it will sometimes suggest an outcome that makes little or no sense. For example, suppose that a state law says that no vehicles are permitted in public parks, and a city proposes to build in a park a monument consisting of tanks used in World War The literal language must yield, for the statute could not reasonably be taken to forbid a monument, which causes none of the harms the statute could be thought to prevent.
A passage from Wittgenstein indicates the basic difficulty: "Someone says to me: 'Shew the children a game.' I teach them gaming with dice, and the other says 'I didn't mean that sort of game.' Must the exclusion of the game with dice have come before his mind when he gave me the order?" The example shows that sometimes the best interpretation of a textual command is one that runs counter to its apparent literal meaning - even if the author did not have in mind the case at issue, or make a judgment about how that case should be resolved.
Courts encounter the problem of overinclusiveness frequently. The Supreme Court recently held that a statute exempting state and local public housing obligations "from allt taxation . . . imposed by the United States" should not be interpreted to include an exemption from federal estate tax. The Court held that the exemption did not mean what it appeared to say in light of the contemporaneous understanding that an excise tax was not ordinarily comprehended within the category of "taxation. As another example, suppose that the legislature has said that an employer may discharge an employee "for any reason." Is the employer thereby authorized to fire workers who have refused to commit crimes on his behalf ? If a state law says that one spouse will inherit from another "in all circumstances," may a husband who has murdered his wife make a claim against the estate? These are examples of what might be described as the overinclusiveness of a prominent version of textualism:48 the possibility that statutory language, read without sufficient regard to context or its intended field of application, will reach situations that it could not reasonably cover.
(c) Underinclusiveness. - Although it arises less frequently, there is also a possibility that textualism will be underinclusive. Justice Holmes warned that "[c]ourts are apt to err by sticking too closely to the words of a law where those words import a policy that goes beyond them."'49 A particular difficulty here is that a statute may be
"evaded" by private ingenuity. The literal language of the statute does not cover the situation, but because the private conduct causes all of the harms that the statute could be thought to prevent, courts sometimes hold a statute applicable notwithstanding its literal terms. The problem of evasion should not be an excuse for judicial stretching of statutes (to be sure, a most ill-defined concept in this setting), but the problem has elicited judicial responses in a number of areas, most notably taxation. '
(d) Delegation, Gaps, and Implementing Rules. - The incompleteness of textualism is most conspicuous when Congress has explicitly or implicitly delegated lawmaking power to the courts or when Congress has simply left a gap. In cases of delegated power or gap-filing, the problem is not that words are susceptible to more than one construction, but instead that the words necessarily require courts to look to sources outside of the text.5
The Sherman Act, for example, raises a serious gap-filling problem. The language of the Act does not answer the question of what practices amount to "conspiracies in restraint of trade." The legislative history is suggestive but unclear,5 and the courts have inevitably taken the Act as a delegation of policymaking power pursuant to quite open-ended criteria.5 Similarly, section is silent on many im-
portant questions, including available defenses, burdens of pleading and persuasion, and exhaustion requirements. Because of the textual silence, judges must fill the gaps. To this extent, the statute delegates power to make common law.
Judicial implementation of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of I96457 can be understood in similar terms, though this example is more controversial. The basic prohibition of "discrimination" provides no guidance on the role of discriminatory effects, the appropriate burdens of proof and production, and the mechanisms for filtering out discriminatory treatment. Judicial answers to these questions sometimes purport to be relatively mechanical responses to congressional commands,5 but in fact they amount to judge-made implementing devices that reflect the judges' own, inevitably value-laden views. In light of the existence of textual gaps on many questions, this approach is hardly an embarrassment or a usurpation, but instead an inevitable part of interpretation. Much of the law of title VII is an unavoidable, and therefore legitimate, norm-ridden exercise in developing gap-filling rules.5 In this respect, the Sherman Act and title VII are closely analogous.
When the language of a statute does not specify its implementing rules, textualism is incomplete: courts must look elsewhere. When Congress has delegated power or left a gap, the line between interpreting and creating federal common law60 becomes quite thin.
(e) Changed Circumstances. The discussion thus far has assumed that circumstances have not changed significantly since the statute was enacted. Textualism becomes even more problematic
when time has affected the assumptions under which the statute was originally written. Changed circumstances may produce ambiguity or interpretive doubt in the text where neither existed before.
Consider the Delaney Clause, which forbids the use as food additives of substances that "induce" cancer. The Delaney Clause was enacted at a time when carcinogenic substances were difficult to detect and all detectable carcinogens were extremely dangerous. These facts, however, no longer hold true, and under current conditions the Delaney Clause almost undoubtedly increases health risks by keeping relatively safe substances off the market and by forcing consumers to resort either to noncarcinogenic substances that pose other risks or to substances that were approved by earlier administrators using the cruder technology of their day. Because the factual premises under which the enacting Congress operated are now demonstrably false, might the word "induce" allow the government to exempt from regulation carcinogens that pose trivial risks? Similarly, would a "public policy" exception to the charitable deduction in the Internal Revenue Code require the government to deny the deduction to schools that engage in racial discrimination, even if those who enacted the Code many decades before believed that such discrimination was perfectly consistent with public policy?63 In short, it is by no means obvious that the statutory text should be understood in accordance with its "original meaning," even if that concept were unproblematic. 1g99
The discussion thus far suggests two principal points. First, and most fundamentally, there is no such thing as an acontextual "text" that can be used as the exclusive guide to interpretation. In easy cases, interpretive norms - on which there is wide or universal consensus - and context both play a part in the process of ascertaining statutory meaning. Because such norms are so widely shared, they are invisible and are not an object of controversy. Only in these cases can meaning ever be said to be "plain." With these qualifications, textualism is generally appropriate. In hard cases, however, courts must resort to a highly visible background norm, or a con-
testable one, or some gap-filling device in order to resolve an interpretive dispute. In these settings, and in this sense, textualism is incomplete.
Second, it is by no means obvious that courts should always rely solely on the text or on the "plain meaning" of its words even in cases in which such reliance leads to determinate results. Although textualism properly draws on the democratic primacy of the legislature, legislative instructions are often unclear and the claim of a command is a myth. An interpretive strategy that relies exclusively on the ordinary meaning of words is precisely that a strategy that reflects a choice among competing possibilities - and it will sometimes produce irrationality or injustice that the legislature did not intend. Textualism of this sort is not incomplete but instead pernicious.
In cases of overinclusiveness, underinclusiveness, changed circumstances, or divergence between ordinary meaning and contextual or legislatively intended meaning, textualism with its disregard of the irrational, unjust, and often unintended outcomes produced by literalism in hard cases - is best defended as a fighting faith, an inference from the system of separation of powers, rather than as a necessary understanding of statutory interpretation. On this view, reliance on ordinary meaning and indifference to context, irrationality, and injustice will discipline the judges, limit their discretion, hold them to Congress' actual words, and warn the lawmakers to be careful about statutory language.67 It is by no means clear, however, that a system of textualism, so defended, will lead to a superior system of law, and there is considerable reason to suspect otherwise. Even the most attractive form of textualism, emphasizing not literalism but the meaning of words read in context and against shared interpretive norms, is inadequate in light of the need to use contestable norms in hard cases and the interpretive difficulties produced by unintended irrationality and injustice.
Contextual Approaches. Sometimes those who rely on the agency theory stress not the statutory text alone, but text as understood in the light of the context and background of the statute. Contextual approaches provide at least partial responses to the problems with textualism, mostly by helping to resolve ambiguities or fill gaps. The traditional efforts to supplement text with context, however, have
textualism, sometimes they operate at the expense of the text, and cess and the constitutional background. The most prominent efforts provision at issue involve structure, purpose, intent, and legislative history.
(a) Structure. - Courts often respond to the various problems in
view, an interpretation should be disfavored if it would make the internal redundancy or confusion. An interpretation that would make
jectionable - on the contrary, they provide significant interpretive tions and at the same time help to make sense of complex regulatory
Structural approaches, however, suffer from two problems. First, consistent and coherent - an assumption that recent theories of legcompromise, and irrationality. If that assumption is false, the court's
as an accurate way of implementing legislative instructions. If the concern with promoting rationality is to be supported, it must be on independent grounds. Second, structural approaches offer only partial help. In many cases, an examination of structure will reveal ambiguities, silences, or delegations. In the hardest cases, the characterization of structure depends largely, not on structure itself, but on a value-laden idea about what conception of the statute works best. To resolve these problems, it will be necessary to look elsewhere.
(b) Purpose, Intent, and History. - In addition to consulting statutory structure, a natural and time-honored response to the problems of textualism has been to look to the purpose, intent, and history of a statute.
(i) Purpose. - Resort to the "purpose" of the statute was especially popular among academic commentators in the and I96O's. Steeped in legal realism, these commentators disparaged approaches for more functional and purposive inquiries. Their resort to purpose was an effort to maintain the role of the courts as agents of the legislature while at the same time acknowledging the inadequacy of textualism. Thus, in the case of the war memorial in the park, the question whether the memorial is a "vehicle" within the meaning of the statute might be answered by asking whether the memorial creates harms (such as noise or pollution) that undermine the purposes for which the statute was enacted. Because the memorial does not, the case is an easy one, and the statutory proscription does not apply.
In some cases, then, reliance on purpose will be a valuable way of providing a context within which to understand statutory terms. Purposive interpretation is, however, far from a complete solution to the problem of statutory construction, for it reproduces all of the problems of textualism in slightly different guise. For example, the purpose may be ambiguous or may reveal a gap or delegation. Are the antitrust laws designed to promote consumer welfare in the economic sense or to protect small business? Is a statute forbidding racial
discrimination designed to proscribe all distinctions on the basis of race, or only those distinctions that burden members of minority groups? Often the legislature itself will not have anticipated such questions. The characterization of legislative purpose is an act of creation rather than discovery.
All of these problems would be formidable even if the legislature consisted of one or a few persons. In the face of multimember institutions, the problem becomes even more troublesome. There will be not one but many purposes in any statute those purposes will sometimes conflict with one another legislators will have complex and conflicting views on purposes the purposes could be described at different levels of generality and purposes will have been compromised and traded off in complex ways. A statute designed to protect workers might also be intended to help union at the expense of nonunion employment a statute designed to protect the environment might also be intended to protect eastern coal producers.
Purposive interpretation may also suffer from overinclusiveness or underinclusiveness. By taking the purpose of a statute out of context, one might broadly read a provision to prevent behavior that under the most plausible reading the statute should not reach. Similarly, an unduly narrow categorization might prevent a statute from reaching a situation that should fall within its scope. Advocates of purposive interpretation sometimes disregard the fact that purposes are expressed through and have no life independent of statutory words. The words represent the law.
When circumstances change, reliance on the statutory purpose becomes even trickier. Assume, for example, that Congress enacts a statute imposing significant procedural requirements on regulatory agencies engaging in adjudicative tasks but lenient requirements on agencies engaging in rulemaking, and that Congress thought almost all important administrative business would be done through adjudication. But thirty years after enactment, those assumptions no longer
427
hold, as agencies engage in extensive rulemaking and do most of their significant work in that way. Is it so clear that judicial "bending" of ambiguous provisions in the statute to impose greater procedural requirements in rulemaking is unfaithful to the purpose of the law? Indeed, is it so clear that such an interpretation is bending at all? In view of the changed context, what would it mean for courts to be "faithful" to the original purpose?80
The problem in these settings is that mechanical transplantation of statutory purposes to new settings is unlikely to produce sensible results even from the standpoint of the enacting legislature. Nor is it sufficient to say that the legislature rather than the courts should respond to changed circumstances. Often it is unrealistic to expect a legislative response. ' More important, the issue for interpretation is the meaning of the statute in the new circumstances. Meaning does not remain static across changes in law, policy, and fact. Interpretation that brings the legislature into the present will, however, inevitably involve a large measure of discretion and a corresponding danger of judicial abuse.
Purposive interpretation, then, is far from a panacea. Although it is frequently helpful in giving context to statutory terms, the effort to characterize legislative purpose often produces serious problems, whether or not circumstances have changed. In some cases, the purpose might be characterized in many ways, all of which are faithful to the original enactment. The act of characterization is therefore one of invention rather than discovery.
(ii) Legislative Intent and Legislative History. It is often suggested that in hard cases, the meaning of the statute should be derived by ascertaining the intent of those who enacted it.8 This approach
presented. For those who emphasize legislative intent, the legislative In recent years, the Supreme Court has been divided about the suggested that the question for interpretation is in fact one of "congresintent,"8 to the identification of "intent." Justice Scalia, however, has expressed history in particular.8 In Justice Scalia's view, the role of the courts Moreover, Justice Scalia suggests that legislative history is frequently the floor debates, reflects little, if any, general congressional will.8 Judicial reliance on legislative history thus increases the power of
itself. Above all, Justice Scalia argues, the legislative history was never enacted and is therefore not law.8
Concerns of this sort are both legitimate and well-taken. Although it is proper to look at a statute's background in the form of actually enacted and repealed provisions, the legislative history, which was never enacted, should rarely be permitted to supplant the statutory words as they are ordinarily understood.8 This is so because attention to the language promotes the rule of law and because of democratic and constitutional considerations - the words rather than the intent survived the procedures of article I. Moreover, such an approach might both discipline Congress, by forcing it to attend to its words, and minimize judicial discretion by barring judges from relying on policies and principles of their own. But Justice Scalia somewhat overstates the point.8 The legislative history will sometimes reveal what some or many members of the Congress thought about the meaning of an ambiguous term, and that understanding is relevant. It is unlikely that the history will only reflect the views of selfinterested private groups. Moreover, legislative history provides a sense of the context and purpose of a statutory enactment, which, as we have seen, can provide important interpretive help.
Finally, and most fundamentally, it is not clear where judges are to look if they refuse to consider the legislative history. Without reference to the history, interpretation sometimes becomes far less bounded, and it is no surprise that those who reject intent and history tend to be textualists - a strategy that in hard cases will
in rare cases of unintended irrationality or injustice, courts should also not ignore it, especially when the text is unclear. reliance on legislative intent, whether or not derived on the basis of that Congress enacts statutes rather than its own views about what unless they are in the statute. The words, not the "intent," represent
cases.96 If the legislators understood a statutory word as a term of
art, that understanding should prevail courts should attend to the intended meaning rather than the usual meaning of the words if the former is clear and the latter would produce absurdity. Moreover, an undisputed congressional intent should ordinarily be followed in the event of linguistic ambiguity. But the subjective intentions, even if ascertainable, are not controlling unless enacted.
The second set of problems is that legislative intent, like legislative purpose, is largely a fiction in hard cases - a problem aggravated by the extraordinary difficulties of aggregating the "intentions" of a multimember body. With or without these problems, there are risks of ambiguity, overinclusiveness, and underinclusiveness in relying on legislative intent, just as there are in relying on text and purpose.
The third problem is that Congress may have enacted a concept capable of change over time. Those who emphasize legislative intent sometimes say that interpreters should attempt to "go back" to the beliefs and hopes of the enacting legislature to see how it would decide the question had it been presented. It is unclear that this "imaginative reconstruction" approach is either consistent with Congress' interpretive instructions or a sensible way of ascertaining the meaning of statutory terms. In the face of changed circumstances, perhaps the better route would be to imagine that the enacting legislature could be "brought forward" into the present and then to ask how it would decide the question in light of new developments of law, fact, and
When circumstances have changed, backward-looking interpretation may produce absurd results, and often it is fully plausible to think that members of the enacting legislature intended the meaning of the statute not to be controlled by its original understanding. In such cases - signaled most obviously by open-ended terms capable of change over time - it should be relatively uncontroversial for courts to depart from original meaning here meaning obviously shifts with circumstances. More generally, the legislature will often have had no considered view on the question of backward-looking or forward-looking interpretation. In these circumstances, reliance on intent will lead to intractable problems. Something other than intent must be the basis for decision. '
For all of these reasons, the notion of legislative intent is at best an incomplete guide to statutory construction. If the legislative intent is ascertainable, it should be used to resolve otherwise doubtful questions about statutory meaning. Nevertheless, difficult questions will often remain.
In sum, the traditional contextual approaches can help remedy some of the problems with reliance on text "alone." But sometimes structure, purpose, intent, and history will leave gaps or ambiguities, and reliance on purpose, intent, and history may lead to interpretive mistakes. Although it would be foolish to dispense with these tools, they cannot generate a workable approach to interpretation without considerable supplementation.
3. Legal Process. Some of those who stress the importance of background and context acknowledge that in some cases, a reliance on these sources will be inadequate. Thus the celebrated treatment by Hart and Sacks in The Legal Process0 suggests that to solve hard cases, the court "should assume, unless the contrary unmistakably appears, that the legislature was made up of reasonable persons pursuing reasonable purposes reasonably."'10 In a similar vein, Karl Llewellyn counseled courts to "strive to make sense as a whole out of our law as a whole.'
Legal process approaches stand poised somewhere between agency theories of the judicial role and understandings of an altogether dif-
led many to return to the text - an understandable but unsuccessful strategy. The same problems underlie Ronald Dworkin's influential treatment of this subject.' Dworkin argues that courts should interpret statutes in accordance with the best principle that can be brought forward in support of what the legislature "has done." In Dworkin's view, the judge should see himself as "a partner continuing to develop, in what he believes is the best way, the statutory scheme Congress began. The judge should ask "what coherent system of political convictions would best justify what [the legislature] has done," and should find and apply to disputed issues of interpretation "the best justification . . . of a past legislative
This position is a clear heir to the legal process position above all, in its emphasis on the use of judicial interpretation to produce reasonable results, to guard against arbitrariness, and to produce coherence in the legal system. As did its legal process predecessors, Dworkin's approach sees the courts partly as agents (hence the emphasis on "what the legislature has done") and partly as creative actors relying on normative theories of their own. In a number of respects, Dworkin's approach fits congenially with what I suggest here: it, too, insists on judicial efforts to promote a principled rather than ad hoc set of legal requirements and to foster what Dworkin calls "integrity," sometimes in the face of legislative "intent" or the actual character of the legislative process.
Dworkin's approach is marred, however, by the open-ended character of its guiding interpretive principle - a failing that provides the final link between Dworkin's effort and that of the legal process school. The dangers of judicial discretion in searching for and giving content to "the best principle" are largely unaddressed. Dworkin fails to explore the institutional background, or the substantive functions and failures of statutory regimes. The characteristics of the modern regulatory state are entirely invisible in Dworkin's treatment. Dworkin's account draws far too sharp a dichotomy between "the best principle" - found through tools external (to what extent?) to the disputed provision or the prevailing legal culture - and "what the legislature has done," with the latter sometimes treated as if it were a kind of brute fact.
effort to find the principle that best justifies what the legislature has done is largely untethered. An emphasis on text, history, or intention seems a most appealing refuge from a general inquiry of that sort. In particular, reliance on the text seems to have a far better democratic pedigree and to hold far more promise for limiting judicial discretion.
4. The Proper Role of Traditional Sources of Meaning and the Failure of the Agency View. The discussion thus far suggests several conclusions about the use of traditional tools of statutory construction. The text, understood in its context and in concert with shared background norms, is usually sufficient to resolve interpretive disputes. Sometimes, however, the text is ambiguous or reveals a delegation or gap. Moreover, the ordinary meaning of the text should not be decisive when the statutory structure or purpose (if subject to an uncontroversial characterization) suggests an alternative meaning, and when a literal interpretation would produce a patently unjust or irrational application that was not clearly sought by the legislature. Similarly, the legislative "intent" - as reflected in the legislative history - is admissible to resolve ambiguities, but it usually should not be permitted to overcome the ordinary meaning of the statutory words if that meaning is otherwise clear. The only exception is when the history supports the conclusion that literalism would produce unintended irrationality or injustice." In some cases, however, all of these sources of statutory meaning will leave serious gaps or uncertainties, and sometimes interpretive principles are properly invoked to press language in particular directions.
As complete theories of statutory construction, then, the most prominent examples of the agency view of the judicial role appear to fail it is time to consider the implications of that failure." The agency view starts from the important truth that it would be improper for judges to construe statutes to mean whatever the judges think best the lawmaking primacy of the legislature, with its superior democratic pedigree, prohibits such a conception of statutory "interpretation." It follows from this understanding that where there is neither interpretive doubt nor constitutional objection, the judgment of the electorally accountable branch should prevail.
The agency theory requires that judges exercise minimal discretion and avoid inquiries into the constitutional backdrop, appropriate institutional arrangements, statutory function, or larger social goals. Instead, the judge must be largely a functionary performing a mechanical process. This is, at bottom, a formalist position formalist because it sees the process as entirely autonomous and free from valueladen inquiries. Formalism and the agency view are entirely unobjectionable insofar as they recognize an important distinction - itself value-laden to be sure - between the relatively constrained operation of adjudicating statutory questions ("interpretation") and the relatively open-ended process of legislating. But like all formalist positions, the agency view of statutory interpretation is subject to two sorts of objections. First, the agency conception of "meaning" is too crude. As we have seen, language is not self-interpreting, and sometimes legislators delegate, self-consciously or otherwise, gap-filling power to the courts. Moreover, the instructions of the principal are unintelligible without background norms that interpreters alone can supply. Usually such norms are uncontested within the legal culture, and therefore it is sufficient to rely on the generally accepted meanings of words. In such cases, the incompleteness of formalism is not troublesome for interpretive practice, and the uncontested meanings should ordinarily be given their full scope. In other cases, courts must resort to contestable or conspicuous interpretive principles, or gap-filling devices, in order to decide the question of meaning. It is important to emphasize that this is a conceptual or logical claim, not a proposition about the appropriate distribution of powers among administrative agencies, courts, and legislatures. It depends not at all on a belief in the wisdom and decency of the judges. To recognize the need for interpretive norms when Congress has not enacted them is not to confer on courts power that they do not already, and necessarily, have.
Second, the broad legitimacy claims of the agency theory rely on question-begging and probably indefensible premises. For such claims to be persuasive, those who invoke the agency theory must claim that a formalist approach to construction - again, to the (limited) extent that it is possible - is constitutionally compelled, or (what may amount to much the same thing) will lead on balance to the best or most sensible system of law. This latter claim must be under-
stood as a belief that the ordinary or original meaning of statutory words must control, even if it would lead to absurd or unjust results. But it is far more likely that the occasional introduction of other considerations will lead to a superior system.
For example, assume that statutory language, while ambiguous, is most naturally read to lead in a direction that is, by consensus, irrational that a statute might be understood as giving open-ended authority to a bureaucracy that the most obvious reading of a statute provides bizarre or unjust results in light of changes in the fifty years since its enactment. We will encounter many such cases below. In all of these settings, courts that act as more than mere agents and that invoke contestable background norms will produce a more sensible system of law. Indeed, sometimes such a role will be consistent with the best reading of Congress' interpretive instructions, or will be the best understanding to attribute to Congress when it has made no considered judgment on the point. For this reason, courts should be authorized to depart from the ordinary or original meaning and to press ambiguous words in particular directions if the context suggests that this would lead to superior outcomes.120
Of course, there are risks in admitting power of this sort, largely in the form of increased judicial discretion. For this reason, invocation of controversial background norms should be modest. Although no decisive argument is available to demonstrate why and to what extent the recognition of such authority will make matters better rather than worse, it is possible to point to institutional characteristics of the judiciary that occasionally justify what might seem an aggressive role in interpretation.
First, the focus on the particular circumstances enables judges to deal with applications that no legislature, no matter how farsighted, could conceivably have foreseen. Under changed or unforeseen circumstances, mechanical application of statutory terms is unlikely to produce sound results, even from the standpoint of the enacting legislature. By contrast, judicial resolution of individual cases, allowing an emphasis on particular settings with which a lawmaker could not be familiar, contains significant advantages for interpretation.
Second, because of their independence and their deliberative capacities, courts have significant advantages over a legislature that may be influenced by parochial interests and is frequently responsive to momentary demands.122 Considerations of this sort were emphasized in The Federalist, quite outside of the context of constitutional review. Those considerations support a relatively aggressive role for the courts in statutory interpretation, one that sees judges as something other than agents. That position is consistent as well with historical practice.
It would of course be possible to use contestable principles modestly or quite aggressively, and courts have occasionally used interpretive norms to construe statutes in ways that are plainly inconsistent with the outcome that would be reached through reliance on text, structure, purpose, and ordinary understandings of linguistic commands. As a general rule, however, courts should use controversial background norms sparingly, in deference to the basic principle of democratic primacy. But in some situations - for example, when conventional interpretation would produce absurdity or gross injustice, when changed circumstances call for creativity, when constitutional considerations counsel courts to interpret statutes in one direction
courts should be more aggressive in statutory interpretation. In the abstract, these observations make it difficult to decide to what extent departures from the agency model are appropriate. The discussion in Part IV is designed to provide a more concrete understanding of the problem.
B. Indeterminacy? Conventionalism?
The problems with textualism and with the agency view lead some to conclude that statutory interpretation produces unpredictability and indeterminacy in most or all cases. Noting that interpretation is possible only within the context of interpretive conventions, others argue that it is not possible to change, debate, or even theorize about interpretation. One just does it.
Those who accept conventionalism differ from those who believe that statutory meaning produces indeterminacy. For conventionalists, meaning is hardly open-ended. But the two camps have much in common. Both reject the possibility of criteria with which to distinguish between good and bad interpretations, or to mediate disputes over meaning. In both accounts, words have the meanings that they do simply because people in positions of authority so interpret them. On this point, both accounts are inadequate.
i. Indeterminacy. It is not always clear whether the claims of indeterminacy are meant to be normative or positive. According to the normative version, there are no correct answers to questions of statutory interpretation, but instead merely subjective (and perhaps arbitrary) opinions. In contrast, the positive version has it that judicial decisions cannot be predicted in advance, even if there are criteria by which reasonable people might mediate among interpretive disputes.
Whether normative or positive, the claim that statutory meaning is "indeterminate" is wildly overstated. Claims about the inevitable indeterminacy of interpretation usually suffer from a failure to take account of the contextual character of linguistic commands. Communication is possible only because of agreement over the governing
rules these rules enable people to understand each other, and they sharply limit the number of possible interpretations. When taken in their setting - in their context and culture - statutes are usually susceptible to only one plausible meaning. Judicial interpretation of statutes is therefore quite predictable, largely because background norms are uncontested among the judges. Even where background norms are in conflict, it is often possible to know how the case will come out, or at least to limit the number of possible outcomes, because one can predict which norms will govern in the circumstances. For this reason, the claim of indeterminacy, if taken as a positive one, is implausible.
It is possible to show as well that some interpretations are correct. This is most obviously true in easy cases, in which there is no controversy over the meaning of text in light of background norms but it is true in hard cases as well - a point to which I return below. To make the unsurprising point that the choice among interpretive strategies or background norms implicates a value judgment is hardly to say that the choice is arbitrary. The existence of judgments of value leads to a conclusion of arbitrariness only for the most incorrigible of positivists. Moreover, the fact that someone might argue that a statute does not mean what it appears to say, or might characterize the legislative purpose in a counterintuitive way, does not mean that such arguments are convincing or even plausible. Nor does the existence of some hard cases mean that all cases are hard. The ultimate task is to develop criteria by which to mediate among conflicting value judgments in concrete cases, including hard ones - a task taken up in Part IV.
Conventionalism. These points help to identify the flaws in conventionalist accounts of legal interpretation. It is correct and salutary to emphasize, as conventionalists do, that interpretive assumptions are always in force, and that texts do not have "inherent" or "necessary" meanings in the strong sense that those meanings remain constant across different contexts and cultures. Moreover, some words simply mean what they mean they are not a subject of reflection and criticism to someone who speaks the language. But these claims - attacks on implausible versions of textualism or formalism provide little help in the descriptive or normative tasks of interpre-
tation. They do not explain how conflicts within a group of interpreters should be, or in fact are, resolved. Above all, they do not suggest that participants in the legal culture should rest content with existing interpretive strategies, or that it is impossible to evaluate those strategies or proposed alternatives. Interpreters in fact choose among strategies on the basis of the reasons offered on their behalf. To claim that meaning is only a function of culture is to give up on the important questions altogether.
Moreover, the conventionalist suggestion that interpretive norms themselves need interpretation hardly suggests that there are no criteria for assessing particular norms, or that people are unable to explain why some such norms would make things worse rather than better. 133 In short, the conventionalist account is both too crude and too flat. It treats interpreters as always the objects or recipients, and never the subjects or creators, of interpretive practice. It fails to account for the related phenomena of choice among interpretive strategies and of change over time.
C. Extratextual Norms
In recent years, courts and commentators have proposed three theories of statutory construction that rely on extratextual norms. The first involves a background rule in favor of private ordering the second calls for a rule of deference to regulatory agencies the third refers to the difficulties in aggregating diverse legislative views and the notion that statutes represent "deals" among self-interested actors. Each of these approaches suffers from significant flaws.
Private Ordering. - On one view, the constitutional system leaves citizens free to conduct their affairs without governmental interference, and that basic principle requires courts to interpret statutes to extend only as far as their explicit language and history require. 13 For example, courts should not recognize implied causes of action, since statutes ought not be taken to intrude on private autonomy except to the extent that they do so unambiguously. 13 An interpretive principle of this sort would have enormous consequences for statutory interpretation it would limit statutes in all areas of social and economic regulation, from discrimination law to pollution control to securities fraud. In short, the private ordering norm requires that statutes with gaps or ambiguities be interpreted unfavorably towards their intended beneficiaries.
The presumption in favor of private ordering is merely the most recent incarnation of the view, set out in the early twentieth century and before, that statutes in derogation of the common law should be read against a laissez-faire baseline and narrowly construed. In some legal systems, and in some contexts, such a presumption would be desirable and the presumption is always sound insofar as it recognizes that where Congress has neither legislated nor left a gap for interpreters to fill, no law constrains private behavior. In the wake of the New Deal, however, a broad interpretive norm in favor of private ordering can no longer be sustained. This is so partly because the post-New Deal system is generally superior to its common law predecessor insofar as it recognizes that private autonomy is a product of legal controls and that modern regulation often promotes both economic welfare and distributive justice. The more fundamental problem with the broad presumption in favor of private autonomy is its inconsistency with the values that underlie modern government. Such a presumption would invoke understandings repudiated by the democratic branches of government in order, ironically, to discern the reach of statutes enacted and administered by those very branches. It would be highly undemocratic, and indeed presumptuous, for courts to invoke laissez-faire principles in support of such a judicial role. Gaps should not be filled in, and ambiguities should not be resolved, by reference to norms that run counter to those of the enacting Congress in particular and the modern regulatory state in general.
Deference to Agency Interpretations of Law. Another view, finding considerable support in recent cases, maintains that courts should defer to agency interpretations of law whenever the statute is ambiguous. Because of their superior accountability, expertise, and ability to coordinate complex enactments, agencies should be given the benefit of every doubt. Unlike the private ordering principle, this view has roots in the New Deal period, with that era's endorsement of administrative autonomy and it places a strong emphasis on the
displacement of judicial lawmaking represented by the creation of regulatory schemes. Thus, in the exceptionally important Chevron case, the Supreme Court said that courts should defer to agency interpretations of law unless "Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.
Even if read for all that it is worth, the Chevron position would not resolve every disputed statutory question. Threshold interpretive questions must be asked and answered even under Chevron. For example, courts have to rely on some methodology that is independent of the rule of deference to decide when statutes are ambiguous. The rule of deference would, however, have significant consequences, because it would remit all uncertain cases to regulatory agencies for administrative resolution. Moreover, such a rule is quite appealing, especially when Congress has delegated law-interpreting power to the agency or when the question involves the agency's specialized factfinding and policymaking competence, as do "mixed" issues of law and fact.
For several reasons, however, a general rule of judicial deference to all agency interpretations of law would be unsound. The case for deference depends in the first instance on congressional instructions. If Congress has told courts to defer to agency interpretations, courts must do so. But many regulatory statutes were born out of legislative distrust for agency discretion they represent an effort to limit administrative authority through clear legislative specifications. A rule of deference in the face of ambiguity would be inconsistent with understandings, endorsed by Congress, of the considerable risks posed by administrative discretion.14 An ambiguity is simply not a delegation of law-interpreting power. Chevron confuses the two.
Second, the notion that administrators may interpret statutes that they administer is inconsistent with separation of powers principles that date back to the early days of the American republic and that retain considerable vitality today. The basic case for judicial review depends on the proposition that foxes should not guard henhouses. It would be most peculiar, for example, to argue that courts should defer to congressional or state interpretations of constitutional provisions whenever there is ambiguity in the constitutional text. Those who are limited by a legal restriction should not be permitted to determine the nature of the limitation, or to decide its scope. The relationship of the Constitution to Congress parallels the relationship of governing statutes to agencies. In both contexts, an independent arbiter should determine the nature of the limitation.
This basic principle assumes special importance in light of the awkward constitutional position of the administrative agency. Broad delegations of power to regulatory agencies have been allowed largely on the assumption that courts would be available to ensure agency fidelity to whatever statutory directives have been issued. If agencies are able to decide on the meaning of ambiguities in these directives, the nondelegation problem grows dramatically. A firm judicial hand in the interpretation of statutes is thus desirable.
The point can be made more vivid by imagining cases involving such questions as whether agency action is reviewable whether agencies may issue fines whether agency jurisdiction extends to new or unforeseen areas. In all of these cases, it would be peculiar to say that the agency is permitted to decide the meaning of a law whose scope is so directly relevant to agency self-interest. In short, a general rule of deference to agency interpretations of law would be inconsistent with the best reading of Congress' interpretive instructions, with the constitutional backdrop, and with the goal of promoting sound regulatory policy.
3. Public Choice Theory and "Deals." A number of commentators have recently attempted to find guidance for statutory interpretation in welfare economics and public choice theory. Two claims are crucial here - the first descriptive, the second normative. The first claim is that the concept of legislative purpose is incoherent. Seeing
private groups, these commentators maintain that the legislative prodifficulties in aggregating the preferences and beliefs of numerous "deals" and not intelligible collective "purposes." Some of those who framers of the Constitution. should not rely on unitary or public-regarding purposes, but instead relevant "deal." Courts should not see legislators as "reasonable people of multiple pressures imposed on multiple actors. The contrast with
Consider, for example, how an advocate of the deals approach lution implicitly authorizes victims of pollution to bring suits against victims have not obtained that right as part of the statutory "deal," and the right should be denied. By contrast, a court that saw the legislature as "reasonable people acting reasonably," or that treated
legislation as public-spirited, might well recognize private suits as a way of enforcing the statutory mandate.
Advocates of the "deals" approach correctly emphasize legislative compromise, and they have also performed a valuable role in suggesting that legislative purposes are often multiple and even conflicting. As a theory of statutory interpretation, however, the "deals" approach suffers from many of the failings of textualism. The first problem is indeterminacy. In many cases, the terms of any deal will be hopelessly unclear in the absence of background norms that a system of interpretation one that has nothing to do with deals alone can supply. For example, an approach that sees statutes as deals is in fact unhelpful in cases involving implied causes of action. If a statute is treated as a deal between industries seeking protection against too much regulation on the one hand, and environmental groups attempting to prevent pollution on the other, what result is appropriate? The answer would be obvious if there were a background norm to the effect that regulatory statutes generally create private rights of action. In that case, the failure of industry to obtain a prohibition on such rights would suggest that the deal authorized them. The result would also be clear if the background norm forbade private rights without explicit legislative authorization: the deal did not include them. The central question is what the relevant norm should be. The claim that statutes should be understood as deals provides no help in deciding on the background against which deals must be read. In the end, advocates of the "deals" approach - like most formalists rely in fact on a substantive background norm ' it is that norm, on which the "deals" approach is utterly unhelpful and indeed silent, that is the true basis for decision.
Even if the problem of indeterminacy could be overcome, the question would remain whether courts should treat statutes as unprincipled deals. The argument in favor of that system would have to claim that it is constitutionally required, or that the legal system that would emerge would be preferable to the alternatives. Some have stressed the dangers of judicial discretion, the fact that statutes are in fact deals, the likelihood that a system of deals will be responsive to constituents' demands for law, and the value of obtaining deals in the first place.
Often, however, efforts to understand statutes as deals depend on highly artificial premises. The empirical work points in both directions. There is evidence that public officials often respond to their own conception of the public interest.' Numerous people, moreover, help to produce statutes, and it is not easy to see how the multiple forces can meaningfully be thought to produce a deal. The problems of aggregating multiple desires do not always prevent the ascription of "purpose" to legislation. The claim of realism is therefore overstated.
Even if statutes were deals, the argument that courts should always treat them as such is hardly self-evident. Indeed, the "deals" approach tends to break down if conceptions of politics rooted in interest-group pluralism cannot be defended on normative grounds. Far from having a good constitutional pedigree, the pluralist understanding runs afoul of the fundamental constitutional norm against naked interest-group transfers. That norm proscribes legislative efforts to transfer resources from one group to another simply because of the political power of the latter. The norm has firm roots in both Madisonian republicanism - designed to ensure a measure of deliberation in government - and in current law under a number of constitutional provisions, including the equal protection, due process, eminent domain, and contract clauses.' An effort to treat statutes as mere deals is thus inconsistent with the basic constitutional background. Moreover, interest-group pluralism cannot be defended as a method for ensuring accurate aggregation of citizen preferences. Public choice theory itself reveals that pluralist systems reflect collective
The realists argued that the canons substituted unhelpful, misleading, and mechanical rules for a more pragmatic and functional inquiry into statutory purposes and structure. 'This view has deeply penetrated modern legal culture. Almost no one has had a favorable word to say about the canons in many years. For the most part, the canons are treated as anachronisms.
Llewellyn's demonstration was persuasive insofar as it characterized the use of canons as a crude version of formalism. In fact, however, his claim of indeterminacy and mutual contradiction was greatly overstated some of the canons actually influenced judicial behavior insofar as they reflected background norms that helped to give meaning to statutory words or to resolve hard cases. The notion that courts should narrowly construe statutes in derogation of the common law is the most prominent example. As we have seen, Llewellyn's abandonment of the canons left him with the hopelessly banal claim that decisions depended on "the sense of the situation as seen by the court"165 and that "a court must strive to make sense as a whole out of our law as a whole.' Llewellyn did not unpack the notion of "sense" and its possible relationship to canons of construction. Indeed, he did not recognize that quite particular - and defensible - conceptions of "sense," often forming the judge's initial, intuitive, or even considered response to a statutory dispute, might themselves be reflected in canons of construction. Llewellyn, like many of the realists, attempted to liberate legal thought from flawed structures by denying the need for structures altogether, but structures are inevitably present.
The canons of construction continue to be a prominent feature in the federal and state courts. The use of general guides to construction
in the form of "clear-statement" principles and background understandings - can be found in every area of modern law.
An analogy may be helpful here. The law of contracts is pervaded by - indeed, it consists largely of - a set of principles filling contractual gaps when the parties have been silent, or when the meaning of their words is unclear. Imagine, for example, that the parties have been silent on the time of performance, damages in the event of breach, or the consequences of dramatically changed circumstances and partial default. The use of implied terms, or "off-the-rack" provisions, is a familiar part of the law of contract and it would be most peculiar to say that they are an illegitimate incursion into the usual process of "interpreting" the parties' intent. Without implied terms of some sort, contracts simply would not be susceptible to construction. Implied terms also provide the background against which people enter into agreements.
To a large degree, interpretive principles - including the traditional "canons" - serve the same function in public law. They too help judges to construe both statements and silences they too should not be seen as the intrusion of controversial judgments into "ordinary" interpretation. There are, however, differences as well as similarities. In the law of contracts, it is often said that implied terms should attempt to "mimic the market" by doing what the parties would do if they had made provision on the subject. In this respect, contract law is pervaded by a background norm in favor of party autonomy and the market. In statutory construction, by contrast, the notion of "mimicking the market" is unavailable, and the idea that one should do what Congress would have done is far from a complete guide. As we have seen, how Congress would have resolved the question is sometimes unclear sometimes the resolution of the enacting Congress would produce difficulties as a result of changed circumstances sometimes courts properly call into play principles - many of them
constitutionally inspired - that push statutes in directions that diverge from the conclusion that Congress would have reached if it had resolved the matter. Despite these differences, the critical point is that, as in contract law, the interpretation of a text requires courts to refer to background norms in interpreting terms.
B. The Functions of Interpretive Principles:
A Catalogue
Part of the problem in coming to terms with the canons is that they have served different functions, as do the interpretive principles courts generally employ. Some of these functions are nearly invisible: the norms are so widely shared, and so central to the very process of communicating in English, that they seem to be part of the words rather than part of the interpreter's tools. Some such "norms" are simply part of meaning and not open to discussion others are also invisible but value-laden and potentially subject to evaluation. Still other norms look to values that more visibly serve substantive or institutional goals and are applicable principally in the context of interpreting statutes: these norms - here referred to as background norms - often seem extratextual. It is useful to distinguish between the invisible norms and background norms because usually only the latter are controversial and constitute the subject of interpretive disputes. The distinction, however, is imprecise, for interpretive norms often serve multiple functions simultaneously, and substantive and institutional functions are served by invisible norms as well.
x. Orientation to Meaning. - Interpretive principles may be designed to orient judicial readers to the text in order to help them to ascertain its meaning in the particular case. This is the most uncontroversial function of interpretive principles. Most of these "principles" are so internalized that they are invisible and serve as an ordinary part of communication itself. They operate as rules of syntax or grammar. Some of these syntactic norms have been explicitly identified as guides to interpretation. Consider, for example, the idea that the language of a particular provision will be taken in the context of the statute as a whole and will not be interpreted so as to do violence to the statutory structure. As we have seen with structural approaches to interpretation, this idea is helpful in ascertaining the meaning of a term that, if understood in a different context, would be ambiguous or indeed would have a "literal" meaning contrary to that indicated by the particular setting. Even apparently unambiguous statutory terms might have a counterintuitive meaning if other provisions of
the statute so indicate. 173 The same considerations support the principle that statutory provisions should be read so as not to create internal inconsistency or conflict with other enactments, and the idea that, where there is a potential conflict, specific provisions should prevail over general terms in the same statute.
Many of the infamous Latin-phrased canons serve similarly mundane functions. For example, the principle of ejusdem generis where general words follow a specific enumeration, the general words should be limited to persons or things similar to those enumerated - derives from an understanding that the general words are probably not meant to include matters entirely far afield from the specific enumeration. If understood to be truly general, the general words would make the specific enumeration redundant.
A more controversial example is the principle expressio unius est exclusio alterius: to include one thing is to exclude another. Courts sometimes use this principle when Congress has specified a list of actors entitled to something - say, the people authorized to obtain review of federal administrative action, or to obtain welfare benefits - in order to support the conclusion that those not specified are not entitled to the good in question. The assumption is that by expressly singling out those people to whom it wanted to grant the good, Congress implicitly decided to deny all others the good. The expressio unius canon should not be used mechanically. The failure to refer explicitly to the group in question may reflect inadvertence, inability to reach consensus, or a decision to delegate the decision to the courts, rather than an implicit negative legislative decision on the subject. Moreover, Congress could have explicitly solved the problem by specifying that the group in question may not receive the benefit, and the availability of that option weakens the inference that silence resolves
the issue against the group. Sometimes, however, the principle is a helpful way of discovering statutory meaning in a particular case. When it is plausible to assume that Congress has considered all the alternatives, the legislative failure to grant authority to one person suggests that it intended to deny the relevant authority to that person.
Although particular interpretive principles of this type will be controversial, many of them serve the time-honored function of helping to discern the meaning of the statute in the particular case.
2. Interpretive Instructions. - Interpretive principles may also serve as guides to what might be called the interpretive instructions of the legislature. The goal is to capture an actual or hypothetical legislative judgment about how statutes should be construed. The easiest cases involve explicit legislative instructions about interpretation. The first sections of the United States Code thus set out such instructions, as do the codes of other countries. Such statutes may attempt to provide substantive guidance. 182
Some interpretive principles, however, are a product of an understanding of implicit rather than explicit legislative interpretive instructions. For example, a familiar and often quite important principle is that appropriations measures should not lightly be taken to amend substantive statutes. That principle does not of course indicate Congress' specific instructions on every bill. Appropriations measures are often designed to amend substantive statutes. As a general matter, would want courts to interpret appropriations measures: the rules of

Another substantive principle, one without constitutional foundations but easily defended, holds that statutes and treaties should, in the face of ambiguity, be construed favorably to Indian tribes. There is no reason to think that this notion will tend accurately to describe congressional intent in particular cases. It is instead a judgemade rule responding to obvious disparities in bargaining power and to inequitable treatment of Native Americans by the nation in the past. Other substantive norms counsel courts not to infer private causes of action from regulatory statutes, to assume that legislation of Congress applies only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, not to imply exemptions from taxation, to assume that criminal statutes require mens rea, to avoid irrationality, to counteract obsolescence, and to protect common law rights in the absence of a clear statement from Congress.
C. An Alternative Method:
The Agency Theory of the Judicial Role Reconsidered
The functions played by background norms suggest an alternative to the conventional understandings of statutory interpretation, an alternative that explains both the substantial areas of agreement and the nature of interpretive disputes. On this account, the statutory text is the starting point, but it becomes intelligible only because interpretive norms give it content. In most cases, the text, together with widely shared background norms, will be unambiguous. In other cases, the text alone will produce doubt, but a careful consideration of the context, structure, purpose, and legislative history of a statute will lead to a single conclusion. In the remaining cases, the history will itself be ambiguous or will reflect the work of an unrepresentative, self-interested group the "purpose" of a multimember body will be impossible to characterize and other contextual considerations will be unhelpful. In these hard cases, faced with the familiar problems of ambiguity, overinclusiveness, underinclusiveness, and gaps, courts must resort to more conspicuous background norms.
Many of these cases will involve norms that are visible but not controversial others will involve the application of norms that are both. Such norms serve the full range of interpretive functions. In the most controversial cases, they are intended to improve lawmaking or to further substantive policies. Sometimes the goals motivating these norms are disputable - consider the protection of federalism, the rule of lenity, the protection of Native Americans - and sometimes it is unclear how well the particular principle serves those goals. In hard cases, however, the dispute is over the background principles, not the dictionary meaning of the words. Although it is tempting to see the use of such principles as a controversial intrusion of "value judgments" or "policy concerns" into the process of legal interpretation, this view misconceives the nature of statutory construction. As we have seen, norms of this sort are an indispensable part of the process of deriving meaning from text.
The challenge is, first, to identify norms on which participants in the legal culture do or might agree and, second, to generate principles under which conflicting norms can be reconciled. Inevitably that task will be highly value-laden. It is impossible to select interpretive norms without assessing their role in improving or impairing the operation of statutory law.2 The choice of norms will call for judgments of value and policy precisely to the considerable extent that formalist approaches to statutory construction are incomplete or unacceptable. It follows that the interpretive norms will be defensible only to the extent that good substantive and institutional arguments can be advanced on their behalf.
Undertaken properly, however, the task-of developing interpretive norms will not amount to an unanchored or entirely open-ended inquiry into the best outcomes in particular cases. Even when the traditional sources of interpretation leave gaps, courts should not resolve cases merely by deciding what result would in their view be best, all things considered. Instead, the legal culture should be taken to impose a degree of constraint on the selection of the governing principles. For example, we have seen that a broad private autonomy norm is unacceptable largely because of its inconsistency with the fabric of the modern regulatory state the same would be true for a norm in favor of, say, communism or fascism. Moreover, some interpretive principles - for example, the idea that statutes should be interpreted favorably to the Indian tribes or so as not to override state law - are so well-established that they have the status of precedent. Of course, the decision to follow such constraints must itself be justified on normative grounds. But there are good institutional reasons
to require courts to use principles that are consistent both with the least if the existing norms are not anachronistic and if the state and

Those norms seem to have taken on a life of their own indeed they appear invisible to those who rely on them. Sometimes, however, these norms conflict with the values that underlie the modern regulatory state, or they otherwise impair governmental performance. A task for the future is to design background norms that are well-adapted to contemporary conceptions of the relationship between the citizen and the state and that are rooted in a solid understanding of the purposes and pathologies of regulation.
Outside of law, and to some extent within the legal academy, it has become fashionable to suggest that interpretive disputes are resolved on the basis of agreements within a community of interpretIt should be clear by now that the central tasks here description and prescription - require far more, especially in light of the fact that the community will frequently be divided. In these circumstances, the task is to locate the sources of interpretive principles and to identify those that deserve general respect.
In this Part, I attempt to carry out that task by outlining a series of institutional and substantive principles designed to promote constitutional purposes and to improve the operation of deliberative government in the post-New Deal period. All of the principles have at least some basis in current law, with some more firmly rooted than others. My goal, however, is not solely descriptive. All of the principles described here have justifications deriving from the constitutional backdrop, the promotion of sound institutional arrangements,
and the prevention of statutory irrationality and injustice. I outline the relevant justifications while discussing the norms.
In general, these principles are not designed to allow courts to depart from the approach prescribed by the agency conception of the judicial role where that approach leaves no ambiguity. In easy cases, the agency conception leads - with the inevitable aid of generally shared interpretive principles - to a clear result. The principles discussed in this Part are intended both as guides to statutory meaning and to fill gaps. Politically contestable background principles do not provide a license for courts to ignore the otherwise clear meaning of the statute. Sometimes, however, these principles will call for a more aggressive judicial role - requiring a clear legislative statement, for example, before interpreting congressional action to have violated constitutional norms or to have produced irrationality.
A. Sources and Scope of Interpretive Principles
z. The Domain of Institutional and Substantive Norms. Because this Part considers cases in which the traditional sources of meaning do not yield a single answer, I focus on norms that read legislative instructions in light of institutional or substantive concerns. Norms that perform the other two functions - orientation to meaning or capturing interpretive instructions - are not considered, except to the extent that norms serving institutional or substantive functions also serve those functions. In focusing on institutional and substantive norms, an initial question arises: when should they be applied?
In easy cases, substantive and institutional norms often seem unnecessary, and norms serving syntactic functions - mostly those so widely shared that they need not be identified - appear sufficient to resolve the case. But substantive and institutional norms are ubiquitous. Consider a federal environmental statute that allegedly preempts all of state tort law. The reason that it does not do so is not syntax alone, but syntax along with, and indeed inseparable from, a wide range of agreed-upon substantive and institutional understandings about, among other things, the limited preemptive effect of federal enactments and the appropriate role of the judiciary.
For these reasons, no cases can be resolved without reference to norms having substantive and institutional functions. But sometimes syntax or interpretive instructions, accompanied by other norms on which there is a wide consensus, are so clear that it would be wrong or unnecessary to introduce controversial substantive or institutional norms. This is a more precise formulation of the usually correct claim that substantive norms should not be permitted to override "the text."
Young v. Community Nutrition Institute18 provides an instructive example. Congress has instructed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that when dangerous substances are required in the preparation of food, "the Secretary shall promulgate regulations limiting the quantity therein or thereon to such extent as he finds necessary for the protection of public health, and any quantity exceeding the limits so fixed shall also be deemed to be unsafe." In Young, the FDA was asked to regulate the quantity of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic substance. Because "to such extent as he finds necessary" follows "thereon" rather than "regulations," the syntax of the provision suggests that when dangerous substances are required in the production of food, the Secretary must promulgate regulations setting a tolerance level. Under this reading, the words "to such extent as he finds necessary" allow the Secretary discretion to decide on the tolerance level but do not though perhaps not compelled by the text, this reading is strongly supported by the fact that an interpretation conferring on the Secretary discretion not to issue regulations would make the entire provision unnecessary. The discretion to promulgate or not already belonged to him. The Supreme Court, however, invoked the principle of deference to agency interpretations of law in order to uphold the FDA's view that the statute allows the Secretary not to promulgate regulations. This decision may be taken as an example of a case wrongly invoking a contestable institutional norm - deference to agency interpretations - in a context in which syntax and structure alone, accompanied by agreed-upon background norms, led to a single answer.
In other settings, however, norms that go to syntax or to interpretive instructions, even accompanied by generally held institutional and substantive understandings, will lead to uncertainty, to irrationality, or to an intrusion on constitutionally grounded arrangements. Conspicuous or contestable norms should be invoked only in narrowly defined settings: to "break ties" to require a clear statement before
reaching an outcome that would be absurd or would intrude upon constitutionally grounded arrangements to fill a gap or respond to a delegation of lawmaking power or to help decide what to do in the face of changed circumstances or the apparently irrational results of literaism.
Sources: In General. - Institutional and substantive norms are of course value-laden, and the choice among them is a subject of disagreement. Nevertheless, it is possible to identify sources of values, and values themselves, that are or deserve to be widely shared. The first and most straightforward source is the Constitution. Understandings about constitutional arrangements provide a significant amount of the background against which statutory construction occurs. To be sure, constitutional meaning is frequently uncertain, and statutory disputes are sometimes, in part, a function of a broader dispute about the best way to characterize the constitutional backdrop. Often, however, there is sufficient consensus about the meaning of the Constitution to ground a large part of interpretation. When no such consensus exists, the position one takes will be a function of a more narrowly held account of what the Constitution requires. Whether the position is persuasive depends on the reasons that can be marshaled on behalf of that account.
The second source of interpretive norms - also straightforward - consists of understandings about how statutory interpretation will improve or impair the performance of governmental institutions. Some such understandings are a firmly rooted and probably unavoidable part of interpretation. One might, for example, conclude that legislative history, produced by private groups and never enacted, is entitled to little weight or that appropriations statutes, written hastily and without deliberation, should be narrowly construed. If one were simply describing statutory construction as it is currently practiced, one would find a number of background norms traceable to understandings of precisely this sort.
The third and final source of background norms is more complex it emerges from the intended functions of regulatory statutes and the ways in which such statutes fail in practice. An understanding of dispensable not only to an appreciation of modern law, but also to an understanding of statutory construction. In hard cases, the familiar notion that statutes should be construed so as not to produce absurd
or irrational results is too abstract to be helpful one needs a particularized understanding of regulatory statutes. A detailed discussion of these points would be well beyond the scope of this Article, but a brief outline will be useful.
The goals of statutory regimes span a wide range. Some statutes are designed to promote economic efficiency, others to redistribute resources in public-regarding ways, to protect future generations from irreversible losses, to reflect nonmarket values or aspirations, to counteract the social subordination of disadvantaged groups, or to enforce the terms of pure interest-group deals. Moreover, statutes fail for a number of different reasons. Some are flawed in conception as a result of interest-group power, collective action problems, the absence of political accountability or political deliberation, changed circumstances or obsolescence, or lack of coordination with other statutes. Other statutes fail because of implementation problems. For example, a regulation may be based on a poor understanding of the way that the market can nullify its intended effects. Legislation apparently intended to protect consumers, workers, or tenants may have undesirable and unintended consequences. Finally, statutes designed to reduce or eliminate the social subordination of disadvantaged groups, or to promote public values like environmental quality and the protection of endangered species, frequently encounter in the implementation process the same obstacles - collective action prob19891
lems, the unrepresented character of future generations, and other disparities in political influence that make such statutes necessary
rfiimics Although conclusions of this sort are principally of interest to officials in the legislative and executive branches, they are relevant to the judiciary as well. Judicial conceptions of the likely function and potential failure of regulatory statutes inevitably shape legal interpretation. Moreover, such understandings will likely improve interpretation, for a sensitivity to regulatory failure can aid courts in promoting legislative goals in the face of textual ambiguities. Recognizing that conflicts among the principles will exist in some settings, I discuss rules of priority and harmonization below.
B. The Principles
Constitutional Norms. - Many constitutional norms deserve a prominent place in statutory interpretation. Some of them have been mentioned in Part I. The central point is that the Constitution provides the backdrop against which statutes are written and interpreted, and it furnishes the basic assumptions of interpretation.
Federal courts underenforce many constitutional norms, and for good reasons. Institutional constraints most notably, limited factfinding capability and attenuated electoral accountability make courts reluctant to vindicate constitutional principles with the vigor appropriate to governmental bodies with a better democratic and policymaking pedigree. As a result, there is a gap between what the Constitution actually requires and what constitutional courts are willing to require the political branches of government to do. In this context, courts should recognize that some statutes respond to Congress' constitutional responsibilities even if courts would not, for institutional reasons, require Congress to carry out those responsibilities in the first instance. Relatively aggressive statutory construction pushing statutes away from constitutionally troublesome ground provides a way for courts to vindicate constitutionally based norms and does so in a way that is less intrusive than constitutional adjudication.
(a) Avoiding Constitutional Invalidity and Constitutional Doubts.
The principle that statutes should be construed so as to survive
constitutional challenge serves a number of functions: it is a natural outgrowth of the system of separation of powers it minimizes interbranch conflict it responds to Congress' probable preference for validation over invalidation ("implicit interpretive instructions") and it strengthens judicially underenforced constitutional norms. The mild statutory "bending" that sometimes occurs is legitimate, for courts are not mere agents of the enacting legislature but have an obligation to the citizenry and the legal system as a whole.
This basic idea supports the broader principle, reflected in many cases, that courts should construe statutes to avoid not only constitutional invalidity but also constitutional doubts. This latter principle calls for a far more aggressive judicial posture in statutory construction, one that allows judicial "bending" of a greater range of statutes. Judge Posner criticizes this principle on the ground that it furnishes a kind of "judge-made 'penumbra"' around the Constitution, by allowing courts to press statutes in particular directions even though they would ultimately be found not to offend the Constitution. Judge Posner's objection becomes less forceful, however, in light of the fact that constitutional norms are often underenforced. As we have seen, there is a difference between what the Constitution requires and what the Supreme Court, interpreting the Constitution, is willing to compel. The aggressive construction of questionable but not invalid statutes - removing them from the terrain of constitutional uncertainty - is a less intrusive way of vindicating norms that do in fact have constitutional status.
(b) Federalism. - In the system of American public law, the basic assumption is that states have authority to regulate their own citizens and territory. This assumption justifies an interpretive principle requiring a clear statement before judges will find federal preemption
law.23 tionship between state and federal law in the particular context, this principle will frequently aid interpretation in disputed cases.
(c) Political Accountability Checks and Balances the Nondelegation Principle. - Some interpretive norms represent constitutionally inspired efforts to promote a sound allocation of institutional responsibility. Courts hesitate to interpret statutes as intruding on the President's power in foreign affairs, or as interfering with judicial power 1989]
Other interpretive strategies can be similarly understood. For example, courts have, since the New Deal, permitted Congress to delegate exceptionally broad policymaking authority to regulatory agencies. Such broad delegations were at one time thought to offend article I of the Constitution, which vests legislative power in Congress. In recent years, courts have been reluctant to enforce the nondelegation doctrine. This reluctance is partly attributable to the difficulty of developing standards for distinguishing between prohibited and permissible delegations, partly a product of the intrusiveness of any such judicial role, and partly a result of the frequent existence of good reasons for the delegation of discretionary power to regulatory agenThrough statutory construction, however, courts are sometimes able to vindicate the constitutional principle against delegation of legislative authority. They can do so, for example, by narrowly construing grants of policymaking power.
Various doctrines dealing with the degree of judicial deference to agency interpretations promote principles of nondelegation, accountability, and checks and balances. For example, the controversial proposition that courts should interpret congressional enactments on their own, without deferring to agency constructions, is intended to avoid the delegation problem that would arise if administrators could interpret the scope of their own authority. It is bad enough for administrators to have broad lawmaking power the problem is aggravated if administrators can judge the scope of whatever constraints Congress has imposed on them. As we have seen, courts should not permit foxes to guard henhouses. The exceptionally important idea that a delegation of power to an administrator implicitly permits presidential supervision and control similarly tries to promote political accountability. This idea promotes the constitutionally grounded
goals of a unitary executive branch: centralization, expedition, and accountability in law enforcement.
(d) The Rule of Law. In interpreting statutes, courts employ a clear-statement principle in favor of the "rule of law": a system in which legal rules exist, are clear rather than vague, do not apply retroactively, operate in the world as they do in the books, and do not contradict each other. The due process clause provides a constitutional basis for the rule of law ideal. The most celebrated aspect of this general idea is the rule of lenity, which leads courts to resolve ambiguities favorably to the criminal defendant.243 Courts also interpret statutes to minimize administrative discretion, to apply prospectively, and to require or permit rules. "[T]he law in general ... does not interpret a grant of discretion to eliminate all 'categorical rules."' (e) Political Deliberation the Constitutional Antipathy to Naked Interest-Group Transfers. - Designed to ensure a kind of deliberative democracy, the constitutional system is hostile to measures that impose burdens or grant benefits merely because of the political power of private groups. Governmental actions require some public This norm, firmly rooted in current law, has a number of implications for statutory interpretation. It suggests, for example, that courts should develop interpretive strategies that promote deliberation in government - by, for example, remanding issues involving constitutionally sensitive interests or groups for reconsideration by the legislature or by regulatory agencies when deliberation appears to have been absent. It also suggests that courts should narrowly construe statutes that embody mere interest-group deals. This principle does not authorize elaborate judicial review of legislative and administrative processes, but it does require a clear statement before courts will construe statutes as amounting to naked wealth transfers or as intruding into constitutionally sensitive areas.
(f) Hearing Rights. One of the most important functions of the Constitution is to provide procedural safeguards by affording rights to a hearing and to judicial review in cases involving important interests. The precise extent of these safeguards is sharply disputed. It is unclear, for example, whether Congress has the constitutional power to eliminate hearing rights for those seeking regulatory benefits,
In this area, courts often interpret statutes in the shadow of constitutional hearing rights. For this reason, courts narrowly interpret statutory provisions purporting to eliminate rights to a hearing and to judicial review. The ordinary presumption is that such rights are available, and that the constitutional issue therefore need not be resolved.
(g) Disadvantaged Groups. - Some of the most difficult questions in contemporary constitutional law involve the degree of protection afforded to disadvantaged groups by the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. In many of the cases, courts have afforded less protection than they otherwise might have because of a desire to minimize interferences with the democratic branches of government.
For example, in one of its most important and controversial decisions since World War II, the Supreme Court held that to establish a violation of the equal protection clause, blacks, women, and others must show "discriminatory intent" on the part of the enacting legislature. This requirement has furnished a significant barrier to constitutional complainants. It is best understood at least partly as an outgrowth of institutional concerns. If courts held that a disproportionate effect sufficed to raise constitutional doubts, a wide variety of governmental policies would be seriously questioned - an extremely intrusive outcome that might be inappropriate in light of the properly limited role of the judiciary in American government.
Courts have also invoked institutional considerations to justify an interpretation of the Constitution that affords little protection to certain groups, including most notably the handicapped and gays and
lesbians.253 In this light, statutes that provide protection for these groups, or against discriminatory effects, might well represent the legislature's response to its judicially underenforced constitutional responsibilities. Through statutory construction, courts can ensure that the relevant norms are vindicated. Aggressive construction of ambiguous statutes designed to protect disadvantaged groups provides a way for courts to protect the constitutional norm of equal protection in a less intrusive manner.
(h) Property and Contract Rights. In the aftermath of the New Deal reformation, courts have been reluctant to use the Constitution's explicit protection of property and contracts in a way that would seriously interfere with social and economic regulation. To a large degree, the reluctance is a product of the Court's substantive belief that redistributive goals fall within the state's police power under these clauses - a large shift from the understanding of the founding generation. Part of the Court's reluctance, however, derives from its belief that in the post-New Deal period, regulatory interferences with private contract and private property have considerable democratic support, and the judiciary ought to intervene only in egregious cases.
Whether or not the Court's unwillingness to provide more protection to rights of contract and property is justified, courts can vindicate those rights less intrusively by narrowly construing regulatory statutes that raise serious constitutional doubts under the contracts and takings clauses. commentators urged the Supreme Court to give constitutional protection to the right to minimum levels of subsistence. These claims 1989]
have plausible if not firm substantive roots in some of the most prominent theories of judicial review2 and in the New Deal reformation of the constitutional structure. There are, however, formidable institutional objections to such a judicial role, which would involve careful monitoring of a massive national bureaucracy. For the Supreme Court to undertake to protect welfare rights entirely on its own would raise serious questions of democratic legitimacy and remedial competence. Perhaps a Court that saw substantive force in the claim for constitutional welfare rights would attempt to vindicate that claim, not through the Constitution itself, but through aggressive statutory construction to ensure against irrational or arbitrary deprivations of benefits. Such an approach would tend to produce evenhandedness in the distribution of funds to the poor in a democracy that has committed itself to a "social safety net." Statutory construction, requiring a clear statement before allowing selective exclusions, might produce many of the advantages of recognition of welfare rights without imposing nearly so severe a strain on the judiciary.
Institutional Concerns. - A number of interpretive principles respond directly to institutional concerns and are designed to improve the performance of governmental entities. Most of these principles are straightforward and can be discussed quite briefly.
(a) Appropriations Statutes. - Courts construe appropriations provisions quite narrowly in light of judicial understandings about the character of the appropriations process, in which careful legislative deliberation is highly unlikely.26 Interest-group power is particularly likely to influence results in this context.
(b) A Cautious Approach to Legislative History. As Justice Scalia has emphasized, legislative history is sometimes written by one side or another in a dispute over the content of the law, and the history will sometimes reflect a view that could not prevail in the processes of congressional deliberation. In any case, the history is not law. Courts should therefore adopt a firm principle of the priority
specialized fact-finding and policymaking competence. The best reconciliation of these competing concerns would call for a principle requiring a clear legislative displacement of judicial review for judicial deference to agency decisions on facts, policy, and "mixed" questions having legal components and for independent judicial review of pure questions of law except where Congress has delegated interpretive power to the agency.
(g) Ratification, Acquiescence, Stare Decisis, and Post-Enactment History. - Although Congress' post-enactment views do not have the authority of law, stare decisis and post-enactment history should play a limited role in interpretation. Post-enactment history deserves the least deference. Like other legislative history, it can provide a sense of context, but it has the normal difficulties of unenacted views indeed, it is even worse than pre-enactment history in the sense that it is uninformative about the desires of the enacting Congress. On the other hand, evidence that part or all of Congress has endorsed a judicial construction or interpreted a statute in a particular way is important in furthering the goals of rationality, consistency, and coordination in interpretation. Stare decisis principles have traditionally served the same function of ensuring rationality and consistency, even though the previous decision may not have accurately understood the original meaning of the statute.
3. Counteracting Statutory Failure. - I have suggested that a number of interpretive principles in current law are intended to counteract failures in social and economic regulation.2 The general idea that statutory construction should combat characteristic pathologies in regulatory legislation is well-grounded in existing doctrine. In this section, I outline and defend a series of interpretive norms designed to promote this goal. Some of the particular norms have solid roots in current case law others are implicit still others find at best ambiguous support and are proposed here for the first time. I indicate the relationship between the suggested norms and current law in the particular discussions.
Courts should, I argue, try to avoid characteristic failures in regulation - caused, for example, by a failure to understand the systemic effects of regulation or to coordinate statutes regulating the same area. Courts should also be aware of the risks of overenforcement and underenforcement and therefore permit de minimis exceptions, assume proportionality in regulation, and generously construe statutes de-
Congress may and often does delegate to regulatory agencies and the (b) Taking Account of Collective Action Problems.2 Regulatory statutes are sometimes subverted in the implementation process, often as a result of the diffuse character of the class of regulatory beneficiaries. In one common scenario, the beneficiaries of regulatory programs, though numerous and ordinarily disorganized, are able to mobilize to obtain protective legislation. -As the statute is implemented, however, the group tends to dissipate, and well-organized members of the regulated class are able to exert continuing pressure on the agency. The regulatory program is skewed against effective implementation. Congress' words become purely symbolic, and inadequate implementation prevents the statute from accomplishing legislative goals. judicial interpretation of ambiguous statutes that takes account of this phenomenon will promote fidelity to these goals.
Many decisions appear to have reacted to the possibility that collective action problems will undermine regulatory programs. The most conspicuous examples are decisions aggressively construing regulatory statutes in order to protect the environment. The context presents a classic setting for regulatory "failure" resulting from collective action problems (not to mention unrepresented future generations, which cannot wield political power). Other illustrations include judicial decisions taking a careful look at administrative decisions that jeopardize the interests of regulatory beneficiaries. These decisions also respond to a perception that poorly organized beneficiaries are at risk during implementation, and that as a result, legislative goals will not be carried out in the real world.
Cases responding to overzealous regulation may be motivated by a similar concern.2 In this context, a collective action problem or structural infirmity may incline the agency toward excessive intrusion

of statutory systems into a coherent whole.
help explain Bob Jones University v. United States.29 This decision might be understood as an effort to ensure that the IRS takes account of the widespread social antagonism toward racial discrimination, as part of the general thrust of contemporary "public policy."
(d) Considering Systemic Effects. Regulation is frequently unsuccessful because of a failure to understand the complex systemic effects of governmental controls. Courts dealing with regulatory issues often act as if the decision will create only ex post winners and losers in the particular case. This misunderstanding leads to statutory construction that is uninformed by the real-world impact of regulation. Examples include the Supreme Court's OSHA decisions, in which several members of the Court appeared to assume that greater protection for workers would automatically follow from more stringent statutory requirements.2 This assumption is false. By requiring government to regulate to the point of "feasibility" and forbidding balancing of benefits and costs, stringent statutory requirements have at times harmed workers themselves. Faced with such onerous requirements, regulators have often underenforced the statute by failing to enforce the rules on the books or by refusing to issue rules at
Interpreting an environmental or occupational health law as especially protective may ultimately decrease regulatory protection. The problem of unintended or perverse side-effects is pervasive. Courts should understand the sometimes counterintuitive systemic consequences of different interpretations of regulatory statutes.
(e) Avoiding Private Law Principles. As suggested above, courts cannot properly invoke common law principles of private autonomy as the backdrop for interpreting public law.297 Suppose, for example, that a statute allows employees to file workers' compensation claims, and that an employer attempts to discharge an employee for filing such a claim. In this setting, courts should not invoke the background rule of at-will employment in order to uphold the discharge, even if the legislature has not explicitly displaced that rule in this context.2
The at-will rule would undermine the purpose of the workers' compensation statute. When the legislature intends to transform the relationships created by the common law, principles rooted in the common law do not provide an appropriate background rule.
Private law principles are wrongly applied in several areas of modern law. In interpreting the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),2 the Supreme Court has held that agency action is presumptively reviewable, but that agency inaction is presumptively unreviewable, in part because agency inaction is not "coercive." This understanding depends on an outmoded conception that finds coercion only in cases in which government intrudes on common law rights. Under this view, for example, the failure to protect against environmental harms or discrimination is not coercive at all. But the New Deal reformation, and the existence of social and economic regulation in general, are largely based on an understanding that the market creates a kind of coercion against which government must guard. For this reason, it is quite troublesome to use common law principles of coercion as the basis for creating a presumption against review of inadequate regulatory protection.
On occasion, the Court's treatment of the standing provisions of the APA30 has likewise disserved the goals of the legislature in enacting regulatory statutes. In some cases construing the APA, the Court has barred regulatory beneficiaries from seeking relief because they lacked a common law injury.30 In others, the Court has used a clear-statement principle in favor of continued judicial power to "balance the equities" in environmental cases and has thus decreased the likelihood of injunctive relief in such cases. In both of these contexts, the Court has used traditional private law principles in order to give content to modern public law in both settings, the resulting doctrine disserves the goals of the legislature.
(f) Avoiding Irrationality and Injustice. - A time-honored principle in Anglo-American law is that statutes should be construed to avoid irrationality and injustice, even whell the language of the statute seems to lead in that direction. The principle is controversial because there is no obvious basis for deciding whether an outcome is irrational, and because it is plausible to suggest that the correction for any such defect should come from the legislature rather than the courts. Because courts are able to focus upon the concrete and often unforeseeable effects of general statutory provisions, however, they are in a much better position to judge whether a particular provision produces peculiar consequences in a particular setting. The judgment that the consequence is peculiar and could not plausibly have been intended - is sometimes irresistible. On occasion the text, read literally, will appear to compel results that the legislature could not have anticipated and resolved in enacting a broad standard. It would be unrealistic to think that any legislature could or should correct every such problem.
In such circumstances, what might appear to be aggressive construction is entirely legitimate at least if the injustice or irrationality is palpable and there is no affirmative evidence that the legislature intended the result. Usually the interpretive issue in such cases resembles Wittgenstein's game of dice. Here it is fully plau-
Court's general hostility to the creation of implied rights of action finds an exception in the civil rights laws. In a number of cases, courts have created implied rights to protect disadvantaged groups in the face of an ambiguous text. A number of decisions reflect generous interpretations of statutes protecting the disabled. Responding to this rationale, courts have often aggressively construed statutes forbidding discrimination on the basis of race and sex3 - although recent cases suggest a movement in the opposite direction, perhaps
autonomy.3 An example here is Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, which involved the standards governing disparate-impact cases brought under title VII. In Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,321 the Court held that once a plaintiff showed that an employment practice had a discriminatory impact on members of a minority group, the burden shifted to the defendant to show that the practice was justified by "business necessity." In Wards Cove, the Court altered Griggs in two major ways. First, it held that the defendant's burden is one of production, not of persuasion, and the plaintiff must carry the burden of persuasion on the issue of business justification. Second, and more fundamentally, the Court held that the defendant need not show that a challenged practice is "'essential' or 'indispensable' to the employer's business." Instead, the question is "whether a challenged practice serves, in a significant way, the legitimate employment goals of the employer. The textual proscription of "discrimination" does not resolve the questions in Wards Cove. The text does not indicate whether discrim-
values. Those "nonmarket" values - reflected in laws regulating broadcasting and protecting the environment and endangered species
are often jeopardized in the post-enactment political "market," for the same reasons that nonmarket values are threatened by the willingness-to-pay criterion of the economic marketplace. If this characterization is accurate, an aggressive judicial role, combating a characteristic form of regulatory failure, is an appropriate way to achieve legislative- goals. In many decisions interpreting the "public interest" standard of the Federal Communications Act, courts have prodded the FCC to promote diversity, local control, local participation, and high-quality programming, and to work against racism and sexism in broadcasting all notwithstanding the fact that the market for broadcasting may fail to respect such norms. A similar solicitude for nonmarket values helps account for decisions taking a skeptical look at efforts to deregulate broadcasting and perhaps most notably for the aggressive judicial protection of the environment.
(i) Minimizing Interest-Group Transfers. Courts should narrowly construe statutes that serve no plausible public purpose, and amount merely to interest-group transfers. This idea is traceable to a basic constitutional norm335 and follows from the proportionality principle considered below. The idea helps explain a number of decisions
in areas of economic regulation, such as banking and agriculture. It also informs the courts' approach to the Robinson-Patman Act and their effort to understand the Sherman Act as an attempt to promote consumer welfare rather than as protection of small business as When a public purpose is palpably absent, this principle should be unexceptionable.
(j) Requiring Proportionality. Another interpretive principle would understand statutes to impose benefits roughly commensurate with their costs, unless there is a clear legislative statement to the contrary. This proportionality norm, implicit in several recent cases, draws on an understanding of likely legislative purpose and on perceptions about regulatory failure. Statutes often fail because of excessive controls or inadequate implementation, and courts should generally assume that Congress wants to avoid those problems and therefore intends agencies to impose regulations after a balancing
may produce harmful systemic consequences as well as overregulation. Ironically, it will also produce severe underregulation. Moreover, bureaucratic self-interest or factional pressures sometimes incline agencies toward overzealous enforcement, which Congress is unable routinely to monitor or remedy. The proportionality norm is reinforced as well by interpretive norms calling for legislative deliberation. It leads to narrow construction of statutes enacted as a result of interestgroup pressure or as myopic or impulsive reactions to short-term problems.
The difficulty with this principle is that there is no uncontroversial metric with which to measure social costs and social benefits. If courts understand benefits and costs technically - as in the economic formulation - and make the assessment turn on private willingness to pay, they will undervalue aspirations and nonmarket values and ultimately undermine statutory The very decision to create a regulatory system often reflects a rejection of private willingness to pay as the criterion of social choice. Many statutes are designed to transform rather than to implement preferences, to redistribute resources, or to reflect the outcome of a deliberative process about relevant public values. Moreover, a statute that protects (for example) endangered species may have symbolic or aspirational benefits. The various values that are served by regulatory programs should be treated hospitably.
For these reasons, the proportionality principle is most useful for cases of economic regulation. It becomes most workable when it is clear, by reference to a widely held social consensus, that the social benefits are small in comparison to the social costs. Even in cases of public aspirations or nonmarket values, the proportionality idea should be invoked when the disadvantages of regulation seem to dwarf the advantages, at least when the statute is ambiguous.
(k) Allowing de Minimis Exceptions. It follows from the proportionality principle that regulatory statutes should ordinarily be understood to contain de minimis exceptions. In such cases, the costs of regulation outweigh the benefits, which are by hypothesis insubstantial. Moreover, the failure to allow de minimis exceptions will
probably decrease rather than increase health and Administrators should be allowed to refuse to impose costly regulations for highly speculative or minimal gains. Many courts have reached precisely this conclusion. Indeed, courts should probably require such exceptions in the absence of an explicit statutory text or plausible substantive justifications to the contrary.
4. Examples. - Two important cases involving the meaning of the Occupational Safety and Health Act illustrate the basic framework. The pertinent language of the statute34 directs OSHA to promulgate the standard that "most adequately assures, to the extent feasible . . . that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exlife."'35 statute also contains a general definition of "occupational safety and health standard," which says that the term refers to measures that safe or healthful employment and places of '
In Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute,352 the Supreme Court invalidated an OSHA regulation of benzene. Although the precise consequences of the regulation were sharply contested, there was evidence that the regulation would impose enormous costs in exchange for small or speculative gains. OSHA itself concluded that its regulation would require capital investments of $266 million, first-year operating costs of $187 to
There was therefore a ready political corrective both to the plurality's conclusion, if it was contrary to public consensus, and to inadequate implementation in general. For all these reasons, the plurality correctly interpreted OSHA to require a showing of a significant risk as a predicate for regulation.
In American Textile Manufacturers Institute v. Donovan,3 the Supreme Court decided a question left open in American Petroleum: whether the OSHA statute required cost-benefit analysis. In arguing that it did, the industry contended that the word "feasible" required OSHA not only to show a significant risk, but also to demonstrate that the benefits of regulation justified the costs. "Feasibility," in the industry's view, contemplated a balancing of costs and benefits. The government contended that once OSHA had shown a significant risk, it could regulate to the point where the survival of the regulated industry would be endangered by additional controls. For the government, the term "feasibility" did not connote cost-benefit balancing,
In accepting the government's argument, the Court relied on the dictionary definition of "feasible" to conclude that the term meant "'capable of being done, executed, or effected,"' rather than justified by a balancing of costs and benefits. This literal approach to the statute was not entirely unreasonable. The structure of the toxic substances provision - consider the "no employee shall suffer" language - is in considerable tension with the industry's construction. Moreover, Congress has sometimes used the term "feasible" as a selfconscious alternative to "cost-benefit" balancing, and that fact argues against the view that the two terms have the same meaning. But the same principles that support the decision in American Petroleum cast serious doubt on American Textile Manufacturers.
Notwithstanding the statute's language, it is probably unrealistic to believe that Congress actually focused on, and resolved, the ques-
circumstances, at least when the statutory text is ambiguous. Such an approach is likely to produce greater coherence in the law to reduce the problem, pervasive in modern government, of regulation by measures that are badly out of date and to lead to a legal system that is both more rational and more consistent with democratic norms. It is tempting but inadequate to say that the legislature should respond to the problem of changed circumstances. The question is what the statute means in those circumstances, and that question must be answered by those who interpret it, including the courts. This claim does not, of course, mean that changed circumstances should be understood to authorize courts to amend or rewrite statutes, but it does mean that "meaning" is itself a function of those circumstances. 71
The problem of changed circumstances presents questions not only of statutory meaning in new settings, but also of implicit interpretive instructions: how would Congress have wanted courts to approach its enactments in the face of obsolescence or changed circumstances? There will rarely be a direct answer to this question. As in constitutional law, the problem of changed circumstances requires courts to decide whether the content of legal rules should change when there have been changes in law, policy, and fact. At the very least, courts should answer in the affirmative when a statute contains an openended term like "public policy" or "psychopathic that invites interpretations that change over time when statutory language already contains an ambiguous term ("feasible") whose meaning depends on current conditions or when the statute contains a phrase ("induce cancer") that has been rendered ambiguous because of changed circumstances. Even when no clear interpretive instructions allow a judge to adapt statutory terms to new conditions, courts may do so when those conditions have rendered a statute ambiguous. This problem typically occurs in three ways. First, the factual assumptions underlying the
original statute may no longer be valid. For example, statutes regulating broadcasting were enacted with the understanding that because of the limitations of the spectrum, few broadcasting licenses would be available. In the face of new technology and the rise of cable television, that assumption has become hopelessly unrealistic.
Second, a statutory provision may no longer be consistent with widely held social norms. In such cases a court must ask whether this change so alters the landscape that a reading of the statute that does not accord with the original understanding of its authors is justified - a question the enacting legislature may well have intended courts to answer in the affirmative.
Third, the legal background may have changed dramatically as a result of legislative and administrative innovations. A statute enacted in may have ignored environmental considerations widely recognized in statutes enacted after I96O. The question is whether the change in the legal background has consequences for interpreting the
Judicial responses to all three kinds of obsolescence are not difficult to find. The first kind has resulted in aggressive construction, particularly in banking and broadcasting. In light of the changed nature of the relevant markets, it is implausible to resolve ambiguities by examining Congress' intent at the time of enactment. Such an approach would be a recipe for absurdity, and absurdity would hardly promote legislative purposes.
The second form of obsolescence is reflected in judicial construction to take account of environmental concerns. In this context, the legal backdrop has changed so dramatically that seemingly straightforward interpretation of the old statutes would be undesirable. The same point helps to explain the courts' narrow construction of provisions of the UCC not anticipating the revolution in the law of products liability.3 similar terms. Changing legislative and judicial developments had made racial discrimination inconsistent with "public policy" in the r98o's, even if no such inconsistency existed when the charitable deduction was first enacted.
Decisions reading ambiguous statutes to require regulatory agencies to consider costs and benefits illustrate the third form of judicial response to obsolescence. The Court may also have been reflecting
contemporary values in reading the Sherman Act as an effort to promote consumer welfare. The underlying argument would be that a welfare-based interpretive principle is the only basis for a judicially administrable standard, and that such a principle conforms best to current understandings about a well-functioning antitrust law.38 Several substantive norms apply to cases of obsolescence. Obsolete statutes are by hypothesis inconsistent with other regulation or with the current legal framework. They may also have pernicious, if unintended, systemic effects. If the text allows, courts should attempt to harmonize such statutes with current circumstances.
We might explore the problem of obsolescence in more detail by examining the Delaney Clause. As noted above, the clause prohibits the sale of food additives that "induce cancer when ingested by man or animal" or are found "after tests which are appropriate for the evaluation of the safety of food additives, to induce cancer in man and animal." As we have seen, the drafters of the clause believed that few additives caused cancer, and that those that did so were extremely dangerous. By the I98o's, however, it was clear that many
Congress that enacted the Delaney Clause. Indeed the clause, read it banned substances that posed no real risk to health. Having been
manufacturers instead used additives that caused more serious risks of other diseases - thus creating what was quite possibly a significant increase in illnesses and deaths from food additives. In response, the FDA - invoking background principles against obsolescence and in favor of rationality and de minimis exception - interpreted the clause to permit the exemption of trivial risks. The claim, in short, was that changed circumstances made the word "induce" ambiguous. The FDA said that it would approve food additives that posed a de minimis risk of cancer.
The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that the FDA's position was unlawful. In that court's view, the Delaney Clause was unambiguous on the point. Read in context, however, the statute's meaning was far from clear. Because Congress did not focus on the question of de minimis risks in its original enactment, a de minimis exception would not have defeated Congress' will. The factual background against which the Delaney Clause was written was so different from the present circumstances that the statutory terms "induce cancer" must be treated as ambiguous. The word "induce" should be read in its setting: whether a substance "induces" cancer within the meaning of the clause might well be a function of the degree of risk that it poses. We have seen that where there has been no clear legislative statement, agencies should be free to create de minimis exceptions to regulation. In these circumstances, interpretation of the clause to permit such exceptions seems consistent with permissible understandings of statutory construction, and quite sensible to boot. The D.C. Circuit's decision to the contrary was therefore misguided.
D. Priority and Harmonization
It will not have escaped notice that the interpretive principles I have proposed will sometimes conflict with one another. For example, the principle favoring state authority might collide with the principle favoring disadvantaged groups, and the presumption against amendment through the appropriations process might contradict the principle in favor of generous construction of statutes protecting nonmarket values. The examples could easily be multiplied. The possibility of conflict renders the basic approach vulnerable to a neo-realist objection that, in practice, the interpretive norms will provide contradictory guidance for the judiciary.
Principles of harmonization and priority can in fact be developed to resolve cases of conflict. To make this claim is not, however, to say that the application of interpretive norms can be purely mechan-
ical. Inevitably, statutory construction is an exercise of practical reason, in which text, history, and purpose interact with background understandings in the legal culture. In light of the dependence of outcomes on particular contexts, a fully systematized approach to statutory construction would be unmanageable. But short of a complete system, it is possible to develop some guidelines.
Priority. The first task is to develop principles by which to rank interpretive norms. Although different judges and administrators will rank such norms in different ways, it should be possible to achieve a more precise understanding of statutory construction - both as a descriptive and as a normative matter - by generating a hierarchy of interpretive principles.
In that hierarchy, the presumptions in favor of decisions by politically accountable actors and in favor of political deliberation should occupy the very highest place. The principle of political accountability has a clear foundation in article I of the Constitution, is an overriding structural commitment of the document, has roots in assessments of institutional performance, and is also designed to counteract characteristic failures in the regulatory process. In this sense, the norm of political accountability draws on all three basic sources of interpretive principles.
The commitment to political deliberation belongs on the same plane. The belief in deliberative democracy is also a basic constitutional commitment. Implicit in the systems of checks and balances and federalism, it draws on Madison's conception of political representation. The absence of deliberation has also contributed to regulatory failure. In these ways, the belief in political deliberation and the belief in political accountability are closely allied.
Other interpretive principles traceable to constitutional norms deserve great respect. They should occupy the next highest position in the hierarchy. This category would include the norms in favor of broad interpretation of statutes protecting disadvantaged groups, against delegations of legislative authority, in favor of state autonomy, and in favor of narrow construction of interest-group transfers. As we have seen, all of these principles have constitutional status but are underenforced as a result of the institutional position of the judiciary.3 Moreover, it is possible to create a kind of hierarchy within constitutionally based interpretive principles. Thus, for example, the
principle in favor of state autonomy should occupy a lower place than the principle in favor of protection of disadvantaged groups, which is the product of the fourteenth amendment, a self-conscious attempt to limit the scope of state power. The case law in fact reflects this
Finally, interpretive principles without constitutional status should occupy the lowest rung, precisely because the judgments they represent are not so closely connected with the foundational commitments of American constitutionalism. This category includes norms in favor of coordination and of proportionality, norms requiring consideration of systemic effects, norms against implied repeals, and norms against obsolescence. All these norms should play a less significant role in cases of conflict. Moreover, these principles might themselves be placed in lexical order. For example, the principles calling for de minimis exceptions and for proportionality, and for taking account of systemic effects, should occupy the highest position among nonconstitutional principles. To use (for example) the principle calling for broad construction of statutes favoring nonmarket values as a reason to abandon proportionality would sacrifice those very values - because of the likelihood that stringent regulation that bars balancing will produce regulatory irrationality and, ultimately, underregulation. The background principles calling for proportionality and de minimis exceptions, and requiring consideration of systemic effects, should ordinarily apply unless a constitutional principle trumps them.
Harmonization. - Principles of harmonization are designed not to rank interpretive norms but to minimize the number of conflicts among norms. For example, courts should apply the proportionality principle differently when nonmarket values are at stake. In cases of economic regulation, translating costs and benefits into dollars, measured in terms of private willingness to pay, is entirely sensible. In cases implicating nonmonetary values, the fact that monetized costs and benefits are disproportionate is not controlling. Reflecting a similar understanding, the courts have interpreted statutes quite generously, and in a way that conspicuously departs from private willingness to pay, when aspirations and noncommodity values are involved.
Another principle of harmonization would recognize that cases turn not simply on the applicability of interpretive norms, but also on the degree of their infringement. Thus, for example, an enormous grant of discretionary lawmaking power to a regulatory agency would argue more strongly in favor of an aggressive narrowing construction than a minor grant of such power. Moreover, if the norm in favor of
limited delegations conflicts with the norm in favor of coordination of regulatory policy, the degree of the infringement on both norms would be highly relevant to the decision.
3. An Illustration - Pennhurst. - Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman illustrates the operation of principles of priority and harmonization. In Pennhurst, a group of mentally retarded people brought suit against a mental health facility that was found to contain dangerous conditions. Many of the residents had been physically abused, brutally mistreated, or drugged the facility was utterly inadequate for the treatment of the retarded. As the basis of their legal claim, the plaintiffs invoked the "bill of rights" in the bill of rights contained a set of legislative findings, including the following:
(i) Persons with developmental disabilities have a right to appropriate
treatment, services, and habilitation for such disabilities.
(2) The treatment, services, and habilitation for a person with developmental disabilities should be designed to maximize the developmental potential of the person and should be provided in a setting
that is least restrictive of the person's personal liberty.
(3) The Federal Government and the States both have an obligation
to assure that public funds are not provided to any institution]...
that] does not provide treatment, services, and habilitation which is
....
The question in Pennhurst was whether the bill of rights created legally enforceable rights, or whether it instead enacted a set of goals or aspirations that could not be vindicated in court. The history of the Act supported an argument that Congress intended to create legally cognizable rights. On the other hand, it was not unreasonable to suggest that the bill of rights should be taken, like some other prefaces to legislation, as a statement of goals and purposes that amounted to an essentially precatory statement of congressional aspirations - a statement that would not permit the developmentally disabled to bring suit against a facility that failed to respect the bill of rights. There was no affirmative indication that the "findings" were intended to give rise to legally enforceable rights, costing the state enormous sums. Without a background interpretive principle, the case was probably impossible to resolve.
It follows that when Congress has taken steps to provide safeguards for that group, the Court should take into account the fourteenth amendment and the underenforced character of the equality norm in order to give statutes involving the disabled a hospitable rather than a grudging interpretation. The Pennhurst Court should not have relied on a background norm in favor of federalism in order to render meaningless a statutory provision involving a group and a right safeguarded by the fourteenth amendment.
E. A Concluding Note: The Post-Canonical Universe
What would the universe of statutory interpretation be like if all of these proposals were accepted? In one sense, it would not be dramatically different from the one we inhabit. All of the principles suggested here have some foundations in current law. A system of interpretation without interpretive norms, even substantive and institutional ones, would be inconceivable. On the other hand, a legal system that adopted such principles self-consciously would have a far greater degree of uniformity and coherence. It would be especially responsive to constitutional norms, to institutional considerations, and to an informed understanding of the functions and failures of the modern regulatory state. Above all, the system would rely on norms that promote the goals and that improve the performance of statutory regimes, and it would use the process of statutory construction as a corrective against some of the pervasive weaknesses, injustices, and irrationalities of modern regulation.
In all likelihood, a set of explicitly articulated interpretive norms would elicit administrative and legislative responses. In time, members of Congress, and others involved in the lawmaking process, would become aware of those norms and would enact statutes in the shadow of such norms. Some statutes would look quite different, for Congress would know that courts would, in the face of statutory silence or ambiguity, press legislation in one direction rather than another.403 Judicial adoption of interpretive norms of this sort would
ultimately shift the burden of legislative inertia - giving rationality of various sorts the benefit of the doubt, and raising the costs of absurdity or injustice - and at the same time would offer legislators and others a clear rather than murky background against which to do their work.
The interpretive norms suggested here would convert some hard cases into easy ones, by providing principles with which to decide cases that might otherwise be in equipoise. Examples include cases like American Petroleum, which involved the operation of the proportionality principle, and cases involving allegations of preemption, which implicate the principle in favor of state autonomy. But the norms would also make some easy cases into hard ones, by shifting the legal backdrop and requiring clear legislative instructions before certain results could be reached. For this reason, a legal framework pervaded by explicit background norms of the sort outlined here would in some settings create rather than diminish legal uncertainty. This cost, however, is a small price to pay for increased clarity in a variety of contexts, and, much more fundamentally, an improvement in the performance of regulatory law, an increase in rationality, and a greater sensitivity to the constitutional backdrop, statutory function, and regulatory failure.
The traditional understandings of statutory construction are inadequate. They fail to describe existing practice or to set out an approach that deserves support. Under the approach suggested here, the statutory text is the foundation for interpretation, but structure, purpose, intent, history, and "reasonableness" all play legitimate roles. It is possible, moreover, to distinguish among those roles, and thus to produce a system in which dictionary definitions of statutory terms ordinarily suffice, but are subject to various forms of contextual qualification. As complete theories of interpretation, however, all of the traditional sources depend on fictions or leave large interpretive gaps. Efforts to approach statutes as "deals," or to justify a general background rule in favor of either administrative interpretation or "private ordering, cannot be defended, for they produce indeterminacy, lead
to an inferior system of law, or depend on values that were repudiated by the decision to create the regulatory regime in the first instance.
Because language "by itself" lacks meaning, and in light of the existence of gaps or ambiguities in hard cases, interpretive principles of various sorts are desirable and in any case inevitable. Interpretation cannot occur without background principles that fill gaps in the face of legislative silence and provide the backdrop against which to read linguistic commands. In easy cases, the text, in conjunction with generally held interpretive principles, is enough to solve interpretive disputes in other cases, also relatively easy, a resort to purpose, context - including legislative history - or reasonableness will be proper, necessary, and sufficient. In many cases, however, courts must invoke interpretive principles that appear controversial.
Some such principles aid courts in discerning the meaning of particular statutes, or help to implement Congress' actual or likely interpretive instructions. Others are rooted in constitutional concerns others derive from assessments of institutional performance still others attempt to respond to characteristic failings of regulatory legislation. Because statutory meaning is a function of interpretive principles and cannot exist without them, something like "canons" of construction, far from being obsolete, must occupy a prominent place in the theory and practice of statutory interpretation.
In these circumstances, it is especially important to avoid thiee common errors. The first is to treat interpretive principles as the illegitimate intrusion of discretionary policy judgments into "ordinary" interpretation as we have seen, there is no such thing. The second is to think that the existence of competing, and value-laden, principles is a reason to give up on the enterprise of statutory construction altogether, and in hard cases to resort to a sometimes fictional "plain language," to treat interpretation as inevitably indeterminate, or to rest content with the conclusion that statutes turn out to mean what people in authority say that they mean. Even in hard cases, it is possible to mediate among competing principles and to assess them in terms of their sensitivity to constitutional structure, to institutional arrangements, and to regulatory function and failure. The third error is to use traditional principles of private law - carried over from anachronistic conceptions of the relationship between the citizen and the state - to resolve disputes about the meaning of modern enactments.
The interpretive principles suggested here are intended for the President, regulatory agencies, and Congress, as well as for the courts. Even more fundamentally, they provide a basis for understanding the ideas that underlie the fabric of the modern regulatory state. Indeed, it is in disputes over background norms of interpretation that one finds principles that organize and divide understandings not only of the New Deal reformation, but of American constitutionalism and democracy as a whole.
The ultimate task is to develop a set of interpretive norms sensitive to constitutional structure, institutional design, the New Deal reformation, and the diverse functions and failings of governmental actors and statutory regimes - with which to approach social and economic regulation in a system that has largely abandoned common law categories. It is possible to generate a series of interpretive principles, all with support in current law, that can promote the goals of deliberative government in the post-New Deal period. In this way, statutory construction can serve as an ally of other, more ambitious strategies designed to promote some of the original constitutional goals in a dramatically changed legal environment. It is far too much to expect statutory construction to respond to all of the failings of the modern regulatory state. But it is not too much to expect that the process of interpretation can make the situation better rather than worse.
