        <p>When strong emotions are triggered by a risk, people show a remarkable tendency to neglect a
small probability that the risk will actually come to fruition. Experimental evidence, involving
electric shocks and arsenic, supports this claim, as does real-world evidence, involving responses
to abandoned hazardous waste dumps, the pesticide Alar, and anthrax. The resulting “probability
neglect” has many implications for law and policy. It suggests the need for institutional
constraints on policies based on ungrounded fears; it also shows how government might
effectively draw attention to risks that warrant special concern. Probability neglect helps to
explain the enactment of certain legislation, in which government, no less than ordinary people,
suffers from that form of neglect. When people are neglecting the fact that the probability of harm
is small, government should generally attempt to inform people, rather than cater to their
excessive fear. But when information will not help, government should respond, at least if
analysis suggest that the benefits outweigh the costs. The reason is that fear, even if it is
excessive, is itself a significant problem, and can create additional significant problems.</p>
        <p>“If someone is predisposed to be worried, degrees of unlikeliness seem to
provide no comfort, unless one can prove that harm is absolutely impossible,
which itself is not possible.”1</p>

terrorists wage germ warfare? Where is the line between reasonable precaution
and panic? Jittery, uncertain and assuming the worst, many people have
answered these questions by forswearing air travel, purchasing gas masks and
radiation detectors, placing frantic calls to pediatricians demanding vaccinations

      <title>I. Preface: Terrorism’s Aftermath</title>
      <p>This is an essay about the role of the emotions in producing responses to
risks, and in particular about how strong emotions lead people to neglect the
probability that a risk will come to fruition. I started writing the essay a few days
before the terrorist attacks on Washington, DC and New York City on September
11, 2001. It goes without saying that in the immediate aftermath of those attacks,
people became exceedingly frightened. Many people were saying, “you cannot
be safe anywhere.” They were especially afraid to fly. In response to the attacks,
new security measures at airports were imposed at airports. There was a
significant reduction in flying. One reason was simple fear. Another reason was
the increased inconvenience (and to that extent cost, monetary and otherwise) of
flying. Many people drove who would have flown; many others stayed at home.</p>
      <p>For those who study the topic of risk regulation, there are many things to
say about this state of affairs. First, safety is a matter of degree; it is foolish to
worry, as people seemed to be doing, about whether they are “safe” or “not
safe.” As a statistical matter, most people, in most places (not excluding airports),
were not at significantly more risk after the attacks than they were before.
Second, the result of the new security measures might have been to increase
deaths on balance.4 It is entirely possible that the new measures saved no lives at
all. In addition, any substitution of driving for flying is likely to cause deaths,
because driving is a less safe method of transportation.5 Perhaps hundreds of
lives, on balance, will ultimately be lost as a result of the new security measures.6
Third, the costs of the new measures might well outweigh the benefits. As noted,
there might be no benefits at all. Once monetized, the various costs are likely to
be huge, undoubtedly in the billions. The sensible technocrat asks: Should we
not, therefore, reject at least some of the new security measures, on the ground
that they fail both health-health balancing and cost-benefit balancing?</p>
      <p>It is not at all clear that the sensible technocrat is wrong. But things are not
so obvious. People were afraid to fly, and they demanded stringent security
measures. Indeed few people publicly objected to them; it is hard to find a single
person who was willing to launch a public objection on technocratic grounds. (It
is an interesting question whether people objected to them privately and were

silencing themselves, and if so exactly why.7) Perhaps fewer people would fly,
and more people would die, without those measures. This too is a technical
question. But the demand for stringent security measures itself reflected the fact
that people would have felt distressed, or upset, or fearful if government did not
respond. A failure to respond would itself have imposed costs. One point seems
clear: An effort to assess the costs of airplane crashes, and terrorism, will be
ludicrously incomplete if it does not take account of the consequences of
emotional reactions, which are themselves costs, and which will impose
significant additional costs. I flew myself, about a week after the attacks, and
while I believed that that the probability of danger was very low, I was not at all
comfortable about flying, and the day before the flight was pretty miserable.</p>

    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>II. Emotions, Probability Neglect, and the Worst Case</title>
      <p>On the conventional view of rationality, emotions, as such, are not assessed
independently; they are not taken to play a distinctive role.8 Of course people
might be risk-averse or risk-inclined. It is possible, for example, that people will
be willing to pay $100 to eliminate a 1/1000 risk of losing $900. But analysts do
not generally ask, or care, whether these dispositions are a product of emotions
or something else.</p>
      <p>What can be said for the conventional view of rationality can also be said for
prospect theory, a less conventional view about decision under risk.9 Prospect
theory emphasizes a number of anomalies in people’s reactions to risks. For
present purposes, what is most important is that prospect theory offers an
explanation for simultaneous gambling and insurance.10 When given the choice,
many people will reject a certain gain of X in favor of a gamble with an expected
value below X, if the gamble involves a small probability of riches. At the same
time, people prefer a certain loss of X to a gamble with an expected value less
than X, if the gamble involves a small probability of catastrophe.11 If expected
utility theory is taken as normative, then people depart from the normative
theory of rationality in giving excessive weight to low-probability outcomes
when the stakes are high. But in making these descriptive claims, prospect theory
does not set out a special role for emotions. Nor is this a puzzling oversight, if it
counts as an oversight at all. For many purposes, what matters is what people
choose, and it is unimportant to know whether their choices depend on cognition
or emotion, whatever may be the difference between these two terms.</p>
      <p>No one doubts, however, that in many domains, emotions have a large effect
on judgment and decisionmaking.12 With some low-probability events,
anticipated and actual emotions help to determine choice. Those who buy lottery
tickets, for example, often fantasize about the goods associated with a lucky
outcome.13 With respect to risks of harm, many of our ordinary ways of speaking
suggest strong emotions: panic, hysteria, terror. People might refuse to fly, for
example, not because they are currently frightened, but because they anticipate
their own anxiety, and they want to avoid it. It is well known that people often
decide as they do because they anticipate their own regret.14 The same is true for
fear. Knowing that they will be afraid, people may refuse to travel to the Israel or
South Africa, even if they would much enjoy seeing those nations and even if
they believe, on reflection, that their fear is not entirely rational. Recent evidence
is quite specific.15 It suggests that people’s aversion to a small probability of an
especially bad outcome is heightened when the outcome is “affect rich” – when it
involves not simply a serious loss, but one that produces strong emotions,
including fear.16</p>
      <p>Drawing on and expanding this evidence, I will emphasize a single
phenomenon here. Sometimes people focus on the worst possible case, which
triggers strong emotions. When this is so, people fail to inquire into the
probability that the worst case will occur. In such cases, emotions lead to what I
will call probability neglect, which is properly treated as a form of
quasirationality.17 From the normative point of view, it is not fully rational to treat a
1% chance of X as equivalent, or nearly equivalent, to a 99% chance of X, or even
a 10% chance of X. Because people suffer from probability neglect, and because
neglecting probability is not fully rational, the phenomenon I identify casts
additional doubt on the widespread idea that ordinary people have a kind of
“richer rationality” superior to that of experts.18 Most of the time, experts are
concerned principally with the number of lives at stake,19 and for that reason
they will be closely attuned, as ordinary people are not, to the issue of
probability.</p>
      <p>It is not at all clear how the law should respond to this form of
quasirationality. I will suggest that at a minimum, an understanding of probability
neglect will help to understand how government and law might accomplish
shared social goals. If government wants to insulate itself from probability
neglect, it will create institutions designed to ensure that genuine risks, rather
than tiny ones, receive the most concern. Such institutions will not require
agencies to discuss the worst-case scenario.20 And if government is attempting to
increase public concern with a genuine danger, it should not emphasize statistics
and probabilities, but should instead draw attention to the worst case scenario.
An understanding of probability neglect will also help us to make better
predictions about the public “demand” for law. When a bad outcome is highly
salient and triggers strong emotions, government will be asked to do something
about it, even if the probability of the bad outcome is low.</p>
      <p>For law, the most difficult questions seem to be normative in character.
Should government respond to intense fears that involve statistically remote
risks? When people suffer from probability neglect, should law and policy do the
same thing? I suggest that if it can, government should attempt to educate and
inform people, rather than capitulating to unwarranted public fear. On the other
hand, public fear, however unwarranted, may be intractable, in the sense that it
is impervious to efforts at reassurance. And if public fear is intractable, it will
cause serious problems, because fear is itself extremely unpleasant, and because
fear is likely to influence conduct, producing (for example) wasteful and
excessive private precautions. If so, a governmental response, via regulatory
safeguards, would appear to be justified if the benefits, in terms of fear
reduction, justify the costs.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>III. Probability Neglect: The Basic Phenomenon</title>
      <p>Many experiments suggest that when it comes to risk, a key question is
whether people can imagine or visualize the “worst case” outcome.21 When the
worst case produces intense fear, little role is played by the stated probability
that that outcome will occur.22 An important function of strong emotions is thus
to drive out quantitative judgments, including judgments about probability, by
making the best case or the worst case seem highly salient.23 By way of preface,
however, it is important to note that a great deal of evidence shows that whether
or not emotions are involved, people are relatively insensitive to differences in
probabilities, at least when the relevant probabilities are low.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>A. Insensitivity to Variations among Low Probabilities</title>
      <p>Do people care about probability at all? Of course they do. But some people,
some of the time, show a remarkable unwillingness to attend to that issue.
Several studies show that when people are seeking relevant information, they
often do not try to learn about the issue of probability. One study, for example,
finds that in deciding to purchase warranties for consumer products, people do
not spontaneously point to the probability of needing repair as a reason for the
purchase.24 Another study finds that those making hypothetical risky managerial
decisions rarely ask for data on probabilities.25 Perhaps these findings reflect
people’s implicit understanding that in these settings, the relevant probability
“low, but not zero,” and that finer distinctions are unhelpful. And indeed, many
studies find that significant differences in (low) probabilities have little impact on
decisions. This finding is in sharp conflict with the standard view of rationality,
which suggests that people’s willingness to pay for small risk reductions ought
to be nearly proportional to the size of the reduction.26 In an especially striking
study, Kunreuther and his coauthors found that mean willingness to pay
insurance premiums did not vary among risks of 1 in 100,000, 1 in 1 million, and
1 in 10 million.27 They also found basically the same willingness to pay for
insurance premiums for risks ranging from 1 in 650, to 1 in 6300, to 1 in 68,000.28</p>
      <p>The study just described involved a “between subjects” design; subjects
considered only one risk, and the same people were not asked to consider the
several risks at the same time. But several studies have a “within subjects”
design, and even here, differences in low probabilities have little effect on
decisions. An early study examined people’s willingness to pay (WTP) to reduce
travel fatality risks. The central finding was that the mean WTP to reduce fatality
risk by 7/100,000 was merely 15% higher than the mean WTP to reduce the risk
by 4/100,000.29 A later study found that for serious injuries, WTP to reduce the
risk by 12/100,000 was only 20% higher than WTP to reduce the same risk by
4/100,000.30 These results are not unusual. Lin and Milon attempted to elicit
people’s willingness to pay to reduce the risk of illness from eating oysters.31
There was little sensitivity to variations in probability of illness.32 A similar study
found little change in WTP across probability variations involving exposure to
pesticides residues on fresh produce.33 A similar anomaly was found in a study
involving hazardous wastes, where WTP actually decreased as the stated fatality
risk reduction decreased.34</p>
      <p>There is much to say about the general insensitivity to significant variations
within the category of low-probability events. It would be difficult to produce a
rational explanation for this insensitivity; recall the standard suggestion that
WTP for small risk reductions should be roughly proportional to the size of the
reduction.35 Why don’t people think in this way? An imaginable explanation is
that in the abstract, most people simply do not know how to evaluate low
probabilities. A risk of 7/100,000 seems “small”; a risk of 4/100,000 also seems
“small.”36 These figures can be evaluated better if they are placed in the context
of one another; everyone would prefer a risk of 4/100,000 to a risk of 7/100,000,
and joint evaluation improves evaluability.37 But even when the preference is
clear, both risks seem “small,” and hence it is not at all clear that a proportional
increase in WTP will follow. As noted, most of the studies described above were
“within subjects” rather than “between subjects” and hence evaluability was
promoted by the process of comparison. As suggested by the findings of
Kunreuther and his coauthors, it is likely that in a between-subjects design, WTP
to eliminate a risk of 4/100,000 would be about the same as WTP to eliminate a
risk of 7/100,000, simply because the small difference would not matter when
each risk is taken in isolation.</p>
      <p>Note also that the studies just described involve contingent valuation, not
real-world choices. A significant question is whether and when actual behavior,
in consumer choice or political judgment, shows a general neglect of differences
among low probabilities. In labor markets, for example, are risks of 4/100,000
compensated at about the same level as risks of 7/100,000? This would be a
serious market failure. I am aware of no data on the question.38 But we might
expect that risk markets will reduce the problem of neglect, if only because some
number of people will appreciate the relevant differences, and drive wage and
prices in the appropriate direction. Quite apart from market behavior, some
imaginative studies attempt to overcome probability neglect through visual
aids39 or through providing a great deal of information about comparison
scenarios located on a probability scale.40 Without these aids, it is not so
surprising that differences in low probabilities do not much matter to people. For
most of us, most of the time, the relevant differences—between, say, 1/100,000
and 1/1,000,000—are not pertinent to our decisions, and by experience we are not
well-equipped to take those differences into account.</p>
      <p>My topic here, however, is not the general neglect of differences in low
probabilities, but the particular role of strong emotions in crowding out any
assessment of probability, both low and less low. My central claim is that when
strong emotions are involved, large-scale variations in probabilities will matter
little – even when the variations unquestionably matter when emotions are not
triggered. More generally, probability neglect is dramatically heightened when
emotions are involved. The point applies to hope as well as fear; vivid images of
good outcomes will crowd out consideration of probability too.41 Lotteries are
successful partly for this reason.42 But the subject here is fear rather than hope.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-8">
      <title>B. A Simple Demonstration</title>
      <p>The basic point has received its clearest empirical confirmation in a striking
study of people’s willingness to pay to avoid electric shocks.43 The central
purpose of the study was to test the relevance of probability in “affect rich”
decisions. The experiment of central importance here attempted to see whether
varying the probability of harm would matter more, or less, in settings that
trigger strong emotions than in settings that seem relatively emotion-free. In the
“strong emotion” setting, participants were asked to imagine that they would
participate in an experiment involving some chance of a “short, painful, but not
dangerous electric shock.”44 In the relatively emotion-free setting, participants
were told that the experiment entailed some chance of a $20 penalty. Participants
were asked to say how much they would be willing to pay to avoid participating
in the relevant experiment. Some participants were told that there was a 1%
chance of receiving the bad outcome (either the $20 loss or the electric shock);
others were told that the chance was 99%; and still others were told that the
chance was 100%.</p>
      <p>The central result was that variations in probability affected those facing the
relatively emotion-free injury, the $20 penalty, far more than they affected people
facing the more emotionally evocative outcome of an electric shock. For the cash
penalty, the difference between the median payment for a 1% chance and the
median payment for a 99% chance was predictably large and indeed consistent
with the standard model: $1 to avoid a 1% chance, and $18 to avoid a 99%
chance.45 For the electric shock, by contrast, the difference in probability made
little difference to median willingness to pay: $7 to avoid a 1% chance, and $10 to
avoid a 99% chance!46 Apparently people will pay a significant amount to avoid a
small probability of a hazard that is affectively-laden – and the amount that they
will pay will not vary greatly with changes in probability.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-9">
      <title>C. A More Complex Demonstration</title>
      <p>To investigate the role of probability and emotions in responses to risk, I
conducted an experiment asking about one hundred University of Chicago law
students to describe their maximum willingness to pay to reduce levels of arsenic
in drinking water. The questions had a high degree of realism. They were based
on actual choices confronting the Environmental Protection Agency, involving
cost and benefit information within the ballpark of actual figures used by the
agency itself.47</p>
      <p>Participants were randomly sorted into four groups, representing the four
conditions in the experiment. In the first condition, people were asked to state
their maximum willingness to pay to eliminate a cancer risk of one in 1,000,000.48
In the second condition, people were asked to state their maximum willingness
to pay to eliminate a cancer risk of one in 100,000. In the third condition, people
were asked the same question as in the first, but the cancer was described in
vivid terms, as “very gruesome and intensely painful, as the cancer eats away at
the internal organs of the body.” In the fourth condition, people were asked the
same question as in the second, but the cancer was described in the same terms
as in the third condition. In each condition, participants were asked to check off
their willingness to pay among the following options: $0, $25, $50, $100, $200,
$400, and $800 or more. Notice that the description of the cancer, in the “highly
emotional” conditions, was intended to add little information, consisting simply
45Id.

47See Cass R. Sunstein, The Arithmetic of Arsenic, Georgetown L.J (forthcoming).
48Note that the phrasing of the question ensures that participants would think of the reduction
of the risk to zero, rather than to some fraction of what it was before. People are willing to pay far
more to eliminate risks than to reduce them, even if the savings are identical. See Kahneman and
Tversky, supra note.
of a description of many cancer deaths, though admittedly some participants
might well have thought that these were especially horrific deaths.</p>
      <p>The central hypothesis was that the probability variations would matter far
less in the highly emotional conditions than in the less emotional conditions.
More specifically, it was predicted that differences in probability would make
little or no difference in the highly emotional conditions -- and that such
variations would have real importance in the less emotional conditions. This
prediction was meant to describe a substantial departure from expected utility
theory, which predicts that an ordinary, risk-averse person should be willing to
pay more than 10X to eliminate a risk that is ten times more likely than a risk that
he is willing to pay X to eliminate.49</p>

      <p>In short, the central hypothesis was confirmed. In the highly emotional
condition with a 1/100,000 risk, the median willingness to pay was $100. In the
highly emotional condition with a 1/1,000,000 risk, the median WTP was exactly
the same. In sharp contrast, variations in probability made a significant
difference in the less emotional conditions. For a 1/100,000 risk, the median WTP
was $100. But for a 1/1,000,000 risk, it was merely $25. If we investigate the
means, the central finding is reduced but in the same direction: The difference in
probability had a far greater impact in the less emotional condition (an increase
from $71.25 to $194.44, or about 180%, as opposed to an increase from $132.95 to
$241.30, or about 80%).</p>
      <p>From this experiment, there are several other noteworthy findings. By itself,
the highly emotional description of the cancer had a substantial effect on WTP,
holding probability constant. For the 1/1,000,000 risk, the emotional description
increased median WTP fourfold, from $25 to $100, and nearly doubled the mean,
from $71.25 to $132.95. For the 1/100,000 risk, the median stayed constant ($100),

but the mean was significantly affected, rising from $194.44 to $241.30.50 At the
same time, and basically consistent with other work on probability neglect,
varying the probability had a relatively weak effect on WTP in both conditions.
In the emotional conditions, the tenfold increase in the risk had no effect on the
median and did not even double the mean, which increased merely from $132.95
to $241.30. In the less emotional conditions, that tenfold increase moved the
median from $25 to $100, while moving the mean from $71.25 to $194.44. But
note that in this experiment, the relatively sophisticated participants in the study
showed far more susceptibility to probability information than in the studies,
described above, by Kunreuther et al.; but even so, the susceptibility was far less
than conventional (normative) theory would predict.51</p>
      <p>Indeed, the effect of the more emotional description of the outcome was
essentially the same as the effect of the tenfold increase in its probability. My
principal emphasis, however, is on the fact that when the question was designed
to trigger especially strong emotions, variations in probability had little effect on
WTP, far less of an effect than when the question was phrased in less emotional
terms. This is the kind of probability neglect that I am emphasizing here.</p>

    <sec id="sec-15">
      <title>D. Other Evidence</title>
      <p>Probability neglect, when strong emotions are involved, has been confirmed
in many studies.52 Consider, for example, experiments designed to test levels of
anxiety in anticipation of a painful electric shock of varying intensity, to be
administered after a “countdown period” of a stated length. In these studies, the
stated intensity of the shock had a significant effect on physiological reactions.
But the probability of the shock had no effect. “Evidently, the mere thought of
receiving a shock was enough to arouse subjects, and the precise likelihood of
being shocked had little impact on their arousal level.”53 A related study asked
people to provide their maximum buying prices for risky investments, which
contained different stated probabilities of losses and gains of different
50This relatively small effect might be a product of the fact that the less emotional description
did, after all, involve a cancer death, which is known to produce strong reactions. See Richard
Revesz, Environmental Regulation, Cost-Benefit Analysis, and the Discounting of Human Lives,
99 Col L Rev 941 (1999). A more pronounced effect might be expected if the death was simply
described as a death.</p>
      <p>51See id.</p>

magnitudes.54 Happily for the standard theory, maximum buying prices were
affected by the size of losses and gains and also by probabilities. (Note that for
most people, this experiment did not involve an affect-rich environment.) But –
and this is the key point -- reported feelings of worry were not much affected by
probability levels.55 In this study, then, probability did affect behavior, but it did
not affect emotions. In most of the cases dealt with here, intense emotions drive
out concern with probability, and hence both behavior and worry are affected.</p>
      <p>It should not be surprising, in this light, that visualization or imagery matters
a great deal to people’s reactions to risks.56 When an image of a bad outcome is
easily accessible, people will become greatly concerned about a risk, holding
probability constant.57 Consider the fact that the fact that when people are asked
how much they will pay for flight insurance for losses resulting from
“terrorism,” they will pay more than if they are asked how much they will pay
for flight insurance from all causes.58 The evident explanation for this peculiar
result is that the word “terrorism” evokes vivid images of disaster, thus
crowding out probability judgments. Note also that when people discuss a
lowprobability risk, their concern rises even if the discussion consists mostly of
apparently trustworthy assurances that the likelihood of harm really is
infinitesimal.59 The reason is that the discussion makes it easier to visualize the
risk and hence to fear it.</p>
      <p>Note that this is not a point about the availability heuristic, which leads not to
neglect probability, but answer the question of probability by substituting a hard
question (what is the statistical risk?) with an easy question (do salient examples
readily come to mind?).60 My point here is not that visualization makes an event
seem more probable (though this is also often true), but that visualization makes
the issue of probability less relevant or even irrelevant. In theory, the distinction
should not be obscure. In practice, of course, it will often be hard to know
whether the availability heuristic or probability neglect is driving behavior.</p>
      <p>Emotional reactions to risk, and probability neglect, also account for “alarmist
bias.” 61 When presented with competing accounts of danger, people tend to
move toward the more alarming account.62 In the key study, W. Kip Viscusi
presented subjects with information from two parties, industry and government.
Some subjects were given low-risk information from government, and high-risk
information from industry; other subjects were given high-risk information from
government, and low-risk information from industry. The basic result was that
people treated “the high risk information as being more informative.”63 This
pattern held regardless of whether the low risk information came from industry
or from government. Thus people show “an irrational asymmetry: respondents
overweight the value of a high risk judgment.”64 If the discussion here is correct,
one reason is that the information, whatever its content, makes people focus on
the worst case. There is a lesson for policy here: It might not be helpful to present
people with a wide range of information, containing both assuring and less
assuring accounts.</p>
      <p>The most sensible conclusion is that with respect to risks of injury of harm,
vivid images and concrete pictures of disaster can “crowd out” other kinds of
thoughts, including the crucial thought that the probability of disaster is really
small.65 “If someone is predisposed to be worried, degrees of unlikeliness seem to
provide no comfort, unless one can prove that harm is absolutely impossible,
which itself is not possible.”66 With respect to hope, those who operate gambling
casinos and state lotteries are well-aware of the underlying mechanisms. They
play on people’s emotions in the particular sense that they conjure up palpable
pictures of victory and easy living. With respect to risks, insurance companies
and environmental groups do exactly the same. The point explains “why societal
concerns about hazards such as nuclear power and exposure to extremely small
amounts of toxic chemicals fail to recede in response to information about the
very small probabilities of the feared consequences from such hazards.”67

      <p>65It would be tempting to venture a sociobiological explanation for probability neglect. While
plausible, such an explanation would be highly speculative: We could imagine sociobiological
explanations both for probability neglect and for intense concern with probability. I emphasize

      <title>E. Notes on the Media and on Heterogeneity</title>
      <p>From what has been said thus far, it should be clear that news sources can do
a great deal to trigger fear, simply by offering examples of situations in which the
“worst case” has actually come to fruition. For crime, the point is well
established.68 Media coverage of highly unusual crimes makes people fearful of
risks that they are most unlikely to face.69 When newspapers and magazines are
emphasizing deaths from anthrax or mad cow disease, we should expect a
significant increase in public concern, not only because of the operation of the
availability heuristic, but because people will not naturally make sufficient
adjustments from the standpoint of probability. In fact there is a large warning
here. If newspapers, magazines, and news programs are stressing certain harms
from remote risks, people’s concern is likely to be out of proportion to reality.
Significant changes should therefore be expected over time.70 Across nations, it is
also easy to imagine substantial differences, in social fear, if small initial
differences are magnified as a result of media influences.71</p>
      <p>It is also true that individuals and even societies differ in their susceptibility
to probability neglect. Though experiments have not been conducted on the
precise point, it is clear that some people take probability information into
account even when the context ordinarily engages human emotions. It also
seems clear that some people neglect probability information much of the time,
focusing insistently on the worst case (or for that matter the best). The arsenic
experiment, mentioned above, displays a great deal of individual heterogeneity
in taking account of probability.72 Those who are peculiarly insensitive to
probability information are likely to do poorly in many domains, including
economic markets; those who are unusually attentive to that information are
likely to do well for just that reason. Perhaps there are demographic differences
here; it is well-known that some groups are less concerned about most risks than
are others,73 and that the difference in concern may stem, in part, from the fact
that some groups are less likely to neglect probability.</p>
      <p>On the social level, institutions can make a great deal of difference in
decreasing or increasing susceptibility to probability/neglect. Highly responsive

democratic institutions, automatically translating public fear into law, will
neglect probabilities when emotions are running high. A more deliberative
democracy would attempt to create institutions that have a degree of immunity
from short-turn public alarm.74 Cost-benefit analysis might, for example, serve as
a check on regulation that would accomplish little good, or less good than is
justified by the facts.75 The point raises the general question of the relationship
between probability neglect and law.</p>
      <p>IV. Law</p>
      <p>If emotionally charged outcomes produce intense reactions even though they
are highly unlikely to occur, how might our understanding of law be improved?
To answer this question, it is important to separate law’s prescriptive, positive,
and normative tasks.76 With prescriptive analysis, we seek to find effective ways
to achieve shared goals; positive analysis attempts to explain why law takes the
form that it does; normative analysis explores what law should do. I take these
up in sequence.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-17">
      <title>A. Prescriptions: Obtaining Agreed-Upon Goals</title>
      <p>Suppose that government is seeking to lead people to achieve goals on which
there is a social consensus. Government might, for example, want to encourage
people to avoid large risks and to worry less over small risks. If so, it would do
well to attempt not to provide information about probabilities, but to appeal to
people’s emotions and to attend to the worst case. With respect to the risks on
which it wants people to focus, government should use vivid images of alarming
scenarios. For cigarette smoking, abuse of alcohol, reckless driving, and abuse of
drugs, this is exactly what government occasionally attempts to do. It should be
no surprise that some of the most effective efforts to control cigarette smoking
appeal to people’s emotions, by making them feel that if they smoke, they will be
dupes of the tobacco companies or imposing harms on innocent third parties—
and they do so especially by providing vivid images of illness or even death.77</p>
      <p>Because of probability neglect, it should not be terribly difficult to trigger
public fear (terrorism is effective in part for exactly that reason). But there are
serious ethical issues here. Government ought to treat its citizens with respect78;
it should not treat them as objects to be channeled in government’s preferred
directions. Perhaps government ought not to manipulate or to trick them, by
taking advantage of their limitations in thinking about risk. A skeptic might
think that the use of worst-case scenarios, or dramatic images of harm, consists of
unacceptable manipulation. While I cannot fully resolve the issue here, the
charge seems to me unwarranted. So long as the government is democratically
accountable, and attempting to discourage people from running genuinely
serious risks, there should be no objection in principle. Those who want people
to run risks, for economic or other purposes, use similar techniques,79 and
government should probably be permitted to meet fire with fire. Democratic
accountability is important because it is a check on manipulative behavior; if
government is manipulating people in an objectionable way, citizens are likely to
rebel. Of course the issue is not simple. In the context of state lotteries, state
governments use dramatic images of “easy street” in order to lead people to
spend money for tickets whose actuarial value is effectively zero, and this
strategy, exploiting probability neglect in the domain of hope, does raise ethical
issues.80 My suggestion is only that if government wants people not to run risks,
it is likely to do well if it appeals to their emotions.</p>
      <p>There is also a striking asymmetry between increasing fear and decreasing it.
If people are now alarmed about a low-probability hazard, is there anything that
government can do to provide assurance and to dampen concern? This is an
unanswered question. The only clear point is that if government is unlikely to be
successful if it simply emphasizes the low probability that the risk will occur.
There appears to be no evidence that any particular strategy will succeed. But the
best approach seems to be simple: change the subject. We have seen that
discussions of low-probability risks tend to heighten public concern, even if
those discussions consist largely of reassurance. Perhaps the most effective way
of reducing fear of a low-probability risk is simply to discuss something else and
to let time do the rest. Of course media attention can undermine this approach.</p>
      <p>78See the discussion of the publicity condition in John Rawls, A Theory of Justice (1971), a
condition that raises some questions about any governmental effort to enlist probability neglect
in its preferred directions.</p>

      </p>
      <p>As I have suggested, institutional safeguards might well be the best way of
ensuring against the harmful consequences of probability neglect. The Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs, within the Office of Management and
Budget, monitors agency action to ensure that it is directed against significant
problems.81 A general requirement of cost-benefit balancing should provide a
check on regulations that cannot be grounded in objective fact.82 If government
wants to protect itself against the pattern of “paranoia and neglect” 83 that now
characterizes regulatory policy, analytic requirements and institutional checks
will provide a start.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-18">
      <title>B. Positive Analysis: What Drives the Demand For Law?</title>
      <p>If probability neglect characterizes individual judgment under certain
circumstances, might government and law be neglecting probability under those
same circumstances? There is good reason for an affirmative answer. In the
domain of risk regulation as elsewhere, public officials are highly responsive to
the public demand for law. If people insist on government protection against
risk, government is likely to provide that protection. If people show unusually
strong reactions to low-probability catastrophes, government is likely to act
accordingly. Of course interest groups are involved as well. When their
selfinterest is at stake, we should expect them to exploit people’s emotions, in
particular by stressing the worst case. In the environmental area, for example,
there has been an intense debate about whether the National Environmental
Policy Act requires agencies to discuss the worst-case scenario in environmental
impact statements.84 Environmental groups sought to ensure discussion of that
scenario.85 They did so in part to stimulate public concern, with the knowledge
that the worst case might well have a great deal of salience, even if it is highly
unlikely. For its part, the government originally required discussion of the worst
case, but changed in its mind, with the apparent understanding that people are
too likely to overreact. Hence the current approach, upheld by the Supreme
Court,86 requires consideration of low-probability events, but only if they are not
entirely remote and speculative.</p>
      <p>A good deal of legislation and regulation can be explained partly by reference
to probability neglect when emotions are running high. In this space, I cannot
demonstrate the point rigorously. But consider a few examples87:
! In the aftermath of the adverse health effects allegedly caused by abandoned
hazardous waste in Love Canal, the government responded with an
aggressive program for cleaning up abandoned hazardous waste cites,
without examining the probability that illness would actually occur. In fact
little was accomplished by early efforts to assure people of the low probability
of harm.88 When the local health department publicized controlled studies
showing little evidence of adverse effects, the publicity did not dampen
concern, because the numbers “had no meaning.”89 In fact the numbers
seemed to aggravate fear, insofar as they discussed the problem at all: “One
woman, divorced and with three sick children, looked at the piece of paper
with numbers and started crying hysterically: ‘No wonder my children are
sick. Am I doing to die? What’s going to happen to my children?’”90 Questions
of this sort contributed to the enactment of new legislation to control
abandoned hazardous waste sites, legislation that did not embody careful
consideration of the probability of significant health or environmental
benefits.91 Even now, the government does not take much account of the
probability of significant harm in making clean-up decisions.92
! During a highly publicized campaign designed to show a connection between
Alar, a pesticide, and cancer in children, the public demand for action was not
much affected by the EPA’s cautionary notes about the low probability of
getting that disease.93

! In the fall of 2001, vivid images of shark attacks created a public outcry about
new risks for ocean swimmers.94 Consider the fact that a NEXIS search found
no fewer than 940 references to shark attacks between August 4, 2001, and
September 4, 2001,95 with 130 references to "the summer of the shark."96 This
was so notwithstanding the exceedingly low probability of a shark attack, and
the absence of any reliable evidence of an increase in shark attacks in the
summer of 2001.97 Predictably, there was considerable discussion of new
legislation to control the problem,98 and eventually such legislation was
enacted.99 Public fear seemed relatively impervious to the fact that the
underlying risk was tiny.
! Jury behavior is not likely to be greatly affected by assurance that the risk was
unlikely to come to fruition, even if the issue of probability is legally
relevant.100 In cases involving low-probability risks of emotionally gripping
harms, it should be relatively easy to convince jurors to offer high damage
awards. Litigators therefore do well to try to engage jurors’ emotions by
pointing to the worst case. There is a strong implication here for the law of
negligence: Even if the law asks the jury to balance the benefits of the
defendant’s action against the costs, the jury is likely to disregard the issue of
probability if its attention is focused on an outcome that triggers strong
emotions. Along the same lines, an understanding of probability neglect helps
explain the finding, in both experimental and real-world settings, that juries
do not respond favorably to a demonstration that the defendant performed a
cost-benefit analysis before proceeding, even if the analysis places a high value
on human life.101 The reason is that jurors will be focusing on the badness of
the outcome, not the low (ex ante) probability that it would have occurred.
! The anthrax scare of October, 2001 was based on exceedingly few incidents.</p>
      <p>Only four people died of the infection; only about a dozen others fell ill. The
probability of being infected was exceedingly low. Nonetheless, fear
proliferated, with people focusing their attention on the outcome rather than
the low probability of the harm. The government responded accordingly,
investing massive resources in ensuring against anthrax infections. Private
institutions reacted the same way, asking people to take extraordinary care in
opening the mail even though the statistical risks were tiny (see appendix for
an example). To say this is not to suggest that extensive precautions were
unjustified in this case. Private and public institutions faced an unknown
probability of a major health problem, and it was appropriate to respond. My
point is that public fear was disproportionate to its cause, and that the level of
response was disproportionate too.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-19">
      <title>C. Normative Issues: Capitulating to Fear?</title>
      <p>For law, the hardest questions might well be normative ones: How should
law and government respond to a quasi-rational public panic, based on an
intense emotional reaction to a low-probability risk? Let us distinguish two
possible positions. The technocrat would want to ignore public irrationality, and
to respond to risks if and to the extent that they are real. The populist would
want to respond to public concerns, simply because they are public concerns. In
my view, both positions are far too simple, though the populist is closer to the
mark.</p>
      <p>Suppose that people are greatly concerned about a risk that has a small or
even miniscule probability of occurring -- shark attacks, or anthrax in the mail, or
terrorism on airplanes. If government is confident that it knows the facts, and if
people are far more concerned than the facts warrant, should the government
101See W. Kip Viscusi, Corporate Risk Analysis: A Reckless Act?, 52 Stan. L. Rev. 547 (2000).
respond, via regulation, to their concerns? Or should it ignore them, on the
ground that the concerns are irrational? Consider the individual analogy first.
Even if people’s fear is itself irrational, it might well be rational for them to take
account of that fear in their behavior. If I am afraid to fly, I might decline to do
so, on the ground that my fear will make the experience quite dreadful (not only
while flying but in anticipating it). At the same time, the fear itself might be
irrational, and I might even recognize that fact. If the fear exists, but if I cannot
eliminate it, the most rational decision might be not to fly. So too at the social
level. Suppose, for example, that people are afraid of arsenic in drinking water,
and that they demand steps to provide assurance that arsenic levels will not be
hazardous. Suppose too that the risks from existing levels of arsenic are
infinitesimal. Is it so clear that government should refuse to do what people want
it to do? The fear is by hypothesis real. If people are scared that their drinking
water is “not safe,” they are, simply for that reason, experiencing a significant
loss. In many domains, widespread fear helps produce an array of additional
problems. It may, for example, make people reluctant to engage in certain
activities, such as flying on airplanes or eating certain foods. The resulting costs
can be extremely high.102 Why shouldn’t government attempt to reduce fear, just
as it attempts to produce other gains to people’s well-being?</p>
      <p>
        The simplest answer here is that if government is able to inform and educate
people, it should do that instead. It should not waste resources on steps that will
do nothing other than to reduce fear. But the simplest answer is too pat. Whether
information and education will work is an empirical question on which we lack
definitive evidence. If these do not work, government should respond, just as
individuals do, to fears that are quasi-rational, but real and by hypothesis
difficult to eradicate. Suppose, for example, that government could cheaply
undertake a procedure that would reduce a tiny risk to zero – and equally
important, be seen to reduce the relevant risk to zero. It seems clear that
government should take this step, which may be more effective, and less
expensive, than education and information. Recall that fear is a real social cost,
and it is likely to lead to other social costs.103 If, for example, people are afraid to
102The mad cow disease scare is an example, producing many millions of dollars in losses.
103My point here is not that all subjective perceptions and losses should be counted in law.
Many people, for example, like to discriminate on the basis of race and sex, and they suffer a
genuine loss, for which they might be willing to pay, as a result of the legal prohibition on
discrimination. I do not believe that their loss should be counted, though I cannot defend the
point here. See Matthew Adler and Eric Posner, Implementing Cost-Benefit Analysis when
Preferences Are Distorted, in Cost-Benefit Analysis 269
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Matthew Adler and Eric Posner eds.

        , for a helpful discussion. Although the fear discussed in the text is not fully rational, it
fly, the economy will suffer in multiple ways; so too if people are afraid to send
or to receive mail. The reduction of even baseless fear is a social good.
      </p>
      <p>Even if it is clear that government should respond, many questions remain.
How and how much should government respond? The answer must depend in
large part on the extent of the fear and the cost of the response. If people are
extremely fearful, a substantial response is of course easier to justify; if the cost of
response is very high, a refusal to respond might well make sense. With this
point, the analysis of appropriate action becomes similar to the analysis in many
other settings. We need to know how much good, and how much harm, would
be done by the action in question. A special difficulty here consists in the
problem of quantifying and monetizing fear and its consequences, a problem
that has yet to be seriously engaged in the relevant literature.104</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-20">
      <title>V. What’s an Emotion?</title>
      <p>Thus far I have been writing as if there is a clear distinction between
cognition and emotion. But actually the distinction is complex and contested.105
In the domain of risks, and most other places, emotional reactions are usually
based on thinking; they are hardly cognition-free. When a negative emotion is
associated with a certain risk – pesticides or nuclear power, for example –
cognition is playing a central role. In fact there are large debates about whether
an emotion is a form of thought, or whether thoughts are necessary and
sufficient conditions for emotions, or whether emotions is a sense precede or
outrun cognition.106 But it is clear that no simple line can be drawn between
emotions and cognition in most social domains. Whatever they are, emotions can
lead us astray; but the same is true for math, biology, and animal experiments.</p>
      <p>There are several ways to make progress here. Some research suggests that
the brain has special sectors for emotions, and that some types of emotions,
including some fear-type reactions (my emphasis here), can be triggered before
the more cognitive sectors become involved at all.107 Those who hear sudden,
unexplained noises are fearful before they are able to identify the source of the
cannot be said to be invidious or vicious, and hence cannot be “impeached” in the same way as
discriminatory preferences.</p>

noise.108 People who have been given intravenous injections of procaine, which
stimulates the amygdala, report panic sensations.109 In research with human
beings, electrical stimulation of the amygdala leads to reported feelings of fear
and foreboding, even without any reason for these things, leading people to say,
for example, that they feel as if someone were chasing them.110 It is not true,
however, that fear in human beings is generally pre-cognitive or noncognitive,
and even if it is in some cases, it is not clear that noncognitive fear would be
triggered by most of the risks faced in everyday human lives.</p>
      <p>For purposes of the analysis here, it is not necessary to say anything
especially controversial about the nature of the emotion of fear. I do think that
when that emotion is involved, some kind of arousal is necessary; we would not
say that someone is really afraid without some kind of arousal.111 But if people
have a negative reaction to the prospect of electric shocks, or flying, or anthrax,
thinking is emphatically involved. The only suggestion is that when emotions are
intense, calculation is less likely to occur, or at least that form of calculation that
involves assessment of risks in terms of not only the badness but also the
probability of the outcome. That point is sufficient for my arguments here.</p>

      <title>VI. Conclusion</title>
      <p>In this Essay, my central claim has been that the probability of harm will be
neglected when people’s emotions are activated, especially if people are thinking
about the worst-case scenario. If that scenario is vivid and easy to visualize,
large-scale changes in thought and behavior are to be expected. The point helps
explain public overreaction to highly publicized, low-probability risks, including
those posed by abandoned hazardous waste dumps and anthrax. Because
rational people focus on the probability as well as the severity of harm,
probability neglect is a form of quasi-rationality.</p>
      <p>It follows that if a private or public actor is seeking to produce public
attention to a neglected risk, it is best to provide vivid, even visual images of the

worst that might happen. It also follows that government regulation, affected as
it is by the public demand for law, will neglect probability too. At first glance, the
government should not respond if the public is demanding attention to a
statistically miniscule risk, and doing so simply because people are visualizing
the worst that can happen. The best response is information and education. But
public fear is itself a concern and sometimes a quite serious one. If that fear
cannot be alleviated without risk reduction, then government should engage in
risk reduction, at least if the relevant steps are justified by an assessment of costs
and benefits.112
112I have not said anything here about the difficult issue of how to monetize public fear.</p>

      <title>Appendix B</title>
      <p>The following memorandum consists of a memorandum sent to a university
community in the midst of the anthrax threat. I include it here not because it is
idiosyncratic, but because it captures a kind of “best practices” approach at the
time. Note the breadth of the concern, calling on people to wear latex gloves
while opening mail and including in the category of “suspicious mail” anything
from “someone unfamiliar to you” (a large percentage of the mail received by
most people), and advising those in receipt of such mail to notify the police, to
isolate the mail, and to leave the area.</p>
      <p>Re:</p>
      <p>Updated Procedures for Handling Mail Suspected of Anthrax Contamination</p>
      <p>In light of recent events in which the United States mail was used to distribute anthrax, we recommend
that you follow the up-dated guidelines below when handling mail.</p>
      <p>General Mail Handling
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•</p>
      <p>Be observant for suspicious envelopes or packages.</p>
      <p>Open all mail with a letter opener or method that is least likely to disturb contents.</p>
      <p>Open packages/envelopes with a minimum amount of movement.</p>
      <p>Do not blow into envelopes.</p>
      <p>Do not shake or pour out contents.</p>
      <p>Keep hands away from nose, and mouth while opening mail.</p>
      <p>Wash hands after handling mail.</p>
      <p>We also recommend that you wear latex gloves when opening mail.</p>
      <p>(If you are allergic to latex, hypoallergenic gloves are available).</p>
      <p>What constitutes suspicious mail or parcels?</p>
      <p>The mail or parcel is considered suspicious when it is/has:
a powdery substance on the outside;
excessive postage, tape, a handwritten or poorly typed address, incorrect titles, or titles with no
names, or misspelling of common words;
unexpected or from someone unfamiliar to you;
from a foreign country and is not expected;
addressed to someone no longer with the organization or otherwise outdated;
no return address, or has one that cannot be verified as legitimate;
an unusual weight, given its size, or is lopsided or oddly shaped;
marked with restrictive language, such as “Personal “ or “Confidential”;
protruding wires, strange odors or stains;
a postmark that does not match the return address.</p>
      <p>What should I do if I receive suspicious mail or a suspicious parcel?</p>
      <p>Do not handle the mail or parcel.</p>
      <p>Notify your supervisor immediately.</p>
      <p>Make sure that the suspicious mail or parcel remains isolated.</p>
      <p>Leave the area of the suspicious mail or parcel and do not let others into the area until appropriate
authorities have indicated that it is safe to do so.</p>
      <p>Ensure that each person who touched the suspicious mail or parcel washes his or her hands with
soap and water.</p>
      <p>List all persons who have touched the suspicious mail or parcel.</p>
