Availability  Cascades
and Risk Regulation

Timur Kuran* and Cass R. Sunstein**

An  availability cascade is  a  self-reinforcing process of collective  belief
formation by  which an expressed perception triggers a chain reaction that gives
the perception increasing plausibility through  its rising availability in public
discourse. The  driving mechanism involves a combination of informational and
reputational motives:  Individuals endorse  the perception partly by  learning
from  the apparent beliefs  of others and partly by  distorting their public re-
sponses in the interest of maintaining social acceptance. Availability entrepre-
neurs-activists who manipulate the content of public discourse-strive to trig-
ger availability cascades likely  to  advance their agendas.  Their availability
campaigns may yield social benefits,  but sometimes  they  bring harm, which
suggests a  need for safeguards.  Focusing on  the role of mass pressures in the
regulation of risks associated with production, consumption, and the  environ-
ment, Professors Timur Kuran and Cass R.  Sunstein analyze  availability cas-
cades and suggest reforms to alleviate their potential hazards.  Their proposals
include new  governmental structures designed to give  civil servants better in-
sulation against mass demands for regulatory change and an easily accessible
scientific database to reduce people's dependence on popular (mis)perceptions.

A VAILABILITY  CASCADES

INTRODUCTION

The  purpose  of  this  article  is  to  identify  a  set  of  interlinked  social
mechanisms  that  have  important,  sometimes  desirable,  but  at  other  times
harmful  effects  on  risk  regulation.  The  harmful  effects  range  from
to  mass  anxiety  about  foods  with  no
inconsistent  health  regulations 
scientifically  confirmed  health  hazards.  The  underlying  mechanisms  help
legislators,
the  production  of  law 
shape 
administrative  agencies,  and courts.

their  effects  on 

through 

The  mechanisms  presented  below  are  mediated  by  the  availability heu-
ristic, a  pervasive  mental  shortcut  whereby  the  perceived  likelihood  of any
given  event  is  tied to  the  ease  with  which  its  occurrence  can  be  brought to
mind.  Cognitive psychologists  consider  the  availability heuristic  to  be a key
determinant of individual judgment and perception.  They  have demonstrated
that the probability  assessments  we make as individuals  are  frequently  based
on  the  ease  with  which  we  can  think  of relevant  examples.'  Our  principal
claim  here is  that this heuristic  interacts  with identifiable  social  mechanisms
to  generate  availability cascades-social cascades,  or  simply  cascades,
through  which  expressed  perceptions  trigger  chains  of individual  responses
that make  these perceptions  appear increasingly plausible  through their rising
availability  in  public  discourse.  Availability  cascades  may  be  accompanied
by  counter-mechanisms  that  keep  perceptions  consistent  with  the  relevant
facts.  Under certain  circumstances,  however,  they generate  persistent social
availability errors-widespread  mistaken  beliefs  grounded  in  interactions
between  the  availability  heuristic  and  the  social  mechanisms  we  describe.2
The  resulting  mass  delusions  may  last  indefinitely,  and  they  may  produce
wasteful or even detrimental  laws  and policies.

An  availability  cascade  subsumes  two  of the  special  cascades  that have
recently  received  considerable  attention  in  the  social  sciences,  though not in
informational  cascades  and  reputational  cascades.'  An  informational
law:

Slovic  & Amos  Tversky  eds.,  1982)  (describing  the  availability  heuristic)  [hereinafter  JUDGMENT

cascade  occurs when  people with  incomplete  personal  information  on a par-
ticular  matter base  their own beliefs  on the  apparent beliefs  of others.  To be
more  specific,  suppose  that the  words  and  deeds  of certain  individuals  give
the impression  that they accept a particular  belief.  In response  to their com-
munications,  other  individuals,  who  lack  reliable  information,  may  accept
that belief simply by virtue  of its acceptance  by  others.  As long as members
of the relevant  group  are heterogeneous  along  one  or more  dimensions  (e.g.,
initial  personal  information,  willingness  to  rely  on  others  for  information,
timing  of social  contacts),  the  transformation  of the  distribution  of beliefs
can  take  the form  of a  cascade,  known  also as  a bandwagon  or  snowballing
process.4  Not  every member  of a society  experiencing  an  informational  cas-
cade  need  be  influenced;  those  with  considerable  private  information  may
remain unswayed.  Under the right conditions, however, many or most of the
society's members, potentially even all,  will end up with essentially identical
beliefs,  which may  well be fanciful.

Insofar as  society  is  socially  fragmented,  it may  exhibit local informa-
tional cascades.  A  local  informational  cascade  is  one  limited,  for example,
to  a  geographical  area,  a  demographic  subgroup,  or  a  core  of activists  who
share  a political  objective.  Local  informational  cascades  are  quite  common
and, as we shall  see, potentially quite important.

Like  an  informational  cascade,  a reputational  cascade  is  driven by inter-
dependencies  among individual  choices.  It differs,  however, in the underly-
ing  personal  motivations.  In  the  case  of a reputational  cascade,  individuals
do  not  subject themselves  to  social  influences  because  others  may  be  more
knowledgeable.  Rather, the  motivation  is simply to earn social  approval  and
avoid disapproval.  In seeking to  achieve their reputational  objectives,  people
take  to speaking  and  acting  as  if they  share,  or  at  least  do not reject,  what

they view as the  dominant belief.  Everyone  has  had the experience  of modi-
fying public statements or  actions  in order to win praise  or avoid censure.  If
a particular perception  of an event  somehow  appears to have become  the so-
cial  norm, people  seeking  to build or protect their  reputations will  begin  en-
dorsing it through  their words  and  deeds, regardless  of their  actual  thoughts.
As  in the  informational  case,  the  outcome  may  be  the  cleansing  of deviant
perceptions,  arguments,  and actions  from  public  discourse.  And just as  in-
formational  cascades  may be limited in their reach, there may  exist local re-
putational cascades-self-reinforcing  processes  that reshape  the  public  pro-
nouncements  of particular  subgroups  without  affecting  those  of the  broader
group.

Reputational  and informational  cascades  are not mutually exclusive.  Or-
dinarily,  they  exhibit  interactions  and  even  feed  on  one  another.5  The  re-
sulting composite  process,  which is generally  triggered by a  salient event,  is
what we are calling an availability cascade.6

Social  agents  who understand  the dynamics  of availability  cascades  and
seek to  exploit their  insights  may be  characterized  as  availability entrepre-
neurs.  Located anywhere  in the social  system, including the government, the
media,  nonprofit  organizations,  the  business  sector,  and  even  households,
these entrepreneurs  attempt to trigger  availability  cascades  likely to advance
their  own  agendas. 7  They  do  so  by  fixing  people's  attention  on  specific
problems,  interpreting  phenomena  in particular ways, and  attempting to raise
the salience  of certain  information.  For  example,  availability  entrepreneurs
acting  on behalf of corporations  focus  on  cases  of strikingly  large  punitive
damages  awards  as a  means of building  support for tort reform.  Likewise,
environmental  organizations  draw attention  to apparent  disasters  (e.g.,  Love

CONSEQUENCES  OF  PREFERENCE  FALSIFICATION  157-95,  289-309  (1995)  (describing  the  interac-
tions between public discourse and private thought).

6.  The two constituent  elements of an availability  cascade  do  not exhaust  the observed  social
cascades.  Another broad category consists of networking cascades, which are driven by increasing
returns  to network size.  The  utility  people derive  from  e-mail rises  with the number  of people  on
the  Internet,  which  means  that  the  Internet's  expansion,  once  the  process  is  under  way,  is  self-
reinforcing.  For insights  into networking  cascades,  see W.  BRIAN  ARTHUR,  INCREASING  RETURNS
AND PATH DEPENDENCE  IN THE ECONOMY (1994);  Paul  A. David,  The Hero and the Herd in Tech-
nological History: Reflections on Thomas  Edison and the Battle of the  Systems,  in FAVORITES  OF
FORTUNE:  TECHNOLOGY,  GROWTH,  AND  ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT  SINCE  THE  INDUSTRIAL
REVOLUTION  72  (Patrice  Higonnet,  David S.  Landes  & Henry Rosovsky  eds.,  1991);  and  Thomas
C. Schelling, Dynamic Models of Segregation, I J. MATHEMATICAL  SOC.  143  (1971).  Networking
effects do not enter our analysis here.

justified.

Canal,  Chernobyl,  Three  Mile  Island) to  support  their calls  for tighter  regu-
lation.9

Such  availability campaigns often  produce  social  benefits  by  overcom-
ing public  torpor  and  fueling debates  on long-festering  though  rarely  articu-
lated problems.  These  desirable  effects  can  arise  in  domains  as  diverse  as
economic regulation,  identity politics,  and social  customs.  At the  same  time,
availability  campaigns  sometimes  do  great  harm  by  producing  widespread
availability  errors.10  This  danger  points  to  the  need  for  institutional  safe-
guards  to  ensure better priority-setting and fuller use of scientific knowledge.
Proper  safeguards,  which need  not entail  either  "more"  regulation  or "less"
regulation,  can save both lives and dollars.

Offering  recent  examples  of availability  cascades  that  have  resulted  in
socially  harmful  regulatory responses,  we  shall propose  institutional  reforms
to  insulate  the  government  and  the  legal  system  against  the  political  pres-
sures  generated  by harmful  cascades.  Insofar  as  the  reforms  turn  out to  be
effective,  they  would  ensure  that  when  government  responds  to  political
pressures, it does  so  because  the  underlying problems  are  serious.  Although
our proposals  are  developed  with  special  reference  to  the  tripartite  govern-
mental  system  of the  United  States,  with  minor  modifications  they  can  be
applied  to  any  democratic  system.  Our  analytical  framework  and  policy
conclusions  carry  major implications  for both populist and  deliberative  con-
ceptions  of democracy.  A central  theme in  contemporary  debates  on democ-
racy  is that political judgments  should reflect  much more than  a technocratic
exercise;  these judgments  should  be based  on the  facts,  to  be sure,  but also
on people's  reflective  values,  including  their  tolerance  for  uncertainty.  The
analysis  below  is  followed  by  concrete  proposals  on  how  these  objectives
can be advanced.

All  of our major illustrations  involve  availability  cascades  pertaining  to
the regulation  of risks,"  a  topic  especially  well-suited  to  exploring  interac-
tions between  democracy  and law.  We hasten  to point out, however, that the
general  framework  can be  applied to  a  wide  variety  of other  areas.  Among
the diverse  social  transformations  that exhibit  striking  examples of availabil-
ity  cascades  are  the rise  and  decline  of McCarthyism;  the  struggle  for black
civil  rights;  the  student rebellions  of the  1960s;  the  spread  of affirmative  ac-
tion  and the recent  explosion  of public  opposition to  it;  the rise of feminism,
the  anti-tax  movement,  and  the  religious  right;  ongoing  campaigns  against
pornography,  hate  speech,  smoking,  health  maintenance  organizations,  and

11.  We  understand  "risk"  to refer  to a  probability of mortality  or morbidity in  human  beings
or animals.  As  legend has  it, Gertrude  Stein gave  a more engaging definition.  Faced with  William
James'  exam question,  "What is risk?" she offered a concise  answer:  "This  is."

the burning  of black churches;  the  spread  of ethnic  and religious  separatism
across  the  world;  the  persistence  and sudden  fall  of communism;  the  global
turn toward market-friendly  government policies;  campaigns  for safe sex;  the
enforcement  of Megan's  Law,  designed  to inform  a community when  a con-
victed  sex  offender  moves  in;  and  finally,  the  emergence  of the  Federalist
Society  at American  law schools. 12

Legal scholars  are now devoting considerable  attention to  the virtues  and
vices  of rational  actor models,  including those  of models  that accommodate
social  influences. 13  It will therefore be useful  to  specify  at this juncture how
our approach  bears  on various  claims  in the  existing  literature  that,  for all its
diversity,  falls  under the  rubric  of "rational  choice."  There  is  nothing  irra-
tional  about  participating  in  an  informational  cascade.  Often  people  have
little  information  about  the  magnitude  of a risk  or  the  seriousness  of  an  al-
leged  social problem.  They stand  to gain from  tuning into, and letting  them-
selves  be  guided  by, the  signals  of others.  Although informational  cascades
may cause  false  beliefs  to  spread  and  strengthen,  they  are  nonetheless  con-
sistent  with  individual  rationality  as  the  concept  is  generally  understood.
Indeed, models of this phenomenon  are  expressly based  on the  rational  actor
framework.  They treat  individuals  as utility maximizers  who weigh  all their
options.14  Nor  is there  anything irrational  about being concerned  with one's
reputation  or  anything rational  about being unconcerned.  To  lack an  interest
in  protecting  and  improving  one's  reputation  is not  an  indicator  of rational-
ity; rather, it is a  mark of sociopathy.  Models  of reputational  cascades  depart
from the conventional  economic  model merely by recognizing that reputation
is an ingredient of individual  utility  functions.

The  only  element  of our  analysis  that  challenges  the  conventional  ra-
tional  actor model  is  the role we attribute  to the  availability  heuristic.  Those
who have  investigated this  heuristic tend  to  consider it a cognitive  limitation
or,  to  use  alternative  terminology,  an  indicator  of quasi-rationality.  They

stress  that  the  heuristic  confirms  the  difficulties  people  face  in  processing
information. 15  But  using  the  availability  heuristic  may  be  entirely rational
from  the  standpoint  of an  imperfectly  informed  real agent.  After  all,  the
cognitive  powers  of a  real  agent,  unlike those  of the  fictitious agents  in con-
ventional models,  are limited.  People who seek to minimize search  and deci-
sion costs,  and who look for reliable  information  about a particular risk, may
do  best  to  form  their  assessments  according  to  what  incidents  come  most
readily  to  mind.  It is  true,  however,  that the  availability  heuristic  can  pro-
duce  systematic and persistent misperceptions. 
It  also  appears  that people
resort to  this heuristic  more than they would  if they were perfectly  rational. 6
But we  do not need to  pursue  these  points  here.  None  of our  analysis  rides
on the precise  definition of what it means to be rational.  What  does matter  is
that we  consider  a  society composed  of boundedly rational  individuals  who
benefit immensely  from using cognitive rules of thumb.

This  article  contributes  to  the  nascent  field  of  behavioral  analysis  of
law,17 which  stresses the  significance  of both cognitive  limitations and  social
influences.  Steering  clear  of the  most vexing  controversies  about  the extent
to  which  people  are  "rational,"  we  explore  how  interactions  between  peo-
ple's reliance on the availability heuristic  and identifiable  social mechanisms
direct the  transformation  of laws and policies.  The  consequences  can be  so-
cially  disastrous,  so  we proceed to  explore  institutional  reforms  that may  di-
minish the potential  hazards.

Part I begins  with an  account of an  availability cascade  that has  imposed
immense  costs  on Americans,  and it continues  with  shorter  accounts  of two
additional cases.  Forming  the  article;s  theoretical  core, Parts  II  and  HI  pro-
vide  a  conceptual  framework  for  studying  availability  cascades  and  identi-
fying their social  and legal  consequences.  Part IV draws implications for the
regulation  of risks within  a democratic  social  order.  Addressing  the  appro-
priate  role  of science,  it also points  to  the  possible  disadvantages  of basing
laws  and  policies  solely  or mechanically  on publicly  expressed  judgments.
This  Part  also  connects  availability  cascades  with  democratic  aspirations,
including  the  ideal  of deliberative  democracy.  Our concrete  policy  sugges-
tions  are  in  Part  V,  which  includes  proposals  to  improve  the  workings  of
Congress,  the  courts,  and  the  executive  branch.  Offering  institutional  de-

fenses  of peer  review  and  cost-benefit  analysis,  this  Part  also  relates  our
theoretical  argument to  the  matter  of product disparagement  laws,  which re-
ceived  substantial  media  coverage  through  a  suit brought by beef producers
against  talk-show  host  Oprah  Winfrey.  Finally,  Part  VI  goes  beyond  the
subject  of risk  regulation,  touching  on  the  broader  social  significance  of
availability cascades.

I.  COSTLY AVAILABILITY  ERRORS

We now present three  examples  of availability  errors, which  will  form  a
background  for  the  subsequent  analysis.  The  first,  which  is  the  most  de-
tailed,  will  be  particularly  valuable  in  demonstrating  the  significance  of
availability  cascades,  including their potentially  lasting  influence  on law  and
policy.',

A.  Love Canal

Between  1942  and  1953,  the  Hooker  Chemical  Company  filled  Love
Canal,  an  abandoned  waterway  that  feeds  into  the  Niagara  River  in  New
York  State, with  more than 21,000  tons  of chemical  waste. 19  It then covered
the waste  with dirt  and sold  Love  Canal  to  the Niagara  Falls  Board  of Edu-
cation  for  $1.20  The  local  government  developed  the  area,  turning  it into  a
neighborhood  of more  than  200  houses.21  The neighborhood  was  settled  in
1957,  and the  site of the  old canal,  which many of the new homes bordered,
became  a school  and a playground.

After  several  years  of unusually  heavy  precipitation,  the  canal  over-
flowed  its banks  in  1976.22  In that year a  commission responsible  for moni-
toring  the  Great  Lakes  detected  the  insecticide  Mirex  in  Lake  Ontario  fish,
and  the  New  York  Department  of  Environmental  Conservation  identified
Love  Canal  as  a  major  source.  When  the  local  press  began  reporting  that
area residents  were worried  about the  health effects  of Love Canal,  frighten-

ing tales spread  quickly: 23  children being burnt,  omnipresent  odors inducing
nausea, undrinkable  water,  and black  sludge  everywhere.24  According to the
front-page  stories,  residents feared  that the buried  chemicals  had resurfaced,
making their neighborhood  unlivable.

At  this  stage,  neither  the  state  government  nor  the  federal  government
attempted  to  reassure the residents  about their neighborhood's  safety,  proba-
bly for fear  that such  efforts  would  only  engender  distrust  and  because they
thought  the  anxieties  would  dissipate  on  their  own.  Taking  the  cautious
route,  government  officials  ordered  a  series  of tests. 25  These  detected  low
levels  of carcinogens  in basements  near  the  dump  site,  and in early  1978  the
Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  confirmed  the  findings.  The  EPA
also reported,  however, that the  observed  toxicity was  not at all threatening;
the water  was  safe  to drink,  and  Lake  Ontario  was not alarmingly  contami-
nated.26  Nevertheless,  lawsuits kept  the residents'  complaints  steadily in the
news. 27

In June  1978,  frightening  stories in the Niagara Falls  Gazette came to the
attention  of Lois Marie  Gibbs,  a housewife  living in the  area.2 8  Gibbs,  who
became president  of the  Love  Canal Homeowners  Association,  played a key
role  in reinforcing  fears  of adverse  health  effects  and mobilizing  public  at-
tention. 29  Indeed,  she  would  eventually  appear  on  national  television  pro-
grams  and receive  invitations to the  state capitol and even the  White House °
In  brief, she  served  as  a  leading  availability  entrepreneur  of the  episode,
which  culminated  in  the  passage  of the  Comprehensive  Environmental  Re-
sponse,  Compensation  and Liability Act  (CERCLA),  generally  known  as the
Superfund  statute.3'

Angered  by claims  in the  Gazette, Gibbs  organized  a petition  drive  and
started  going  door-to-door  to mobilize  protests, eventually  developing  "a set
speech. 3 2  Partly as  a result  of these efforts, the local  residents  held a meet-
ing, and those who "hadn't attended the meeting heard  what was going  on by

27.  Eventually,  ninety-five percent  of the residents  settled for  $20  million with Hooker's par-
ent company,  Occidental  Petroleum.  There have been  ninety additional lawsuits by individuals  who
chose not to be a part of the class  action, and two  other major settlements.  In the mid-1990s,  Occi-
dental settled with  the  State of New  York for $98  million and  with the federal government  for $129
million.  See  Sarah  Lubman,  Occidental Settles Love  Canal Waste Suit with  New  York for up to

word  of mouth.  Everybody  was  very  curious. 33  The  local  health  depart-
ment initially  attempted  to  counter the  campaign  by  referring  to  controlled
studies  that  found  no  evidence  of leukemia  or  even  of low  or  fluctuating
counts  of white blood  cells.  But because  the health  department  provided  no
interpretation  of  what  the  numbers  meant,  they  "had  no  meaning"  for  the
residents,  and concerns  did not dampen.34  "One  woman,  divorced  and  with
three  sick  children,  looked  at the  piece  of paper  with numbers  and  starting
crying  hysterically:  'No  wonder  my  children  are  sick.  Am I  going  to  die?
What's  going to  happen  to  my children?"' 35  Notwithstanding  the results  of
scientific  investigations,  she  felt that "no  one  could answer. '36  Her anxieties
and  fears  came  to  be  shared  by  the  entire  community,  which  united  around
the  problem:  "People  who had  been  feuding  because  little Johnny  hit little
Billy were now talking to  each other.  They  had air readings in common  ....
The  word  spread  fast,  and  the  community  became  close-knit.  Everywhere
you  looked,  there  were  people  in  little  groups  talking  and  wondering  and
worrying."

37

Responding  to  the  outcry, New York  State Health Commissioner  Robert
Whalen  declared  a public  health  emergency  in  the  area  in  early  August  of
1978.3
3  Characterizing Love  Canal as a "great  and imminent  peril," he  urged
area  residents  to  stay  out  of their  basements  and  to  avoid  eating  anything
from their gardens. 39  He also  sought the  temporary relocation  of twenty-five
pregnant  women  and  children  under  two  years  old,  whereupon  residents
whom  the  plan would  leave behind inquired  why their  own health  should be
treated  as  less  important.  Gibbs,  now  a  widely  recognized  activist  on  the
issue,  was furious.

I jumped up  and  said  to  Commissioner  Whalen:  "If the  dump  will  hurt preg-
nant  women  and  children  under  two,  what for  God's  sake,  is it  going  to  do to
the rest of us!?  What do you think you're  doing?"  Now very emotional,  I said;
"You  can't do that! That would be murder!" 40

She  and her  associates  treated  technical  explanations  as just "a  bunch  of ba-
loney."'41  They  also  instructed  residents  to  report  to  doctors  and  local  offi-
cials  any  and  all  suspected  health  abnormalities.  "Tell  them  everything,"
Gibbs exhorted,  "If you had three pimples this time  last month,  and this time
you have  five-tell them!" 42

A  month  later,  in  September  1978,  Whalen  published  a  report  entitled
Love  Canal: Public Health Time  Bomb,  which  described  Love  Canal  as  a
"modem  day  disaster"  that  was  "both  profound  and  devastating. '43  Other
government  officials  either  expressed  agreement  with Whalen's  concerns  or
simply  stood  silent.  Meanwhile,  Governor  Hugh  Carey,  who  was  in  the
midst  of a close contest for re-election,  was trying to be at least as responsive
to the concerns  as Whalen.44  The  stakes  for his political  career were  already
obvious,  and  the  residents  would reinforce  the  point  by  screaming  at  him:
"You're a murderer! You're killing our children!" 45  In early August, he  cre-
ated  a multi-agency  Love  Canal  task force  and promised state  aid  for the lo-
cality.46  And two  weeks  later he agreed that 239  of the  families  living clos-
est to  the  canal  would  be relocated  at  state  expense.4 7  The  federal  govern-
ment,  too, responded  to  the  growing  sense  of crisis.  The  top  official  of the
Federal  Disaster  Assistance  Administration  toured  the  area  very  visibly  on
August  5,  1978,  and  two  days  later  President  Jimmy  Carter  declared  an
emergency in the  area. 48

Within  a  few  days  of Carter's  declaration,  scientists  re-examining  the
evidence  began  signaling  that  the  dangers  were  being  overblown.  Their
findings prompted some government  officials,  including Carey, to tone  down
their  statements.49  But fears  would not  dissipate.  On  the  contrary,  they  in-
tensified when certain  new studies, presented before  Congress  in early  1979,
pointed  to  sky-high  rates  of nervous  breakdown,  miscarriage,  and  various
diseases  of the urinary system in the Love  Canal  area.50  These  data would be
thoroughly  discredited  two  years  later;51 some  of the  effects  were  evidently
fictitious,  and others were undoubtedly  produced by panic;  but at the time the
data  were  widely  reported  as  scientifically  sound.52  To  call  for  caution  in
interpreting  the  data,  even  to  question  their  validity,  was  to  risk  fierce  and
widespread  criticism.53  Information  that  flowed  rapidly  among  groups  was
heightening  anxieties,  and  those  who  challenged  the  prevailing  interpreta-
tions of Love Canal were  being labeled  as accessories  to a heinous cover-up.

The  title  of an  ABC  television  program  on Love  Canal  is representative
of the perceptions  that now held currency  nationwide:  The Killing Ground.54
Similar  programs  followed.  In  October  1979,  for instance,  public  television
aired  a  documentary  on  toxic waste,  with  a  long  segment  on  Love  Canal.55
Gibbs  made  every  effort  to  keep  the nation  focused  on  Love  Canal.  "One
day,  we  decided  we'd  take  a  child's  coffin  and  an  adult  coffin  to  the  state
capitol  ...  . It was a way of keeping  us in the news. '5 6

In January  1980  the Justice Department  commissioned  a study that found
chromosomal  abnormalities in  eleven of thirty-six Love  Canal residents.  The
study  would  eventually  be  discredited  as  scientifically  flawed,  but  it  was
leaked  to the  press before  peer review at the  EPA, and in May  the New  York
Times promptly  gave  it front-page  coverage. 57  The  news  media  descended
on  Love  Canal  once  again,  painting  the  image  of an  ordinary  American
community mired in  a swamp  of carcinogenic  wastes as the  rest of the coun-
try just watched.  A  resident  found  to  have  chromosomal  aberrations  ap-
peared  on  national  television,  sobbing  that  she  "just wanted  to  be  a  house-
wife"  as  in  the  days  before the  poisons  of Love Canal  destroyed  her idyllic
life.5 8

In  early  1980,  at  a  time  when  Love  Canal  was  prominently  featured  in
network  newscasts  almost  every  day,  Governor  Carey  established  a  blue-
ribbon  panel to review the  scientific  evidence.  Remarkably,  given the politi-
cal  climate,  the  panel  endorsed  none of the  reports  of serious health  effects.
However,  its evaluation  had  no  appreciable  influence  on subsequent  events.
In  May of the  same  year, a group  of Love  Canal  residents held  two EPA of-
ficials  hostage  at  the  headquarters  of the  Homeowners  Association.5 9  The
next day  President Carter ordered the relocation  of an additional  700  families
at  a  cost of at  least  $3 million.60  And  soon  thereafter,  exploiting  the  Presi-
dent's  need  for  his  support  in  the  Kennedy-Carter  contest  for  that  year's
Democratic  Presidential  nomination,  Carey  obtained  $15  million  in  federal
assistance  toward the purchase of new homes  for the relocated residents. 61

The Love Canal "time bomb,"  as the press dubbed  it,62 was not the origi-
nal  source  of government  concern  about abandoned  hazardous  waste  dumps.
Even before  the  1978  news blitz, the EPA had worked  on  drafting  an  ambi-
tious new law to  address  contamination  problems.  But publicity  about Love
Canal  was  crucial  to  this law's passage  in  1980.  Love  Canal,  and its  atten-
dant publicity,  was  a watershed  event  that crystallized  public  concern  about
toxic waste  sites.  In that year,  Time magazine made the topic of waste sites a
cover story, and new network  documentaries  followed  suit.  Polls conducted
at the  time showed that all this publicity dramatically  influenced the views of
Americans  about industrial  wastes:  Eighty  percent  favored  prompt  federal
action to identify and clean up potentially hazardous  abandoned waste  sites.63
Congress  responded  quickly  with  the  Superfund  statute,  which  called  for
$1.6  billion in expenditures  over five years.64

The  perceptual  and  attitudinal  transformation  that  occurred  between
1978  and 1980  has proved enduring.  Since that period, Americans  have con-
sistently  ranked  waste  sites  among  the  country's  top  environmental  prob-
lems.  In a highly publicized  1987  study, the  EPA found that Americans rank
hazardous waste  sitesfirst among all  environmental  problems-above  pesti-
cides,  acid rain,  indoor  air pollution,  radioactive  waste,  water pollution,  ex-
posure  to  work  site  chemicals,  tap-water  contamination,  and  thinning  of the
ozone  layer,  among  many  others.65  This  preeminence  was  confirmed  by
public  opinion polls  in  1987  and  1988.66  To  this date,  moreover,  American
presidents  and  serious  presidential  candidates  of both  major  parties  invoke
abandoned  waste  dumps as  a  leading  environmental  problem.  Congress  has
continued  to  spend  vast sums  on  clean-up  campaigns.  By  1994 it had  allo-

cated a total  of $13.6  billion to  the cause. 67  Yet  it remains  unproven  that the
contamination  of Love  Canal,  assuming  it occurred,  ever posed a  significant
risk to anyone.  Peer-reviewed  follow-up  studies conducted  by the  New York
State  Department  of  Health  uncovered  no  abnormal  health  trends  among
Love Canal residents,  and this finding was  supported by  later analyses by the
American  Medical  Association,  the  National  Research  Council,  and  the
Centers for Disease  Control and  Prevention. 63  Equally significant,  no subse-
quent  study  discovered  any  link between  the  identified  chromosome  altera-
tions  and  the  contamination  in  question.  An  exhaustive  1982  study by  the
EPA,  based  on  6000  samples  of soil,  air,  and  groundwater  from  the  evacu-
ated  area  and other  sampling regions,  found  "no  evidence  of environmental
contamination"  at  Love  Canal.69  And  in  the  same  year  the  Department  of
Health  and Human  Services found  that the emergency  zone was  "as habitable
as the  control  areas with which it was  compared. '70  A  recent analysis  of the
data  goes much  further.  Looking beyond  Love  Canal, it suggests  that "haz-
ardous waste  sites pose an almost negligible  risk to  human health when com-
pared with the many more  fundamental  risks we face. '71

program,  the  social  significance  of the  analytical  challenge  should  be  clear.
Had  these  resources  been  devoted  to  the  prevention  of other  risks,  there
could  have  been  major benefits  as  measured  in,  say,  life-years  saved.  Ap-
proximately  400,000  Americans  die  each  year  as  a  result  of  tobacco  use,
300,000  die  from  poor  diet  and  insufficient  exercise,  and  many  thousands
more die  each year from  other preventable  causes.72  The  scientific  evidence
is  overwhelming  that  poor  diet  produces  far more  cancers  than  abandoned
hazardous  waste  sites.  Yet  during  the  period  of skyrocketing  concern  over
Love  Canal,  poor  diet  and exercise  received  almost no  attention  as  national

public  health  warnings. 
Indeed,  until  quite  recently  governments  devoted
negligible  resources  to  fighting  these  causes  of death,  with  the exception  of
modest  informational  campaigns  against  smoking,  which  were  undermined
by generous  subsidies to  tobacco farmers.  At much less  than the  cost of Su-
perfund,  tax  incentives  and  informational  campaigns  to  promote better  diet
and exercise could probably have saved tens of thousands  of lives per year.

We  do not mean to imply that choosing priorities is simply a technocratic
matter,  nor  that  informed  democratic  judgments  should  never  depart  from
numerical  criteria.  The  guiding principles  of priority-setting  should involve
subtle  qualitative  considerations,  which  will be  brought into  our  analysis  in
due  course.  Suffice  it to  say  here  that the  priority  accorded  to  abandoned
waste  dumps  hardly  reflects  what  one  would  call  the  informed  judgment of
the American  citizenry.

B.  Alar

In the  interest  of reaching  the  theoretical  core  of our  argument  expedi-
tiously, our next two  examples  of availability  cascades  are more compressed
than  the foregoing  account  of the  Love  Canal  episode.  A  salient phenome-
non  in American  environmental  politics  is the  "pollutant of the month"  syn-
drome.  The  essence  of this  syndrome  is  that  expressed  concerns  about  a
particular  substance  fuel  growing anxieties,  which then  generate  an irresisti-
ble demand  for regulation.  These anxieties  remain in the headlines  until they
are bumped  off by a new perceived  hazard.73

In  1989,  one  such pollutant  was Alar,  a pesticide  long  used  on apples. 74
About  one  percent  of Alar  is  composed  of UDMH,  a  carcinogen.  Alar's
manufacturer,  the  Uniroyal  Company,  embarked  on  a  two-year  study  of its
effects,  reaching  the half-point  of the  investigation  in  January  1989. 75  The
preliminary  results  showed  that  in  rats  and  mice  exposed  to  moderate
amounts  of Alar,  there  is no  change in  the  incidence  of tumors.76  But  they
also indicated  a greater incidence  of tumors in rodents  exposed to high levels
of UDMH.  On  the  basis  of these  tentative  findings,  the Natural  Resources
Defense  Council  (NRDC)  made  a  series  of extrapolations,  interpreting  the
results  as implying that between  4700 and  6200 preschool  children,  or about
one  out  of every  4200 exposed  to  Alar,  will develop  cancer  by age  six.77  A

lawyer for the NRDC said,  "If EPA doesn't think that the  most potent  cancer
causing  chemical  in  our food  supply  is  grounds  enough  to declare  it an im-
minent hazard  and remove  it from food, well, I don't know what kind  of risk
it takes then to declare  an imminent chemical hazard. 78

The  television  show  60 Minutes publicized  the  allegation,  presenting  its
report  against  a  background  consisting  of a red  apple  overlaid  with  a  skull
and  crossbones.79  Ed  Bradley,  the  program's  host, began  the  report  as  fol-
lows:  "The  most potent cancer-causing  chemical  in our food supply is  a sub-
stance  sprayed  on  apples  to  keep  them  on the  trees  longer  and  make  them
look better."80  The  story received wide  coverage  in  newspapers, magazines,
talk shows, and  television news  programs.  It also  instigated a public outcry,
complete  with  protests  from  many  celebrities,  including  actress  Meryl
Streep,  who  founded  an  activist group  called Mothers  and  Others  for  Pesti-
cide Limits.81  The NRDC's  self-conscious  agenda was

to create  so many repetitions  of [its] message  that average American consumers
(not just the  policy elite in Washington)  could not avoid hearing  it-from many
different  media  outlets  within  a  short  time.  The  idea  was  for  the  'story'  to
achieve  a life  of its  own,  and  continue  for weeks  and  months  to  affect  policy
and consumer habits.82
The  EPA reviewed  the  evidence  and  interpretations,  concluding  that the
one  in  111,000  rather  than  one  in  4200.83
risk  was  vastly  exaggerated: 
However,  by  the  time  the  EPA  made  its  announcement,  the  demand  for  ap-
ples  had  plummeted.  Apples  and  apple  products  had  been  removed  from
stores  and  widely  banned  from  school  lunchrooms.  Many  people  were
treating  apples  as  a  highly  toxic  substance  that  one  must handle  with  great
care,  and  only  when  absolutely  necessary.  Moreover,  doctors  and  poison-
control  centers  were  facing  a  deluge  of calls  from  frightened parents.  One
caller  asked  "whether  it was  safer  to  pour apple  juice  down  the  drain  or  to
take  it to  a  toxic waste  dump. '8 4  In  desperation,  the  nation's  apple  growers
asked Uniroyal  to  withdraw Alar  from  the market.  And before  the year was
out, but after the EPA  announcement,  Uniroyal  agreed to stop domestic  sales
of Alar,  evidently  to  avoid the  costs  of contested  cancellation  proceedings. 85
The  EPA  itself joined  the  alarmist  bandwagon  by announcing  that  it would

81.  The intensity  of the Alar scare might have  stemmed, in part,  from the resonance  of a cul-
turally very available  text:  the biblical story of the fall  of Adam and  Eve.  This is speculation,  to be
sure, but many risk-related  scares  draw some of their intensity  from links to pre-existing  fears.

seek  revisions  of pertinent  laws  and  regulations  to  make  it  easier  to  ban
chemicals  suspected  of being carcinogenic. 86

Furious  about  the  whole  episode,  the  apple  growers  brought  product
defamation  suits against  the  NRDC  and  60 Minutes.87  But  the expenses  as-
sociated with this suit constitute  only a small  fraction of the social  costs gen-
erated  by  the  hysteria  over  Aar's hazards.  In  Washington  State  alone,  the
harm to the apple  industry  included  at least $125  million in losses  in the key
six-month  period. 88  The United  States Department  of Agriculture put  aside
$15  million  to buy some  of the  surplus  apples. 89  For all these costs,  it is not
even clear  that the  withdrawal  of Alar resulted  in a  net benefit  to children's
health.  A  regulatory  strategy  that makes  apples  more  expensive  will  lower
their  consumption,  producing  adverse  health  effects  that  may  swamp  any
benefits  from eliminating Alar.  These  observations  suggest that Alar's  with-
drawal may not have survived  any form of cost-benefit  analysis.  In any case,
the EPA's initial  risk estimate  has turned  out to  be too high.  According  to its
subsequent  analyses,  only  one  in 250,000  children  exposed to  Alar  will  de-
velop  cancer-doubtless  a  nontrivial  risk, but less  than  half the initial  EPA
figure,  and lower than that  of the NRDC by a factor  of sixty.90  Thus a  1991
editorial  in Science argues  that "a  clearly dubious  report  about possible  car-
cinogenicity  by  a  special  interest  group  was  hyped  by  a news  organization
without  the  most  simple  checks  on  its  reliability  or  documentation." 91  A
United  Nations  panel,  along  with  others  who  have  investigated  the  data,
found  that even  the  EPA's  revised  figure  is  too  high.  Alar  does  not  cause
cancer  in mice, it concluded,  and it is not dangerous  to people. 92

A VAILABILITY  CASCADES

The  process  that  drove  the  Alar  scare  provides  another  example  of an
availability  campaign  launched by  availability  entrepreneurs.  The  following
account puts  it dramatically:

Words  fail  on Alar.  The most  charitable  interpretation  is that  an  environ-
mental  group  ...  decided to take  matters into  its own hands by  writing a report
and  orchestrating  its  release to the  media in  so forceful  a manner  as to  compel
governmental  action.  The  syndrome  its report  played  out  is  by now  distress-
ingly  familiar:  a  few  suggestive  tests  involving  tiny  quantities  raised  way
above the  actual  amount by extreme  assumptions about  children's  eating  habits,
expanded  further by statistical  manipulation,  extrapolated  against  huge popula-
tions to create  row-upon-row of child cancer victims.93
Once  Aar  became  identified  as  a  threat  to  social  welfare  and,  in  par-
ticular, the lives  of helpless  children,  it became  risky  to urge restraint  in in-
terpreting  the  figures.  No  official,  and  certainly  no  politician,  wants  to  de-
velop  a reputation  for softness  on matters  vital  to  children's  health.  Nor, in
the  face  of reports  of danger  to  children,  is any  official  eager  to tell  worried
parents  that they should  patiently  wait  for more scientific  research.  If some
doubters  and dissenters  shade their  views  or mute their  voices in response  to
such reservations,  the  relative  content  of the  publicly  available  information
will  obviously  get  distorted.  Specifically,  information  pointing  to  danger
will  become  ever  more  available,  raising  its  plausibility  in  the  eyes  of the
many people who  use availability  as a  criterion for evaluating  the  validity of
such  information.  In  the  process,  moreover,  the  burden  of justifying  one's
beliefs  will  shift increasingly  toward  dissenters.  Thus,  as  the  Aar  cascade
took  off, the  proponents  of banning Aar  could increasingly  take  for granted
that  their  safety  concerns  would  be  treated  with respect.  For  their part, the
opponents  had  to  carry  an  increasingly  heavy  burden  of being  suspected  of
insensitivity to human  suffering.

With  Alar off the  market,  apple  growers  were  quick to  find  substitutes.
These  substitutes  might well  be equally  effective  against pests  without hav-
ing  the minute  adverse  side-effects  of Aar.  But we have  no  scientific basis
for  ruling  out  the  possibility  of a  serious  mistake.  The  substitutes  may
someday be identified as  serious hazards.  In any case,  even  if future histori-
ans  judge  the  Aar  episode  to  have  reached  an  acceptable  or  even  happy
ending,  there  are  socially  cheaper  ways  to  bring  about  a  substitution  of in-
dustrial  inputs.  It  should  not be  necessary  to  cause  widespread  panic  or to
disrupt production and consumption patterns  for the  sake  of preventing  a du-
bious or minor hazard.

C.  TWA  Flight 800

Mass  demand for regulation can develop especially  quickly in reaction to
events  that involve  many deaths.  An immediate public reaction  to a particu-
lar  event  that  makes  millions  of  people  simultaneously  and  independently
detect  a  serious  risk does not constitute  an  availability  cascade.  Indeed,  the
availability  heuristic may come  into play without cascade  effects.  Independ-
ent  uses  of the heuristic  could have  social  effects-they  could  even produce
law-but  they would  work on the  outcome  directly, without triggering reac-
tions by others.  Yet sometimes  a single event will trigger  a rapid availability
cascade.  A  cascade  is  at  work  whenever  some  people's  alarmist  reactions
instill  fear  in  others,  whose  own reactions  then  sow fears  in  still  more  indi-
viduals.

A  striking  example  of a  quick availability  cascade  involves  reactions  to
the  1996  crash  of TWA  flight  800,  which  killed  all  230  people  on  board.
With about ninety-five  percent of the  wreckage  now  recovered,  the cause  of
the  accident  remains  unknown,  although  none  of the  evidence  implicates  a
bomb  or  a  missile.  Nevertheless,  the  public  outcry that  followed  the  crash
quickly led to heightened  security measures  at  airports  all  across  the  United
States  and  to  the  formation  of the White  House  Commission  on  Aviation,
Safety, and Security. 94

There  are  indications  that  the  relevant  government  officials  did not  be-
lieve  that the crash resulted from terrorism;  but with wild rumors circulating,
and with denials  of terrorist activity  seeming  callous  or reckless, they  simply
pretended  to  take  the  claims  seriously  when  expressing  themselves  publicly.
A mere  forty-five  days  after its creation,  the  White House  Commission  pro-
posed extensive  additional  safeguards  against terrorism.  And within  a month
of this  initial report,  President Clinton signed  most of the  Commission's rec-
ommendations  into  law.  The  direct  cost to  taxpayers  was  estimated  to  be
$400 million per year.95  The total  price tag, including  all costs to  consumers
and producers, apparently  exceeds an estimated  $6  billion.96

Yet the  new security measures  may  not save  any lives.  On  the  contrary,
they  may  even  cost lives.  Having  made  airline  travel  more  expensive  and
more cumbersome,  these measures  have reduced the relative attractiveness  of
flying.  Flying, however, is  far less  dangerous  than driving.  In fact,  air travel
is now  the safest mode  of transportation.97  Between  1960  and 1995  the fatal

accident  rate  in  commercial  aviation  dropped  from  0.011  fatal  accidents  per
million aircraft  miles  flown  to  0.0005. 91  By making  some  people  substitute
car travel  for  air travel,  then, the adopted  measures  may well  increase, rather
than decrease,  the number of unnatural  deaths.99

Additional  examples from recent years  include mass outcries  over Agent
Orange,  asbestos  in  schools,  and  automobile  airbags  that  endanger  chil-
dren.1°°  Each  of these  cases has  culminated  in politically  irresistible  public
demands  for government  action.  Their common  thread is that people  tended
to  form their  risk judgments  largely, if not entirely,  on the  basis  of informa-
tion  produced  through  a  social process,  rather  than through personal  experi-
ence  or investigation.  In  each case,  a public  upheaval  unfolded as  vast num-
bers  of players  reacted  to  each other's  actions  and statements.  And  in each,
the  demand  for  swift,  extensive,  and  costly  government  action  came  to be
considered  morally and  socially desirable-even though,  in most or all cases,
the net benefit of the resulting  regulations may well have been negative. 101

II.  INTERPRETING MASS  SCARES  ABouT MINOR RISKS

What  explains  widespread  fixations  on  unthreatening  waste  dumps,
nearly  harmless  chemicals,  and  unlikely  causes  of a  tragic  airplane  crash,
when for years  on end far more serious  health hazards,  such as breast cancer,
indoor  air pollution,  "junk food"  consumption,  and asthma  in  the inner  city
have  commanded  comparatively  little  attention? 02  What  do  the  episodes
involving Love Canal,  Mar,  and TWA  800  reveal about  the formation  of so-
cial policies?  Do the  underlying  cognitive  and social  mechanisms  carry  les-
sons  for the  social  sciences  or  study  of the  law?  To  what  extent  do  they
complement,  reformulate,  or undermine  accounts  of legislation  and regula-
tion  based  on  the  currently  fashionable  variants  of public  choice  theory? 0 3
Finally, what implications  do the mechanisms have for democratic  theory?

we can tell, nicely illustrate the  phenomenon  of regulatory  action prompted by availability  cascades
rather than sound evidence.  But nothing turns on the selected examples.  If the reader  feels that in a
particular  case  the  scientific  evidence  was  perfectly  adequate  to  justify  the  observed  policy  re-
sponse, the quarrel is not with the general argument  of this  article, but with  our interpretation  of one
particular  example.  As  our  article  makes  clear,  numerous  other  examples  might  have  been pre-
sented instead.

[Vol. 51:683

At  first blush,  the  episodes  in  question  confirm  an  essential  finding  of
cognitive  psychology:  as  individuals,  we  are  capable  of developing  and re-
taining beliefs  that  are  scientifically  unjustified  and even  unjustifiable.  The
basis  for this finding bounded rationality.  Because  our cognitive  limitations
preclude us  from thinking  deeply  about more than  a small fraction  of the is-
sues  that bear on our values, behavior,  and welfare,  we rely on mental  short-
cuts  that  leave  us  misinformed  in  many  contexts,  even  seriously  wrong. 104
The episodes  are consistent  also with  one  of the  central  themes  of the public
choice  school,  namely,  that  citizens  of a  large polity  have  incentives  to  re-
main "rationally  ignorant."'05  Why  should  the  residents  of Love  Canal,  or
the rest of us,  devote  time  and  effort  to  learning  the  full  truth  about the  al-
leged  contamination  when  as  individuals  we  each have  only one  voice  and
one  vote  to  influence  policies  that  the  choices  of many  millions  will  help
shape?  By  the  logic  of rational  ignorance,  if activists  such  as  Lois  Marie
Gibbs or the Natural  Resources  Defense Council  are  exerting massive efforts
on a risk-related  problem, this  is because  their extraordinary  gifts,  or  special
social  circumstances,  or  unusual political  resources,  make  them believe  that
they can  overcome  any obstacles to  collective  action.  As  ordinary  individu-
als we cannot  affect politics  in any meaningful  way  by ourselves,  so most of
us opt  to sit back  and let  activists  shape  public  discourse.  Accordingly,  we
become  informed  about  issues  only  insofar  as  the  learning  process  is  cos-
tless, entertaining, or a matter of civic obligation.

It would be  a mistake,  however, to  treat these  episodes  merely  as  addi-
tional  manifestations  of bounded  rationality  and  rational  ignorance.  Both
interpretations raise the  question of why, in each case, millions  of Americans
fell victim to  exactly  the  same delusion.  People  evidently  formed their per-
ceptions  interdependently,  with  each  individual's  expressed  perceptions
helping  to  shape those of others.  As  a  vivid case  in point,  the perceptions  of
the  Love  Canal  residents  took  shape,  in  significant  measure,  through  their
frequent  meetings  and informal  communications.  Equally  important, invok-
ing bounded  rationality  or rational  ignorance  sidesteps  the  challenge  of ex-
plaining  why people  came  to believe  what they  did.  By  1979,  few  mentally

competent  Americans,  and  probably  none living  in  the  Love  Canal  region,
were  "rationally  ignorant"  about the  canal's  contamination.  However  severe
their  cognitive limitations,  millions  of Americans knew  something,  and what
they knew was  converging  to generate  an alarming  view about the dangers  of
industrial  wastes.

What  Americans "knew"  depended,  in  the  first instance,  on their predis-
position  to  believe  certain  claims  more readily than  others.  Our next task  is
to  identify the  cognitive mechanisms  and biases  that impinge  on risk percep-
tions  and preferences.  Turning  subsequently  to  the social processes  at work,
we will explore  how these  interact with psychological  processes  to  fuel mass
delusions  that have  large consequences  for regulatory policy.

A.  Cognitive Processes

Cognitive  findings  about  risk  perception  are  generally  studied  through
laboratory  experiments.  Over the  past  quarter-century,  cognitive  psycholo-
gists  have  reported  a  bewildering  array  of findings,  and  the  publication  of
new  findings  continues. 10 6  These  findings  fall  into  several  categories.  The
following  is a  summary  of this increasingly  complex  literature,  with  an  em-
phasis  on what is critical  for our purposes.

1.  Biases and heuristics.

A  number  of experiments  have  identified  systematic  problems  in  the
ways  people receive,  store,  retrieve,  and  process  information.  A particularly
relevant  problem  stems  from  the  framing effect,  whereby  given  data  are
evaluated  differently  depending on how they are framed.  A striking  example
is  that people  are more  eager to  undergo  treatment  for an  ailment when they
hear  that ninety  percent  of the  patients  treated  five years  ago  are  still  alive
than  when  they  learn  that  ten  percent  of the  treated  patients  have  died. I0 7
Other relevant experiments  on probability  assessments  uncover  an anchoring
effect,  by  which  an initial judgment  or number,  such  as  a preliminary  guess
of the  probability  of falling  victim  to  terrorism,  serves  as  a perceptual  "an-
chor."  The  anchor influences  the  assessment  reached  after  adjusting  or  up-
dating  in  the  light  of new  information.  For  example,  if the  initial  figure  is
one in  10,000,  the ultimate  assessment  will be lower than if the  initial  figure
was  one  in  100.  The  anchoring  effect  helps  explain  damages  awards  made

106.  Many  of the most  influential  reports  of these  experiments  are  included  in  two  antholo-
gies: JUDGMENT  AND  DECISION  MAKING:  AN  INTERDISCIPLINARY  READER  (Hal R.  Arkes  & Ken-
neth R.  Hammond eds.,  1986)  and JUDGMENT  UNDER  UNCERTAINTY,  supra note  1.  For a selection

by juries. 108  It undoubtedly  also  contributes  to perceptions  of environmental
risks;  consider  the  immense  difficulty  of persuading  people  who have  heard
that  a waste  site  poses  a huge  danger  to  believe  that it  is  actually  safe.  A
highly  relevant  bias is  the  alarmist bias.  When  confronted  with  a range  of
information  suggestive  of  probabilities,  people  searching  for  a  residential
community tend to  focus  on the most alarming  situations that they might en-
counter.10 9  In other  words,  the  worst possible  scenarios  loom  large  in peo-
ple's minds, distorting their risk perceptions  and their behaviors.

Much remains unknown  about the mental processes responsible  for these
various  effects.  What is  clear  is  that many  errors  result  from the  cognitive
shortcuts,  or  heuristics,  that  we  use  in  processing, information.110  The  an-
choring effect is an example of a distortion generated by a heuristic.  Another
key  heuristic is  the representativeness heuristic, a mental  shortcut  by which
causes  are  treated as resembling their effects. 1 
"A person  who follows  this
heuristic  evaluates  the  probability  of an uncertain  event,  or  a sample, by the
degree  to  which  it is:  (i) similar  in essential  properties  to  its parent popula-
tion;  and  (ii) reflects the  salient  feature of the process  by which it was gener-
ated."112  For our purposes, the most critical  heuristic  is the availability heu-
ristic, which  involves  estimating  the  probability  of an  event  on  the basis  of
how easily instances  of it can be brought to mind. 1 3  This heuristic  can pro-
duce  substantial  distortions  whenever  certain  alternatives  are  easier to  imag-
ine  than  others.  Thus,  a  person  may  overestimate  the  incidence  of AIDS
simply because  many of his acquaintances  have the  disease  and he can  easily
think  of AIDS  cases.  Alternatively,  a  person  may  underestimate  the  inci-
dence  of AIDS  because he cannot think of anyone  who is  among its  victims.
An independent but closely related phenomenon  involves salience and vivid-
ness:  salient  or vivid information  makes a far  greater impression  than dry or
statistical information.1 14

The  availability  heuristic  can  obviously  produce  judgmental  mistakes
with  unfortunate  behavioral  consequences." 5   The  ease  with  which  an
event's  occurrences  can be recalled  need not have  any  bearing  on  its  actual
frequency.11 6  Insofar  as we  estimate  the  incidence  of a disease  with  the aid
of the  availability  heuristic,  we fail  to  compensate  for special  characteristics
of our own knowledge,  experience,  memories,  and acquaintances;  as  a result,
our judgments  contain systematic  errors  that make  us behave  either too  cau-
tiously  or not cautiously  enough.  Likewise,  if alarmist  information  is  more
salient,  and  thus  more  readily  recalled,  we  may  end  up  exaggerating  the
gravity of certain  risks.

It  is  undoubtedly  true  that  in  certain  contexts  cognitive  heuristics  will
produce  beneficial  results  while  economizing  on  decision  costs.  But  their
redeeming  features  should  not  be  overstated,  for  the  results  of the  econo-
mizing can be very harmful.' 7  Indeed, people systematically  err in assessing
the number  of deaths  due  to  particular risks.  While underestimating  dangers
that  are  not  highly publicized  (heart  disease,  strokes,  asthma),  they  grossly
overestimate  risks  to  which  the  media  pay  a  great  deal  of attention  (acci-
dents, electrocution).'

2.  Prospect theory.

Cognitive psychologists  have  also  uncovered  distinctive  features  of the
value  functions  through  which  people  evaluate  risks  and options." 9  These
findings  cast  serious  doubt  on  expected  utility  theory,  which  provides  the
behavioral  basis for vast segments  of the  contemporary  social  sciences.120  A
key  finding  is  the  certainty effect.  Because  people  attach  intrinsic  value  to
certainty, their well-being  improves more when  the probability  of an adverse
effect drops  from  1.0%  to zero  than when  it drops  from 2.1%  to  1.0%.121  Put
differently, their utility changes  exhibit a discontinuity at the point where the
risk  in  question  disappears.  An  equally  striking  finding  is  loss  aversion,

caused by the availability heuristic).

119.  The domain  of these  features,  and  the  inconsistencies  between  prospect  theory  and  ex-

pected utility theory, remain contested issues.  See Jolls et al., supra note  13,  at 1535-36.

which  is the tendency  to  benefit less from  a given  gain than to be harmed by
an  equivalent  loss. 122  People  experience  less  satisfaction  from  winning,  say,
a $100  prize than  they feel  dissatisfaction upon  finding out that the prize has
been cancelled.  The disparity can be enormous. 2 3

Whether  a particular  change  qualifies  as  a loss  or  a gain  depends  on  the
relevant reference  point, which  can be manipulated.  Is  a change  in the  risk
associated  with  some  environmental  hazard  a  loss  or  a  gain?  The  answer
could  well  depend  on  whether  the  reference  point  is  1979  or  1999.  Loss
aversion thus  implies  that one  can  distort policy evaluations  through  framing
effects. 124  Like  loss aversion,  the  certainty  effect can be triggered by choos-
ing an  appropriate  reference  point.  We  will  show later how  the certainty  ef-
fect and loss aversion  connect with the  availability  heuristic  to  shape,  and be
shaped by, availability  cascades. 125

3.  The relative acceptability of risks.

Yet another  set of findings  involves the  qualitative  features that  enhance
or diminish  the  acceptability  of risks.1 26  Most people  are  not  functionaries
seeking  to  maximize  life-years  through  regulation.  Interested  as they  are  in
leading meaningful,  comfortable,  balanced, and morally satisfying lives,  they
care  about  the  qualitative  differences  among  risks.  These  differences  thus
generate  diverse  acceptability effects  that  shape  their pertinent  preferences
and values.

One  particular  acceptability  effect  is  the  controllability effect,  which
makes  a given risk more tolerable  insofar  as it appears  controllable. 127  Risks
associated  with  driving  arouse  less  concern  than  those  of  flying,  because
people  think  that they  have  relatively  more  control  over  the  former.  Like-
wise,  people treat the risks  of mountain climbing  as a negligible  social prob-
lem insofar  as  they  perceive  those  risks  as  controllable  through  equipment
choice, path selection,  or  simply picking  a different  adventure.  The  control-

lability  effect constitutes just one  of the many ways in which lay evaluations
differ  from  those  of experts.  In  addition  to  controllability,  ordinary  people
pay  special attention  to risks that  are potentially  catastrophic,  likely to  affect
future  generations,  inequitably  distributed,  or  involuntarily  incurred.  And
they  de-emphasize  risks with natural  origins  or unidentifiable  victims.  The

[Vol. 51:683

Many  of these  acceptability  effects  require  further  analysis.  The  line
between controllable  and uncontrollable  risks is usually  one  of degree,  not of
kind.  Likewise,  there  is  no  sharp  distinction  between  voluntary  and  invol-
untary  risks. 29  For  our  purposes,  however,  the basic  point  is  that  various
characteristics  of risks  affect lay judgments  about  whether  they call  for pub-
lic  regulation.  These  characteristics  go  much  beyond  the  actuarial  tables
used by policy experts.

4.  Beyond individual psychology: the role of social influences.

All  three of the reviewed  classes  of cognitive  findings  about risk percep-
tion-biases  and heuristics,  prospect  theory, and acceptability  of risks-have
obvious  importance,  and they  have  started  to receive  considerable  attention
in  studies  of policy making  and  the  law.1 30  But  even  collectively these  find-
ings  leave major  gaps.  They  say nothing  about  the  social  dimensions  of in-
formation  acquisition,  retrieval,  processing,  and transmission,  and  they  dis-
regard  the  social  mechanisms  that  shape  risk judgments  and preferences. 131
In the  typical laboratory  experiment  involving risk judgments or preferences,
experimenters  tightly control all sources  of information,  and subjects  are kept
from communicating  with one  another.  Prevented  from  sharing  information,
the  subjects  solve  problems  and  answer  questions  in  isolation  from  others.
By  design,  therefore,  there  are  no  interdependencies  among  individual  re-
sponses. 132

Outside  of laboratory  settings, of course,  people  consult each  other; they
learn from  each other;  they influence  one another's  values;  they  defer to each
other;  they share sources  of public information;  they try to mold  each other's
beliefs  and values;  and  their social  interactions  shape  their  knowledge,  per-
ceptions,  and interpretations.  In sum, social processes  contribute  to  the evo-
lution  of risk  perceptions  and  also  to  the  formation  and  transformation  of

heuristics, and  the relative acceptability  of risks); Jolls  et al.,  supra note  13,  at 1476-78  (discussing
biases and  heuristics as well as prospect  theory).

Judgment and Choice: People As Politicians, in RESEARCH ON JUDGMENT AND  DECISION MAKING,
supra note  106,  at 657.  Tetlock has  conducted  experiments  that  tend to  support  the analysis  pre-
sented here.  See,  in particular, his  discussion of the "acceptability  heuristic,"  whereby people strive
to say things that others will  find acceptable.  See id. at 662-65.

have potentially  huge  effects.  See John  0. Ledyard,  Public Goods: A  Survey of Experimental Re-
search, in  THE  HANDBOOK  OF EXPERIMENTAL  ECONOMICS  111,  156  (John  H. Kagel  & Alvin E.

relevant preferences.  These processes  interact with all  of the biases, heuris-
tics, and effects  discussed above.

B.  Interactions Between Social and Cognitive Influences: The Centrality of

the Availability Heuristic

Let us  consider  a  few  cases  in  point.  The frames through  which  indi-
viduals  interpret  a  situation  are  generally  formed  socially.  Their  reference
points for assessing  gains and  losses are  generally  given  by popular  conven-
tions  and  communicated  through  conversation,  not  chosen  by  individuals
autonomously.  Anchors, which  in principle  can vary  enormously  across  in-
dividuals,  are in practice  the product of social interactions  and widely shared
information  flows.  For example,  a key  anchor for  a damages  award  will be
the  same for every member  of a jury by virtue of the plaintiff s request.

In  contexts  involving  risks,  then, both  perceptions  of a  risk  and  its  ac-
ceptability  are  framed socially.  Whether  people  feel  in control of a risk  and
what they consider  representative of it are both determined  through their in-
teractions  with  others.  This is  consistent  with findings  that perceptions  and
attitudes  toward  any  given  risk  can  vary  greatly  across  cultures  and  in  any
given  culture  across  time. 133  Indeed,  an  objectively  fixed  danger  can appear
controllable  in  one  decade  but uncontrollable  in  another,  and  enormous  in
one  country but negligible  in another.  During the  Love  Canal  episode,  resi-
dents  heard  stories  from  each  other;  politicians  fueled  fears  through  state-
ments  sympathetic  to  the  apparent  concerns;  and  the  media  reported  such
developments  to  the  entire  nation,  compounding  the  fears  of both  the  Love
Canal residents  and people who lived, or believed they might live, near  other
abandoned  waste  dumps.  Perceptions  and  fears  fed  on  each  other.  Thus,
neither the  information that individuals received  and processed  nor their con-
sequent  sensitivities were  in any  meaningful  sense  exogenous  to  the  episode.
Individual  dispositions  and  attitudes  were  formed  and  transformed  through
an emphatically  social process.

As  with  George  Orwell's  "equal  animals"  of which  "some  animals  are

more  equal  than others,"'13 4 one heuristic is more  fundamental than  the rest-
at least in  social  contexts where  people,  lacking reliable  information  of their
own,  look to  others  for interpretations  of events.  In such  contexts,  informa-
tion  does not influence  individual perceptions  unless  it becomes  available  in
the  public  domain,  so  the availability  heuristic  necessarily  interacts  with all
the other  heuristics and  biases.  Insofar as people  exchange  information  with
one  another,  the  availability  of information  determines  the  characteristics  of
framing,  representativeness,  anchoring,  and  reference  points.  Likewise,

[Vol.  51:683

availability influences  perceptions  of the risk traits listed in Table I.  If public
discourse tends  to code  all pollution  as a loss relative  to an  imagined  state  of
environmental  purity,  that  imagined  state  will  become  the  reference  state,
and the  easy availability  of this coding  will influence  how individuals  frame
their judgments  about pollution.  In this manner the  availability heuristic  will
promote  frames  that trigger  loss  aversion.  Naturally,  no  loss  aversion  will
come  into play if public  discourse  emphasizes  the  environment's  cleanliness
relative  to  the past  or relative  to  another  society.  In  brief, the  availability
heuristic rules the roost.

Risk judgments  and preferences  are formed  through a circular social pro-
cess.  Identifiable social mechanisms govern the availability of information;
and  through  the  mediation  of  the  availability heuristic, this  availability
shapes, on  the  one  hand, judgments about the  magnitudes of various risks
and, on  the other, the acceptability of these risks.  Simultaneously, the con-
sequent individual actions and expressions affect the availability of informa-
tion.  There  are thus  two-way  interactions  between  social outcomes  and indi-
vidual  cognitive  processes.  These  interactions  form  an  availability cascade
whenever  individual  uses  of the  availability  heuristic  increase  the  public
availability  of data pointing  to  a particular  interpretation  or conclusion,  and
this increase in availability  then triggers reinforcing individual  responses.

In  contexts  subject  to  availability  cascades,  the  distribution  of beliefs
across the relevant  population may entail multiple  equilibria.  In other words,
the same  objective information  may  be capable  of sustaining  different,  even
extremely  different,  belief patterns,  depending  on  whether  a cascade  occurs
and,  if so, which  of many possible  cascades  is  initiated.  One risk may  gain
salience,  receive  an enormous  amount of attention,  and become  the  object of
tight regulation,  while another risk, which experts  deem equivalent,  is treated
as "part of normal life."

Against this background,  it is not surprising  that culturally  and economi-
cally similar nations  can display  dramatically  different  reactions  to  identical
risks.  While  nuclear  power  enjoys  widespread  acceptance  in  France,  it
arouses  considerable  fear  in  the  United  States. 135  Another  implication  of
multiple  equilibria  is  that  any  given  risk  assessment  may  change  suddenly
and  dramatically  even  in the  absence  of any  major  change  in  the  relevant

135.  Analogous  differences  are  observed  across  subgroups  within any  given  society.  Here  is
an example  of particular interest  to  legal  scholars  in the United States:  Casual empiricism  suggests
a  substantial  difference  between  law  students  at  the  University  of Chicago  and  those  at,  say, Co-
lumbia, Yale,  or Stanford  in their apparent  convictions  on  "hot  button"  political  issues.  Insofar  as
selection  bias is minimal  and  the students entering  these schools  are not significantly  different,  the
observed  opinion  differences  are  perhaps  a  product  of  availability  cascades.  On  certain  issues,
"liberal"  judgments  are  socially  "taxed"  at  Chicago  and  socially  "subsidized"  at  Columbia,  Yale,
and  Stanford, which  means  that they are  expressed  and heard  more commonly  at the latter three.  It
would be valuable to know whether  the differences  endure after graduation.

scientific  evidence. 13 6  Over  a short  time,  people  convinced  that their  envi-
ronment is perfectly livable may come  to think,  because  everyone  else  seems
to be getting  alarmed,  that it is replete with dreadful  carcinogens.  The  oppo-
site  transformation  is  also  possible.  Entire nations  may  become  convinced
that  their  environment  is  essentially  clean  along  one  dimension  or  another,
simply because  this judgment is widely shared. 137  And insofar as people  lack
independent  means  of judging  a  claim's  validity,  there  is  a  danger  that  the
beliefs  generated  by  a cascade  will  be factually  incorrect.  Millions  of indi-
viduals may  develop  erroneous  beliefs  simply  by  giving each  other reasons
to adopt  and preserve them.

Availability  cascades  do  not  appear  randomly.  For  one thing,  activists
choose  which dangers  to  stress publicly.  For another,  if an  availability  cas-
cade  is  to  unfold,  enough  people  must initially  be receptive  to  it.  Skillful
availability entrepreneurs  have insights into the sorts  of events to  which rele-
vant  segments  of society  are  receptive.  The  underlying  social  conditions
thus  create  what  one  might  call  an  availability market-a market  in  which
certain  risks  are  possible  foci  of cascades.  What  this  market  ultimately  se-
lects  will  obviously  change  over  time  and place.  In  late-twentieth-century
America,  the perceived  risks of nuclear power  are  far  more likely  to  trigger
an  alarmist  cascade than  those  from  sugar  consumption  (because  the  incon-
venience  of major change  is  obvious),  or lighting  candles  at the  dinner  table
(because  it is common knowledge  that people generally  rely on electricity  for
illumination).  Outside  of the  immediate  context  of risk  regulation,  a  claim
that pornography  constitutes  a  form of sex  discrimination was  more likely to
be taken  seriously  in  the  aftermath  of the  civil  rights  movement than  in  ear-
lier  times,  when  discrimination  did  not  enjoy  widespread  recognition  as  a
national problem.13s

The  concept of an availability  market  suggests the possibility  of compe-
tition among  availability  entrepreneurs.  Advocates  of putting  a  cap on puni-
tive damages  will point to  egregious  cases  of excess,  such  as the awarding  of
millions in  damages  because  of hot coffee  spilled on someone's arm  at a fast

136.  The general principle  here is that  small shocks  may produce disproportionately  large  re-
actions.  The principle  is developed  and demonstrated  in KuRAN,  supra note  5, at 247-348;  Kuran,
Now  Out of Never, supra note  3;  and  Kuran,  Sparks and Prairie Fires, supra note  3.  See  also
ARTHUR, supra note 6;  Bikhchandani  et al., A  Theory of Fads, supra note 3,  at 993.

137.  The underlying  belief formation  process  occurs  in  a vast  array  of domains.  AMARTYA
SEN,  COMMODITIES  AND  CAPABILITIES  (1985),  shows  that  Indian  widows  tend  to consider  them-
selves healthy  while  widowers  think of themselves  as relatively  unhealthy,  even  though by  objec-
tive medical  criteria  the latter group is far healthier than the former.  See id. at 81-83.  Although  part
of the explanation  is that widows  have  little experience  of feeling fit and  well-nourished,  inaccura-
cies  spread through  public discourse  play a key role.  For other examples of widely held mispercep-
tions,  see  the  chapters  on  "witch  mania"  and  "haunted  houses" 
in  CHARLES  MACKAY,
EXTRAORDINARY  POPULAR  DELUSIONS  AND  THE MADNESS  OF CROWDS  462-564,  593-618  (Har-
mony Books  1980) (1852).

food  restaurant;  opponents  of such  a  cap  will  refer  to  egregious  cases  of
wrongdoing  in  which  juries  awarded  relatively  modest  awards.  Critics  of
environmental  regulation  will point  to scares  that resulted  in massive  waste,
while advocates  will  highlight cases  in which the  nation responded too  little
too  late.  In  explaining  the  outcome  of such competition,  the capture  theory
of regulation invokes the  relative  strengths  of the competing  interest  groups,
as  measured,  for  instance,  by  capacity  to  raise  funds  and  deliver  votes. 139
Without  denying  that  relative  strengths  matter,  our  argument  stresses  that
these need not be decisive.  The objectively  weaker  side may triumph  simply
by exploiting  the right cognitive  biases,  timing its  campaigns  skillfully,  and
pressuring  the right  social  groups,  thereby  putting  in  motion  an  availability
cascade in its favor.  The side  that succeeds  in  triggering a  cascade favorable
to  its cause will then see the interdependent  responses  of ordinary individuals
make its advantages  grow explosively  and its initial political weaknesses  turn
into  irresistible  strengths.  After  the  cascade  has  run  its  course,  the  trium-
phant availability entrepreneurs  will appear to command  far greater resources
than  their defeated  opponents.  Yet  this  outcome  would  not have  been  pre-
dicted  at the  start.  In fact,  observers  might have predicted  the  opposite  out-
come.

We  shall distinguish between  two components  of an availability  cascade:
an  informational component  and  a  reputational component.  The  former
works through genuine  changes  in people's  beliefs.  If individuals  A,  B,  and
C become  convinced  that Love  Canal  is  spreading  cancer, D, upon learning
of this development,  might believe the  claim  on the  grounds  that her friends
cannot  all  be  wrong.  In believing  something  simply  because  many  others
consider  it true, D would be  compensating  for her  lack  of reliable  personal
information.  The  reputational  component  of an  availability  cascade  works
through expressions  of conviction,  weakly  or uncertainly  held, possibly even
feigned,  that  people  produce  in  order  to  retain  social  approval  and  escape
censure.  Imagine  that A  and B suggest that Love  Canal  is  dangerously  con-
taminated  and  that C, although  unconvinced  by  the claim,  refrains  from  ex-
pressing  his  misgivings  and  endorses  the  alarmist  position  simply  to  avoid
being  charged  with  stupidity  or  callousness.  In  this  illustration,  the  avail-
ability  of information  pointing to  Love  Canal's  danger rises  through misrep-
resentations  motivated by perceived  social pressures.

Extending  the  latter illustration,  suppose  that D comes  onto  the  scene,
finding that everyone  who has  spoken up about Love  Canal  appears  alarmed.
Unaware  that  one  of the statements  is  untruthful,  she  becomes  alarmed  her-
self, even though she  would have  felt secure  had she had access  to C's unex-

139.  For influential  variants of this  theory, see  Sam Peltzman,  Toward a More General The-

pressed  reservations. 140  This  extension  demonstrates  how  the  reputational
component  of an  availability  cascade  may  support  its  informational  compo-
nent.  Each  component  bolsters  the  availability  of information  pointing  to
serious  danger. 14 1  The  next  Part  will  develop  these  possibilities  in  greater
detail.

Ill.  AVAILABILITY  CASCADES

An  analysis  of any  mass  upheaval  that  triggers  political  and  legal  re-
sponses  to  perceived  risks  must  take  account  of two  sets  of  influences:
(1) social  influences  on the  individual,  and (2)  individual  influences  on soci-
ety.

The first set  consists  of the effects  that social variables  have  on personal
variables.  The  social  variable  of greatest  interest  here  is public discourse,
which is  the  ensemble  of publicly  expressed  or  conveyed  sentiments,  ideas,
and  information  that  individuals  use  as  gauges  of what  others  know  and
want.  Policy  initiatives  and  enactments,  including  steps  taken  by  official
agencies,  are  also relevant.  Public  discourse and other  social variables  influ-
ence three types  of personal  variables:  people's  risk judgments (perceptions
of the prevailing risks they  face), their  risk preferences (orderings of alterna-
tive  risks),  and  their  risk-policy  preferences,  or simply  their policy prefer-
ences (orderings  of possible  ways  of regulating risks).  The  second  set of in-
fluences  runs  the  opposite  way,  from  personal  variables  to  social  ones.  It
consists  of the  impact that individuals  have on public  discourse  through their
own personal transformations.

140.  Solomon  Asch's  famous  line experiment  uncovered  the potentially  immense behavioral
influence  of feigned judgments.  Asch's  subjects  were asked  to match the length of a line with  one
of three other lines,  two  of which were  obviously  of different length.  A  third of the subjects  gave
wrong  answers  in the  presence  of confederates  instructed  to  volunteer  unanimously  wrong  judg-
ments.  But the rate fell  to less than one percent  when one of Asch's confederates  deviated from  the
rest.  See S.E. Asch,  Effects  of Group Pressure upon the Modification and Distortion of Judgments,
in GROUPs,  LEADERSHIP  AND  MEN  177  (Harold  Guetzkow  ed.,  1951).  For  interpretations  of the
line  experiment  and  many  related  experiments,  see  KURAN,  supra note  5,  at 22-44;  and  ELLIOTT
ARONSON,  THE SOCIAL ANIMAL  20-28 (7th ed.  1995).

141.  It is possible,  however, for the two components  to work at cross-purposes.  Suppose now
that A,  B,  and  C express  alarm  over  Love  Canal  while D, a prominent  newspaper  columnist,  sug-
gests  that worries  are  unjustified.  E believes  the  alarmist  claim  on  the grounds  that  most people
seem alarmed,  and  he communicates  his  new worry without  equivocation.  For her part, F,  though
convinced  of the dominant  view, pretends  to be undisturbed for fear of annoying  the columnist, who
has  the  power  to  damage  her  career. 
In  this  illustration,  the  actions  of E  and  F  work  at  cross-
purposes  with  respect  to  availability.  The  informationally  driven worries  of E make  alarmist data
more  available,  but the reputationally  driven  apparent  tranquility  of F make  it  less  available.  Ac-
cordingly,  E's reaction  helps the availability  cascade  move  forward  while  that  ofF slows  it down.
Depending  on the circumstances, the net effect  may be to make  most members of society dismiss an
actually grave  risk.

[Vol. 51:683

The two sets of influences  thus form  a circular process.  Public discourse
shapes  individual  risk judgments,  risk  preferences,  and  policy  preferences;
and the  reshaped  personal  variables  then transform  the public  discourse  that
contributed  to their own transformations.

In  ordinary  language,  the  term  "public"  is  employed  to  connote  both
openness and collectiveness.  It is the  former sense that is relevant here.  Un-
like  a  "private"  variable,  a  public  variable  is  one  that  is  generally  visible.
Strictly  speaking,  a  private  characteristic,  such  as  a  private perception  of a
chemical spill's risk, is known only to  its bearer, although people  close  to the
individual,  including  his  relatives  and  close  friends, may  have  good  insight
into  what  he  is  thinking  and  feeling.  Because  of its visibility,  the  transfor-
mation  of a public  variable  can have  sudden  and direct  effects  on  individual
thoughts and dispositions.  If a newspaper  report suggests that a water supply
is  safe, thousands of readers  may instantly feel reassured.

By  contrast,  the  immediate  effects  of private  variables  are  necessarily
limited,  although,  as  we  shall  see,  they  can  have  important  effects  over
longer  time  spans,  through  less  direct  channels.  If an  official  investigates
scientific  reports  about  a waste  dump  and  becomes  convinced  that  worries
are  unjustified,  this knowledge  itself will  have no impact  on the information
available  to  alarmed  residents.  What will  influence  the perceptions  of resi-
dents  is  what  he  says  publicly.  It  is  critical  to  recognize  that  the  official's
public  pronouncements  are manipulable.  Indeed,  they  can  diverge  from the
thoughts that he carries  within his head  and from the  knowledge  he conveys
to  a  confidant.  To  avoid  charges  of insensitivity,  even  to  avoid  having  to
justify an  unpopular position,  he may  make  speeches  and promote  policies
that  convey  deep  concern  about  a  waste  spill  that  he  actually  considers
harmless.

Just  as  an  official  may  tailor  his  public  pronouncements  to  protect  his
reputation,  so,  too, may  the  other  individuals  who  contribute  to public  dis-
course  and public  activity.  Let us  distinguish,  therefore, between  the private
and public  variants  of the  variables  that  characterize  individuals.  A  given
resident  of Love  Canal  has a private risk judgment and also  a  corresponding
public risk judgment. Depending  on the reputational  costs  and benefits asso-
ciated with alternative public  acts  and  expressions,  the  latter may  differ from
the former.  In particular,  the  resident may  convey  an  interpretation  that un-
der- or overstates  what  she would  express  privately.  Likewise,  in any given
context  the resident's private risk preference and private policy preference
may  differ  from  her  corresponding public risk preference and public policy
preference.  Whenever  she  chooses  to  express  different  preferences  from
those  that  she  holds  in her  own mind,  she  engages  in a  form  of preference

A  VAILABILITY  CASCADES

falsification.  And by  misrepresenting  her  risk judgment  in  public,  she  en-
gages in a form of knowledge  falsification. 142

The  distinction  between  private  and  public  variables  calls  for  a  refine-
ment to the  circular process  described  above.  People's public judgments  and
preferences  influence  both the private  and the public  variables  of other indi-
viduals.  But the mechanisms  are  separate.  In the  former case,  the influence
rests  on  the  informational  value  of public  words  and  deeds;  in  the  latter, it
works through the  generated reputational  costs  and benefits.  As with any bi-
directional  relationship,  one  gains  analytical  clarity by focusing  on  each  in-
ference  separately.  We  shall  start  with  the  transformation  of private  vari-
ables under  the influence  of public  variables, then  move onto  the reverse  in-
fluence.  These  analytical  steps  will  prepare  us  for  a  fuller  description  of
availability cascades,  including  the efforts that perceptive  individuals  under-
take  to exploit them.

A.  The Social Construction of Risk Judgments and Preferences

Because  it is costly.to  gather pertinent information, individuals  ordinarily
seek  to  free  ride  on  knowledge  that  is  publicly  available  through  sources
ranging  from  gossip  and  rumors  to  scientific  reports.  Most  risk judgments
rest  on  little,  if  any,  personal  investigation;  they  depend  largely,  if not
wholly,  on  trust placed  in  the judgments  of selected  others.  Consider  Bar-
bara  Quimby,  the  Love  Canal  resident  who  sobbed  before  television  cam-
eras. 143  Quimby  had not analyzed  water  samples or  studied their impurities.

142.  The  concepts  of preference  and  knowledge  falsification  are  developed  in KURAN,  supra
note  5.  Carrying  no  normative  significance  in and  of themselves,  these  terms  connote  only  that
impressions  conveyed  in  public differ  from  those  held  or expressed  privately. 
It is  obvious  that
society will  often  benefit  from knowledge  falsification,  as when  an  ignorant person,  afraid of mak-
ing  a fool  of himself, "goes  with  the  flow"  in a  meeting  dominated  by  well-trained  professionals.
Likewise,  preference  falsification  may  produce  socially  felicitous  outcomes  when  the  preference
being  falsified  is invidious  (e.g., sadism),  when it produces  policy outcomes  that give  rise to bene-
fits unexpected  by the falsifiers  themselves,  or when  it allows  people with more intense feelings  to
fulfill  their  goals.  Preference  falsification  also  can help  resolve  internal  conflict,  a  common  phe-
nomenon.  Consider  a  person  whose conscience  instructs  him  to  contribute  to  a  charitable  cause
while  his selfish  side insists  that the money  is needed  instead  for his planned  cruise.  And suppose
that  in making  financial  decisions  in the privacy of his home  this  individual  caves  in  to his  selfish
impulses  and  refrains  from  responding  to  the  charity's  appeal.  Subsequently,  at  a  social  event
where  an  appeal  for  money  is  made,  he  feels  pressured  to  make  a  donation.  Readers  of various
political persuasions  will  find  this person's  public preference  more appealing  than his  private pref-
erence.  In fact, even  the individual  himself may wish that  in private he  was  able  to muster  the will
to  act as he would  in the  presence of others.  It could be that his private preference  affects  his  self-
conception  negatively  while his public preference  affects  it positively.  For more on the latter point,
see  Timur  Kuran,  Moral  Overload  and  Its  Alleviation,  in  ECONOMICS,  VALUES,  AND
ORGANIZATION  231  (Avner  Ben-Ner  & Louis  Putterman  eds.,  1998);  Lessig,  supra note  13;  and
Cass  R. Sunstein, Social Norms and Social Roles, 96  COLUM.  L.  REv.  903  (1996).  While the latter
observation  points to the complexity of individual preferences and  choices,  in no way  does it nullify
the social significance  of reputationally driven efforts to manage one's public image.

[Vol.  51:683

Her  fears  were  based  entirely  on  the  apparent  perceptions  of her  acquain-
tances  and reports in the  mass media.144  That a belief is  a product  of social
influences  does  not  mean  that  it  is  weakly  held,  or  superficial  from  the
standpoint  of its  holder;  on the  contrary, it may run  very deep.  The resident
of a contaminated  area may  be entirely  convinced that the  pollution will  kill
anyone  who  stays  in the  area,  even  though her  information  comes  from sta-
tistics,  claims, and interpretations  that she has  done nothing to verify.

Most, though not all,1 45  personal risk judgments  stem primarily  from  so-
cial influences  rather than hardwiring.  If most Americans  consider industrial
waste dumps to  pose much greater  dangers  to themselves  than the millions  of
deer  that  roam  the  nation's  highways,  the  reason  lies  in  public  discourse,
notably the content  of the mass media.  Whereas the  electronic  and print me-
dia  are  replete  with  reports  of industrial  waste  dumps,  they  seldom  pay at-
tention to the traffic  injuries and deaths  caused by deer herds that have grown
fifty-four-fold  since  the  1940s  because  of  hunting  restrictions,  lack  of
predators, and abundant new habitat. 146  As a consequence, many people who
consider  environmental  contamination  an  omnipresent  and  devastating  dan-
ger  think  of deer  as  the affectionate,  harmless,  and  vulnerable  animals  por-
trayed by Walt Disney's moving fable Bambi.

A  complicating  factor  is  that  communities  typically  harbor  subcommu-
nities  whose members  interact primarily  among themselves.  Depending  on
the  context,  a  given  subcommunity  may  discount,  even  ignore,  information
provided  by  outsiders.  That  the  media  as  a whole  are  bombarding  society
with  one  particular  interpretation  of an  event  provides  no  guarantee,  then,
that  every  segment  of society  will  take  notice.  Insofar  as  subcommunities
live in isolation  from the  rest of society,  the  reach of an  availability  cascade
will be limited.  Yet  subcommunities  that resist a particular  availability  cas-
cade  may  themselves  produce  internal,  smaller-scale,  local availability cas-
cades.  The  very processes  that we are  outlining may  account  for the  spread
and  persistence  of views  within  subcommunities.  And  in principle,  there-
fore,  the private risk judgments  within  a given  subcommunity may  lie closer
to the truth, however we choose to define it, than  those dominant outside it.

Private risk judgments and risk preferences  also  have pre-social  determi-
nants.  For example,  most people  are  predisposed  to  fear  snakes  but not vi-

144.  See id.
145.  See  DAMASIO,  supra note 2,  at 131-34.  A person who  encounters  a leopard  will sense  a
grave  danger  even  if  no one  else  seems alarmed.  We  all  are  hardwired  to fear  large,  moving  ob-
jects.

146.  In  the  mid-1990s,  there  were  more  deer  in  the  United  States  than  when  the  Pilgrims
landed  in  1620.  See  Editorial, Bambi the Pest, N.Y.  TIMES,  July  26,  1997,  at 20.  In 1996  alone,
100 people died  and many  more were seriously  injured in 500,000  automobile collisions with deer.

ruses. 147  In  the  absence  of social  influences,  they  will  take  greater  precau-
tions against snakes that happen  to be harmless than  against potentially  lethal
health hazards. 148  Nonetheless,  even in such contexts  socialization  can make
a  huge  difference.  We  can  be  educated,  for  example,  to  feel  comfortable
around  reptiles.  Likewise,  we  can  learn  to  consider  certain risks  less  toler-
able than others  that pose equivalent,  if not greater, risks.  We  may learn,  on
the  one hand,  that it is  unconscionable  to  allow  deaths  from  waste  sites  that
are  by-products  of our  material  prosperity,  and  on  the  other,  that  fatalities
from  collisions  with  deer  are  the  sad  but  acceptable  consequence  of tres-
passing through deer  country.149  Such learning  conditions  us to become less
tolerant toward risks associated  with industrial  wastes than toward equivalent
risks posed by deer.

All  sources  of basic  socialization-parental  upbringing,  formal  educa-
tion,  and culture--contribute  to  the  formation  of private risk judgments  and
risk preferences.  For the  purposes at hand, however, these influences  can be
treated  as part of a  fixed  background.  The  availability  cascades  of greatest
interest  here  run  their  course  over periods  too  short  for  them  to  change  ap-
preciably.  Especially  relevant  to  the  present  discussion  are  the  activities  of
the mass media.  Media  outlets have diverse  and complex  objectives,  but it is
clear  that  most newspapers,  magazines,  and  television  stations  seek  to  en-
large their  "audience."'' 0  It is  also  clear that this  goal generally  causes them
to  emphasize  dangers  over  security, give some risks more exposure  than oth-
ers,  and treat  certain  risks  as particularly  serious.  The media  exercise  these
influences  by  controlling  the  prominence  with which  stories  are  pursued, by
selecting,  soliciting,  and  shaping  the  quotations  used  in  developing  sto-
rylines,  and  by  selecting  the  facts  reported  to  advance  editorial  purposes,
among other mechanisms.' 5 l

To  be sure,  the  media,  especially  the  print media,  feature  various  opin-
ions  on many issues, and on matters  of risk they  alone  cannot account  for an
observed  homogenization  of individual  knowledge  or dispositions.  But  the
diversity  of opinion can be illusory because  the  editors  of media outlets  typi-

149.  There is  a  growing  literature  that tends  to  treat humans  as  abusers  of the  environment,
including  plants and  animals,  and  denies  individuals  the moral authority  to harm,  or even  regulate,
anything natural.  See, e.g., PETER SINGER,  PRACTICAL  ETHICS  16-109,  264-88 (2d ed.  1993).

cally select commentators  to  construct  a  truncated  distribution of views cen-
tered  on policy positions of their own.152  During the  Love Canal episode,  the
media  did  indeed  exhibit differences  over the  best response.  But the "mod-
erate"  commentaries-those  at  the  ideological  center-favored  a  massive
cleanup,  with  most other  opinions  differing  essentially  in  the  details.  And
despite  the appearance  of open-ended  debate,  some risks  may receive  enor-
mous  attention, while  others are neglected.  The biases of any one newspaper
may not matter, of course,  if they are offset by  opposite biases  of other media
outlets.  But in the  course  of an availability  cascade,  one  particular bias will
spread across the media and grow.

Private  risk judgments  and preferences  shape  the  corresponding  private
policy  preferences,  the  orderings  over  alternative  policy  options  that people
privately  favor.  The  greater  the  dangers  individuals  ascribe  to  industrial
waste  dumps,  with  all  else  constant,  the  more  they  will  favor  expenditures
for  cleanups.  By  the  same  token,  the  more  intolerant  they  are  of industrial
pollution,  again  with  all else  constant, the  more  they will  favor  such  expen-
ditures.  In sum, social  influences  shape  the private policy preferences  of in-
dividuals  through  two  complementary  channels:  by  shaping  their  percep-
tions  of risks  and by molding their  attitudes toward sources  of risk.

B.  Informational Cascades

For the  moment, let  us abstract from  the  social pressures  that cause peo-
ple's  private characteristics  to  diverge  from  their public  characteristics.  As
an  analytical  step,  we  are  thus  assuming  that no  differences  exist  between
private  and  public  risk judgments,  between  private  and  public  risk  prefer-
ences,  or between private and public policy preferences.  Against this simpli-
fied background, consider the members  of a  society debating  how to respond,
if at  all, to  a toxic  spill.  As  individuals,  they  all want to  know what will be
best for  themselves,  their families,  and their  communities.  Generally,  how-
ever,  they  will  devote  little  time  to  examining  the  scientific  evidence  be-
cause,  if nothing  else,  they would not know how  to  interpret  such data  with-
out  extensive  study.  Most of the  community's  members  will form their pri-
vate  risk judgments,  risk  preferences,  and  policy  preferences  through  very
limited  information.  Moreover,  the acquisition  and processing of the  readily
available  information  will be shaped  by one  or more  cognitive  heuristics that
economize  on both  mental  effort  and  time.  Suppose  that large  segments  of
the  media  are  comparing  the  source  of contamination  to  leaded  gasoline,
which  was  banned  after  a  cost-benefit  study showed  it to be  a highly  toxic

Individuals  exposed  to  the  media  are  more  likely,  holding  all
else  fixed,  to  consider  the  contamination  as  representative  of  high-risk
chemicals,  with all the associations  that follow.  The key precondition  for  an
erroneous  informational  cascade  is  thus that most citizens have little reliable
information of their own about the claim in question.

Similarly,  if the  media begin  touting  tough new industrial regulations  to
prevent  future  waste  leakages,  with little  attention  to  the  downside,  citizens
will become  sensitized  to  the benefits  of tougher  controls,  without necessar-
ily developing  an awareness  of the  costs.15 4  The point  is  critical,  for people
display  much  less  eagerness  to  obtain  particular  benefits  when  they  gain
awareness  of the corresponding  costs.  Widely reported  evidence  of the  risks
associated  with  x-rays  and  automobile  driving  have  generated  limited  be-
havioral  responses  because  the  huge  costs  of giving up  these  amenities  are
self-evident.' 55  In cases where  the costs  are not as clear, the content  of media
coverage  may  have  major  consequences  for people's  understanding,  by  de-
termining  the  relative  availability  of both  the  relevant  data  and  their  inter-
pretation.  Insofar as  the availability  heuristic  shapes people's  interpretations
and  desired  policy  responses,  the  media  may  lead  people  to  exaggerate  the
dangers  of the  situation  at  hand,  convince  them  that  its  elimination  should
receive  priority,  and make  them  discount the  inconveniences  that would  ac-
company  an  elimination  attempt.  The  opposite  effects  are  possible  too;
through neglect the media may breed ignorance  about a genuine  danger, thus
dampening the  demand for action.

A  strictly  informational  cascade  occurs  when  people  start  attaching
credibility  to  a proposition P  (e.g.,  a  certain  abandoned  waste  dump is  dan-
gerous)  merely  because  other people  seem  to  accept P.  To  recast  an  earlier
illustration,  suppose that Ames  signals  that he believes  P.  Barr,  who would
otherwise  have  major reservations,  believes  P  because  Ames  appears  to  do
so.  Cotton, who would  have dismissed  the proposition  as silly, begins  taking
it seriously upon  discovering  that not just Ames  but both he and Barr are  be-
lievers.  Noticing  that  Ames,  Barr,  and  Cotton  all seem  alarmed,  Douglas
then  accepts  P  without  further  thought.  When  Entin  learns  that  all  of his
friends  believe  P,  he joins  the  pack  of believers  on  the  grounds  that  their
shared understanding  cannot be wrong. 5 6

Ordinarily,  individuals  differ  in  their  preconceptions,  the  reliability  of
their personal  sources  of information,  their  openness to public  discourse,  and

their sensitivity to  changes  in  the  apparent  views  of others.15 7  These  differ-
ences  fulfill a further precondition  of any  cascade:  heterogeneity in individ-
ual responsiveness to social signals.  In the  absence  of variations,  everyone
would  adjust  simultaneously  to  new information,  producing not  an informa-
tional  cascade  but  a  sudden  collective  shift by  independent  actors.  With  a
cascade,  adjustments  come  at different  times,  with  some individuals  becom-
ing  convinced  of a  serious  danger  at  the  earliest  sign  of adverse  health  ef-
fects,  but others  remaining  skeptical  to varying  degrees  until more informa-
tion becomes  available.158  This is an important  part of the  process that drove
the  three  episodes  discussed  above,  though,  as  we  shall  see,  not the  whole
story.  In  each  of those  cases  many  people  lacked  the  means  to  form  their
own judgments,  so  they came to  consider  the alleged problem  serious by ac-
cepting the dominant  opinion.  In the  course  of an informational  cascade,  the
perceived  validity  of a  claim  grows  progressively  stronger  with  the number
of apparent believers,  and people's  doubts weaken,  possibly  even disappear.
In  accepting  a  belief,  each  individual  strengthens  the  case  for  acceptance,
which  results  in  additional  acceptances  that  strengthen  the  case  even  fur-
ther.159  The  ultimate  outcome  can  be  a  widely  shared  judgment  based  on
little information.  Although commonly held, the judgment  can also  be quite
fragile,  in the  sense  that it may  shift as  a result  of small  shocks.  This  is  so
precisely because it is based on little information.1 60

To  be sure, this stylized  logic  oversimplifies  the way that most individu-
als interpret public  claims.  Numbers  alone  do not give information  validity.
Among  the other influential factors  is credibility.  If one hundred people  are
denying  that the contamination  of Love  Canal  poses a  danger to  human be-
ings,  and  a  spokesperson  for the  National  Association  of Chemical  Manu-
facturers joins  the chorus  by releasing  data  consistent  with the  claim,  most
listeners  will  discount  the  data  on  the  ground  that  his  association  has  an
enormous  stake  in making  the  contamination  seem  trivial.  His  statements
might  even  kindle  suspicions  of a  cover-up,  making  listeners  more,  rather
than  less,  receptive  to  evidence  of serious  danger.1 61  In  any  case,  people's
preconceptions  make  them exhibit  selective trust and mistrust.  Some people
are  skeptical  of governmental  claims  about risk;  others think that  if a corpo-

157.  Part of the reason  is  that the brain's circuitry  at any  given moment  reflects  each individ-

ual's unique  history and circumstances.  See DAMASIO, supra note 2, at 260.

158.  While  a necessary  condition,  heterogeneity is  not a sufficient condition:  Certain  forms
of heterogeneity  will  inhibit rather  than  facilitate  a cascade.  Suppose that  the members  of a com-
munity  have  such  different  preconceptions  about  a  potential  danger  that  each  treats  the  conveyed
judgments  of others as irrelevant.  Under this  condition, fears that individuals  develop on account of
their own experiences will  not be contagious.

ration  makes  a  claim  the  opposite  must  be true;  still  others  are  inclined  to
believe  that  environmental  lobbies  are  in the  business  of creating  unneces-
Individuals  who  trust  one  set  of actors  will  sometimes  mis-
sary  "scares." 
trust another set, and almost any large population will  contain a great  deal of
diversity  on  this  front.  Consequently,  informational  cascades  generated  by
the  availability heuristic  may operate like wildfire  within  one  subgroup  with-
out spreading within  another.  It follows  that at any  given time different  sub-
groups  may  experience  their  own  informational  cascades.  One  subgroup
may come  to agree  that the  idea of global warming is a fraud, another that all
pesticides  pose  a grave  health hazard,  still another that  the U.S.  government
engineered  the  AIDS  crisis,  or even  invented  the  AIDS  virus, to  destroy  an
ethnic  minority.

Like  the  communicator's  trustworthiness,  the  risk traits  listed in Table  I
may  affect  the  impact  of any  given  communication.  For example,  a report
that points  to  a  familiar  problem  such  as  industrial  pollution  will  ordinarily
be more credible than  one  that draws  attention  to  an unfamiliar problem,  for
example,  the  hazards  of breathing  the  air  of used  book  shops.  As  a  rule,
however, the  greater  the number  of people  who hold  a particular  interpreta-
tion of reality,  the stronger is the perceived  validity of that interpretation. 162

C.  The Distortion of Public Discourse Through Social Pressures

By  abstracting  from  social  pressures,  the  previous  Part  disregarded  the
possibility that people  will misrepresent  their thoughts in order  to accommo-
date  the  perceived  agendas  of others.  But  only  rarely  are  social  pressures
negligible,  and purely informational  cascades  are  the  exception  rather  than
the rule.

162.  In fact, the numbers in  question need not refer to an aggregate  consisting of separate in-
dividuals.  Psychologists  have  shown  that mere repetition  can enhance  the perceived  validity  of an
interpretation.  In other  words,  restatements  of a  single individual's  risk judgment may  substitute
for another individual's  endorsement of that judgment.  So  it is  that political  candidates repeat  the
same  slogans  ad  nauseam,  hoping to  raise  the popularity  of their  positions  by  making their  audi-
ences  hear  them  repeatedly.  Even  in  academic  scholarship,  arguments  gain  validity  by  force  of
repetition.  The  informational  value  of repetition  is  itself rooted  in  the availability  heuristic.  The
more a person is exposed to a view, the  easier its  retrieval  from memory  and,  hence, the less doubt-
ful  it appears.  See generally KURAN,  supra note 5,  at 157-75 (elaborating  on this  concept in greater
detail);  ANTHONY  PRATKANIS  & ELLIOT  ARONSON,  AGE  OF PROPAGANDA:  THE EVERYDAY  USE
AND  ABUSE  OF PERSUASION  134-39  (1992)  (examining  the use of the same advertisements  repeti-
tively).  For experimental  confirmation,  see,  for example, Lynn Hasher, David  Goldstein & Thomas

1.  Expressive distortions.

In  practice,  each public  signal  or communication  will differ  from its pri-
vate  counterpart  insofar  as  people  seek  to  protect  or  improve  their  social
standing  through preference  and knowledge  falsification.  Depending  on the
apparent  social pressures,  a group  of officials  may  endorse reports  that Love
Canal  poses  a huge  threat  to  nearby residents,  when  they know  of data  that
make  the  reports  suspect;  and  they may  feign  approval  of a relocation  plan
even  though  they  consider  the  step  ludicrous.  The  first  case  of insincerity
constitutes a case  of knowledge  falsification.  It signals to  others  an  exagger-
ated  risk judgment,  one  that  inflates  the  corresponding  private  perception.
The  second  act  provides  a  case  of preference  falsification,  as  it makes  the
support  for  relocation  greater  than  one  would  find  if officials  were  polled
through  a  secret  ballot.  Simply  because  of reputational  incentives  people
may  echo  a  popular  sentiment,  even  though  they  have  not  made  up  their
minds  and feel  confused,  or a popular judgment, even though they  are  clue-
less about its veracity.  Plainly, all such forms of falsification  were present in
the Love Canal episode.

Knowledge  and  preference  falsification  are  common  because  people
want  to  be  regarded  and  treated  well  and,  equally  important,  this  desire  is
common  knowledge.  These  conditions  provide  individuals  and  groups  op-
portunities  to  advance  their agendas  merely  by expressing  approval  of their
public  supporters and  disapproval  of their public  opponents.  The  granting  of
approval  operates  as  a  "subsidy"  to  supporters  and that  of disapproval  as  a
"tax"  on  opponents.  Insofar  as  some  individuals'  need  for  social  approval
outstrips  their  other  needs-more  precisely,  "reputational  utility"'163  looms
large  in  total  utility-they  will  tailor  their  expressed  beliefs  and  conveyed
dispositions  to  their  audiences.  A  related  means  of  earning  the  affection,
support, and goodwill  of a group  is to  help punish its  enemies  and reward its
friends.  Accordingly,  a  common  form  of  preference  falsification  entails
criticizing  people  whose  expressions  one  likes,  or  at  least  does  not dislike.
For instance,  a New Yorker aware  of the  lack of alarming  scientific evidence
may, in the interest  of bolstering  her reputation,  intimate that an official who
counsels  calm  should  be  removed  from  office  for  displaying  lamentable
"weakness  on  the  environment."  Through  such  actions,  preference  and
knowledge  falsification  contribute  to  the  very  social  pressures  that produce
and reproduce  them.

Preference  and knowledge  falsification  are sometimes  undertaken merely
to  avoid  having  to  explain  oneself to  an  audience.  If almost  everyone  ap-
pears  to consider  Love  Canal  a  "killing ground,"  the few  who  counsel  inac-
tion  will  be  expected  to  justify  their  expressed  preferences  at  length.  By

of utility,  see KURAN, supra note 5, at 22-44.

contrast, those  who endorse  a state  of emergency  will not be required  to  ex-
plain  themselves.  Because  the  burden  of proof falls  on themselves,  skeptics
may  choose to  keep quiet, or even  to join the dominant  chorus,  simply to  be
left alone.  Thus a precondition  of a reputational  cascade is  widespread will-
ingness to  make behavioral or expressive adjustments in the  interest of im-
proving one's standing.

2.  Depth and width of a public consensus.

The  social  pressures  created  by  sincere  and  insincere  expressions reflect
more  than the  sum  of communicated  preferences.  All else  equal,  a rich per-
son's public preference  will  impose more pressure  than that of a poor person,
because  the  former  possesses  more  effective  means  to  tax  and  subsidize.
Likewise,  the  preference  of a  high  bureaucrat  will  generally  impose  more
pressure  than  that of a lowly  clerk,  because  the  former commands  a  greater
capacity  to  confer or deny  favors.16  Another relevant  factor  is the  apparent
"depth"  of the communicated  preference.  For example,  if five people  insist,
with  great  confidence  and  intensity,  that  failure  to  recycle  one's  aluminum
cans  constitutes  a horrible  crime  against  future  generations,  their statements
may exert  greater pressure  than the  mild  concerns  expressed  by  fifty  others.
By  the  same  token,  when  five  million  people  seem  to  believe  a particular
proposition, the very  "width" of the belief will impose pressure.

From  the  individual's  point  of view,  then, both the  depth  and  the  width
of publicly  conveyed  convictions  are relevant.  A  wide  and  apparently  deep
public  consensus  will create  enormous reputational  pressure,  and it may also
provide  considerable  information  about  the  underlying  private  preferences.
By  contrast,  a wide  but shallow  public  consensus  will  impose modest  pres-
sure that private  dissenters  are likely to find easy to resist publicly, and it will
generate  less information about private preferences.

3.  Social subdivisions and other complexities.

In  actual  societies,  people  face  diverse  audiences,  not  a  single,  mono-
lithic  audience  whose  members  all tune  in  at the  same  time.  To  the  extent
that their  audiences  are  separated  from one  another,  they may vary  their ex-
pressions  from one  to the next.  Having  endorsed a relocation  decision before
one  audience,  they may dodge  the issue before  another,  and criticize the step
before yet another.  Such shifts  in behavior  are  typically  associated  with po-
liteness.  In the  unusually  sensitive  social  domain  of race  relations,  research-
ers  find  that many  Americans  of all  backgrounds  formulate  their  interview

164.  In  addition, the more powerful  person might be  presumed to know  more, by virtue of his

professional  success.

[Vol. 51:683

responses  differently,  depending  on  the  interviewer's  perceived  race.165  A
related  study  shows that when  asked to provide  feedback to fellow  students,
many white  students  are relatively  less  critical of essays they believe to  have
been  written  by blacks  than  of those  they  believe  to  have  been  written  by
whites.1 66  Although  several  motives  could  be at  work here,  one  is  to  avoid
being judged hostile  to  blacks.  The bias in question  disappears  and in  some
cases  is  reversed  when  evaluations  are  taken in  settings  that  rule  out  cross-
racial  communication. 167  These  findings  suggest  that  when  a  person  ex-
presses  different  judgments  or preferences  before  two  separate  audiences,
both sets  of expressions  could be  insincere.  A graduate  student asked  about
her opinions  concerning  a  toxic  spill could  downplay  what  she  considers to
be  the  true  danger  before  her  skeptical  advisors  and  then  inflate  the  same
danger before hungry reporters  looking for a scientist to  showcase  as a para-
gon of incompetence. I68

Another complexity  is that conformism,  insofar as it is  driven by the  de-
sire to be  accepted  and liked,  often  competes  with  the  impulse  to  stand  out
and apart from the  crowd, gain recognition,  and  (what is not the  same thing)
be  oneself.  Some people  refrain  from preference  or knowledge  falsification
even when they  thereby hurt their popularity.  In addition,  some  people  per-
ceive general public opprobrium  a  subsidy rather than a tax,  especially when
it  is  accompanied  by  widespread  approval,  perhaps  even  a  leadership  role,
within  a  dissident  subcommunity. 169  As  we  shall  see,  the  boundaries  of ac-
ceptable nonconformism  can change through  an availability cascade.

Both belief and preference  falsification are  matters  of degree.  The  most
extreme  form is to assert exactly the opposite of what one thinks  or wants, as

169.  Such people  avoid  challenging  norms  of their  subcommunities,  lest  they  be  excluded
from  them.  The idea  that certain  forms of nonconformism  serve as  marks  of individual  distinction
within  particular  subcultures  lies  at the  heart  of Thorstein  Veblen's  examination  of "conspicuous
consumption."  See  his  classic  work, THORSTEIN  VEBLEN,  THE  THEORY  OF THE  LEISURE  CLASS:

ment, which focuses  on modem  countercultural movements  ranging from rock-and-roll hedonists  to

when a  scientist convinced  of the  safety  of Alar-treated  apples  pretends  that
they  threaten  children  and  expresses  support  for banning  the  production  of
Alar.  Weaker forms  include  the  suppression  of doubt  about  a report's  accu-
racy,  the exaggeration  of enthusiasm  for a policy,  and miscommunication  of
mild concern  as intense fear, or vice versa.  However,  even such weak forms
of falsification  distort the  content  of public  discourse.  They  do  so by trans-
forming both the  substance  of knowledge  in  the public  domain  and the  social
pressures  that  determine  what is  and is  not acceptable  to  communicate  pub-
licly.

4.  Reputational insurance.

The  pressures  that promote  untruthful  expression  need not be palpable  at
the time  of an  individual's  expressive  decision.  Sometimes  we refrain  from
speaking  our minds in  anticipation  of social  pressures  for which no  concrete
evidence yet  exists.  For example,  an official  who considers  a waste  spill in-
nocuous may shade her knowledge  simply to avoid being perceived as "weak
on  the  environment"  in  the  event  that  the  spill  comes  to  be  perceived  as
harmful.  By  falsifying  her  knowledge  she  buys  reputational insurance, a
measure  of immunity  against possible pressures  from  environmentalists.  She
also  pays a price, of course, by forfeiting  the opportunity to  be known  as one
of the  first officials  to diagnose  the spill correctly.

D.  Reputational Cascades

We have  already touched on the origins  of the  social pressures that create
incentives  for  tailoring  one's  public  expressions  to  social  expectations.
Where policies  will create  winners  and losers,  not everyone  simply  reacts  to
pressures.  Ever alert to  the mechanisms under  consideration,  some individu-
als  take  it upon  themselves  to  shape  the  pressures  in  order  to  mold  public
discourse  and  control  the  policy selection  process.  Examples  of such  avail-
ability entrepreneurs  include Lois Marie Gibbs in the case  of Love Canal  and
members  of the  NRDC  in  the Alar case.  Availability  entrepreneurs  actively
encourage  the statement  of views  favorable  to  these  options  and  discourage
the  statement  of unfavorable  views.  A precondition  for  a reputational  cas-
cade is  thus  the possibility  of inducing  splits  between  the  private and public
"selves"  of a sufficient number  of people.  Such a split requires  a willingness
on the part  of many  citizens to  shade  their public  expressions  and tailor their
public  actions in the interest of protecting  their social standing.

Once  initiated by  groups  with  a  financial  or  ideological  stake  in policy
control,  social  pressures  may  grow  through  the  assistance  of  the  broader
population.  For this  reason,  such  groups  confer  reputational  benefits  on  in-
dividuals who  support  particular  positions  and  impose reputational  costs  on

those  who  oppose  them.  They  make  individuals  seem  altruistic  or  selfish,

People ordinarily  want to be perceived  as standing  on high moral ground,  so
in the presence  of sufficiently  strong pressures, they  adjust  their expressions
accordingly.  Suppose  that  questioning  the  wisdom  of relocating  the  Love
Canal  residents  is  generally  equated  with  obtuseness  and  cold-heartedness,
is  construed  as  giving  anti-
and  calling  for  further  scientific  study 
environmentalist  firms time  to  develop  their defenses.  Under these  circum-
stances,  residents,  observers,  and  policy  makers  will  all think  twice  before
expressing  misgivings about the  dominant diagnoses  or policies.

Earlier,  in  discussing  informational  cascades,  we  performed  a  thought
experiment  that abstracted  from social  pressures  and, hence,  the reputational
consequences  of people's  expressive  choices. 170  Going  to the  opposite  ex-
treme,  let  us now  suppose that the  choices  of individuals  are  driven entirely
by  efforts  to protect  their  social  standing.  We  are  thus  imagining  that peo-
ple's private judgments and preferences  play no role at  all in their expressive
choices;  like  puppets  under  a  puppeteer's  command,  people  express  them-
selves  simply  to  accommodate  social  pressures.  If  everyone  was  equally
aware  of the  prevailing  social  pressures,  interpreted  threats  and  promises
identically,  and  cared  equally  about  maintaining  a  good  reputation,  they
would do so  in unison at the  first hint that someone wanted them to support a
particular agenda.  In reality,  all such factors  vary  across individuals.  People
differ, for instance,  in the  attention they pay to the news, the circles  in which
they  move,  the  experiences  they  have  had  with taking  unpopular  positions,
and the  importance  they  attach to being  admired  and  accepted.  Such differ-
ences guarantee  variations  in responsiveness  to social pressure.

Imagine,  then,  that when  a  waste  spill is  reported,  joumalists  seeking  a
career break  that  will make  them famous,  or  politicians  aiming  to  build  up
their  pro-environmental  credentials,  take  to  denigrating  the  responsible  in-
dustry.  Sensing  an opportunity to  appear virtuous,  the first people  to witness
this  campaign  participate  in  the  denunciations.  In  so  doing,  they  raise  the
volume  of criticism,  which  makes  additional  people  aware  of the  ongoing
transformation  in public  discourse.  The  latter individuals join the  chorus  of
criticism  to build their own reputations, which raises  the volume  further, and
in  this  manner  the  vilification  campaign  grows  through  a reputational  cas-
cade.  The  cascade  completes  its  course  when  news  of the  campaign  has
reached  everyone  who  cares  sufficiently  about  maintaining  a  good  reputa-
tion.

A VAILABILITY  CASCADES

E.  Socialization and Its Limits

The  personal  motives  that  underlie  a  purely  reputational  cascade  differ
fundamentally  from  those  of a  purely informational  one.  In the  reputational
variant, a person  asks himself, "How will my community think of me if I fail
to  endorse  its  dominant  position?"  And  he  then  falls  in  line  upon  gaining
awareness  of the  prevailing  political  mood.  In the  informational  variant,  a
poorly  informed  individual  seeks  the  truth  by  asking  herself, "What  is  the
dominant  view  within  my  society?"  And  she  jumps  on  the bandwagon  in
motion by basing her views  on those of others.  In the former  case  individu-
als  are  motivated  solely  by  social  approval;  in  the  latter  they  want  only  to
know the truth.

Of these  pure  types,  the  reputational  variant  presents  an  oversocialized
view of human  nature.  Although  certain  individuals'  expressions  are  some-
times ruled  solely  by  reputational  concerns,  most people  ordinarily  balance
these  concerns  against the  desire  to  be  truthful  to  others  and  to  themselves.
At the  opposite extreme,  a purely informational  cascade presents an  underso-
cialized  conception  of the  individual.  Only  highly  abnormal  people  convey
knowledge  and  preferences  without  any  regard  for  the  possible  effects  on
their reputations. 17 1  A realistically  socialized view of human nature will treat
people  as  social beings  who  seek acceptance,  as knowledge-seekers  who  are
ready  to  learn  from others,  and  also  as  expressive  agents who  develop  their
individualities  by  speaking  their  minds.  To  be  sure,  people  differ  from  one
another  along  these  dimensions;  some  care  enormously  about  their reputa-
tions, while  others care very little. 72

The balanced  perspective  offered  here  implies that when  a possible risk,
such as the contamination  of a canal,  is characterized  as a dangerous  problem
or,  alternatively,  as  no  threat  whatsoever,  there  will  be  two  distinct  influ-
ences  on  listeners.  On  the  one  hand,  the  characterization  will  shape  their
private  risk  judgments,  risk  preferences,  and  policy  preferences.  On  the
other,  it will teach  them something  about  the evolving  political  climate,  thus
shaping  their  perceptions  of  the  reputational  costs  and  benefits  associated
with the possible  public  expressions.  The public  counterparts  of the forego-
ing  variables-the  judgments  and  preferences  they  choose  to  convey  in  so-

171.  For  critiques  of the  two  extreme  positions,  see  James  S.  Coleman, A  Rational Choice
Perspective on Economic Sociology, in  THE  HANDBOOK  OF  ECONOMIC  SOCIOLOGY  166  (Neil  J.
Smelser & Richard  Swedberg  eds.,  1994);  Mark  Granovetter,  Economic Action  and Social Struc-
ture: The Problem of Embeddedness, 91  Ai. J. SOC.  481  (1985);  and  Dennis H.  Wrong,  The Over-
socialized Conception of Man in Modern Sociology, 26 AM.  SOC.  REv.  183 (1961).

172.  These  differences  across  individuals  are  related  to  differences  in  "social  intelligence,"
which  is the  ability to  navigate  in social  waters.  DAMASIO,  supra note  2,  at  169-70,  traces  such
skill  variations  to differences  in  brain  functions.  See generally HOWARD  GARDNER,  FRAMES  OF
MIND:  THE  THEORY OF  MULTIPLE  INTELLIGENCE  (1983)  (developing  a case  for  using  a  broader,
more varied notion of "intelligence");  and DANIEL GOLEMAN,  EMOTIONAL  INTELLIGENCE  (1995).

cial  settings-will  reflect a combination  of these two influences.  When pub-
lic  discourse  on  the  contamination  undergoes  a  change,  the  transformation
will partly reflect modifications  in people's  actual thoughts  and dispositions,
and partly  their  efforts  to preserve  or gain  social  status,  by adjusting  to  per-
ceived  shifts in social pressures.

As noted  earlier,  these  influences  may  counteract  one  another.  When  a
claim of "no  danger"  comes from  a notoriously  unscrupulous  yet politically
powerful  lobbyist,  the  source  of the  information  may  generate  skepticism,
making  listeners less willing to  endorse the lobbyist's  claim.  But it may also
alert listeners  to the reputational  advantages  earned by those who endorse the
claim publicly,  thus  enhancing  their  willingness to  do so. 173  In the  cases  of
greatest  concern  here,  however,  these  influences  are  mutually  supportive.
The multiplicity  of individual sources  of information makes  the claim hard to
dismiss  as the  concoction  of greedy trouble  makers.  The  claim gains  credi-
bility even as it becomes increasingly prudent to endorse publicly.

F.  The Self-Reinforcement ofAvailability

Both  processes-interdependent  responses  driven  by  reputational  mo-
tives as well  as those  fueled by  informational  motives-add to  the  availabil-
ity of knowledge  pointing to  a danger.  Astute individuals will  sense  that re-
putational  incentives  are breeding  knowledge and preference  falsification.  If
nothing else, involuntary  "body  language" will sometimes  publicize  thoughts
and  feelings  that people  are  striving  to  keep  private. 174  But  one  can  know
that public communications  are partly feigned and try to make allowances  for
the  dissembling  without  discounting  it  sufficiently. 175  The  upshot  is  that
knowledge  and preference  falsification  can have lasting  effects  on  how peo-
ple actually think and feel.

To  make  a risk claim  and the  supportive  data  more available  is to make
information pointing  to  the  absence  of this risk  less  available.  An availabil-
ity  cascade  is necessarily  accompanied,  therefore,  by an  unavailability cas-
cade that progressively  frees public  discourse  of voices  out of tune  with the
evolving  chorus.  This concurrent  cascade makes it increasingly  difficult for
people  with stated  or unstated reservations  about the  developing  public  con-
sensus  to  retain  their misgivings.  Making  their  private  knowledge  increas-
ingly insecure,  it weakens  their resistance;  and  making  their  private  prefer-

173.  People  may consider  it reputationally prudent  to  endorse  the claim  even  if they  under-
stand how  social pressures  are  distorting  the public communications  of others.  One can  recognize
the insincerity of public discourse without being prepared to resist the underlying pressures.

EMOTIONS  134-45  (1988).  The  biological  basis  for  the  incompleteness  of people's  control  over
their  emotions  are  studied  in  DAMASIO,  supra note  2  and  JOSEPH  LEDOUX,  THE  EMOTIONAL
BRAIN:  THE MYSTERIOUS  UNDERPINNINGS  OF EMOTIONAL LIFE (1996).

ences  seem  increasingly  unusual,  it  facilitates  their  participation  in  the
evolving consensus.

Imagine  a  Love  Canal  resident  who,  when  the  story breaks,  thinks  that
the  press  is  over-reacting  and that her  neighbors  are  acting  irrationally.  At
first, she is able to  share her  doubts and misgivings with other skeptical resi-
dents,  and  she  notices  skeptical  commentaries  and  editorials  in  the  press.
But  as  the  cascade  unfolds,  open  skepticism  becomes  progressively  less
common.  She  runs  into  fewer  neighbors  prepared  to  express  reservations
and  encounters  fewer  press  accounts  calling  for  caution.  She  begins  won-
dering whether  she  has been blind  to  facts  obvious  to  almost  everyone  else.
If and  when the  combination  of mounting  social  pressures  and  the transfor-
mation  of her  own thoughts  makes her  cross  her threshold  of resistance,  she
will join the availability  cascade.  Dissenting voices  will then become fainter
still, making  it  that much harder  for the  dwindling number  of open  skeptics
to hold out as critics. 176

The  reputational  costs  imposed  on  critics  may,  over  time,  lead  to  intel-
lectual paralysis.  Insofar  as people refrain  from  expressing  their doubts,  un-
certainties,  and  misgivings,  public  discourse  will  become  impoverished,
eventually  making  people  whose  perceptions  depend  on  public  discourse
stop questioning  what appears  as the  conventional  wisdom.  In other words,
the  unthinkable  ideas  of  one period  can  turn  into  the  unthought  ideas  of a
later one.  In  one  period, people  with doubts  do  not speak  out;  in  the next,
doubts have ceased to  exist. 177

In  the  course  of an  availability  cascade,  the  content  of the  discussions
will  generally  involve  many  of the  risk traits listed  in  Table I.  Communica-
tions  will  address,  for  example,  matters  of equity,  such  as  the  unfairness  of
businesses  endangering  the  safety  of a  middle-class  community.  They  will
establish  a  reference  point  against  which  the  risk  is  to  be  measured.  And
they  will  categorize  the  risk by  highlighting  similarities  with previous  dan-
gers.  As increasing  numbers  of individuals  appear  to  agree  on the specifica-
tions  for  various  acceptability  traits,  and  these  specifications  become  more
available  in  public  discourse,  cognitive  biases  other  than  availability  will
come into play.  For  example,  as a consensus begins to  form  that the episode

176.  The same process  can dampen public concern and  discourage  governmental activity  with
respect  to  dangers  that happen  to be very serious.  The resulting  unavailability errors can  account
for large numbers of premature deaths.  See John D.  Graham, Making Sense of Risk: An Agenda for
Congress, in  RISKS,  COSTS,  AND  LIVES  SAVED:  GETTING  BETrER  RESULTS  FROM  REGULATION
183  (Robert W.  Hahn ed.,  1996)  [hereinafter RISKS,  COSTS, AND  LIVES  SAVED].

resembles  a certain  disaster  of the  past,  the  representativeness  heuristic will
start influencing  people's interpretations.

As Love Canal became  a top news story, many commentators  likened the
episode  to  an  industrial  Vietnam,  noting  that  dioxin  is  one  of the  chemicals
in Agent  Orange,  which  American  forces  used in  the Vietnam  War. 178  Oth-
ers  drew  analogies  to  "Gypsy  hauling"  and  "midnight  dumping, 1 79 which
gave  the  impression  that no  one  is  safe  from  deadly  chemicals,  that  "new
Love  Canals"  could  be unfolding  in  anyone's  backyard  while  they were  off
guard.8 0  These  images  created  an  intellectual  climate  that  hindered  the
maintenance  of a feeling of security.

The  anchoring  effect  also  played  a role.  People  who  heard Love  Canal
characterized  as  a  disaster akin to  the  Vietnam  War,  or  as  an  official  act  of
mass  murder,  tended  to  consider  the  risk  more  serious  than  dispassionate
analysis  of the scientific  data would suggest.  In other words, they  underdis-
counted  the  analogy,  thus  becoming  overly  alarmed  by  the  revealed  evi-
dence.  Certain  newspapers  reinforced  this  process  through reports  that  the
levels of dioxin were  250 to  5000  times greater than what the EPA considers
safe. 81  Such numerical  anchors  must have compounded  any biases rooted  in
the anchoring  effect. 182

treat crimes  involving sneakiness  as  especially  serious.  In  medieval  Europe,  misdemeanors  com-
mitted  at  night  were  punished  with  extraordinary  force.  See  JACQUES  LE  GOFF,  MEDIEVAL

182.  The  availability  of information  is not  the only  determinant  of risk judgments.  In par-
ticular,  there  exist counter-mechanisms  that  may  neutralize,  if not  overpower,  the informational
transformations brought about by availability cascades.  Sometimes  market mechanisms are at work
as well.  Consider the onset of the AIDS crisis.  In the early  1980s, as reports of the AIDS  epidemic
began  to spread, the mass  media became  saturated  with reports on  the dangers of unprotected  gay
sex.  Yet even in  the late  1980s a  significant share of American  gays  were continuing  to  engage in
potentially  fatal sexual practices.  See AIDS:  THE SECOND  DECADE  (Heather  G.  Miller, Charles  F.
Turner  & Lincoln E. Moses  eds.,  1990);  Marshall H.  Becker & Jill G. Joseph, AIDS and Behavioral
Change to Reduce Risk: A  Review, 78  AM.  J. PuB.  HEALTH 394  (1988).  If the availability  of in-
formation  on  sexual  risks  had been  the  only  determinant  of their  behavior,  this  lack  of caution
would not have been observed.  Evidently, other  factors,  including  sexual  drives,  subgroup  norms,
expressive  motivations,  and  cognitive  rationalization  strategies,  played  important  roles. 
In  any
case,  the conceptual  framework  of this  article  is designed  to  capture  the shared  essence  of diverse
struggles over  risk;  as with  any  such framework,  variations  around that essence  are  inevitable.  We
cannot  determine  exactly  why the  variance  is larger  in some  cases  than in others.  Intrinsically  in-
significant  historical  contingencies,  or small  events,  can  make  a huge  difference,  yet  they  cannot
always be identified  ex post.  On small events  and their social significance,  see ARTHUR,  supra note

G.  Availability Campaigns

Like  all  errors,  availability  errors  can  have  significant  social  conse-
quences.  Typically,  there are  both losers  and  winners.  Knowing  this, pres-
sure  groups-some  entirely  self-interested,  others  committed  to  a  social
cause  for  altruistic  reasons-seek  to  instigate  availability  cascades.  Their
chances  of success  are  limited  insofar  as people  have  access  to  reliable  in-
formation  of their  own.  But even  then their  causes  are  not hopeless.  Pres-
sure groups  can alter people's perceptions  of their  self-interest,  or at least the
expression  of their needs, through measures to  prevent frank discussion.

In the  environmental  context,  a common  tactic  is  to  produce  a  headline-
grabbing  uproar  by  dramatizing  a  problem.  Recent  examples  of heavily
publicized  problems  include,  in  addition  to  those  already  mentioned,  the
plight  of the  Giant  Panda,  which  the  World  Wildlife  Fund  has  highlighted,
and  the  Exxon  Valdez  disaster,  which  the  Sierra  Club  and  other  environ-
mental  organizations  have  exploited  to  promote  more  stringent  safeguards
against  oil  spills.  Groups  that  would  bear  the  costs  of the  requested  policy
measures,  such  as  oil  and  shipping  companies  in  the  case  of Exxon  Valdez,
respond  in  kind.  In  particular,  they  draw  attention  to  the  "boy  who  cried
wolf'  phenomenon  in  environmental  politics  and  the  "green-friendly"  as-
pects  of their operations.  At least implicitly, the participants in these contests
understand  both  the reputational  and informational  motives  on  which  avail-
ability cascades  feed.

We  have described  the  instigators  and  manipulators  of availability  cam-
paigns  as  availability  entrepreneurs.  Showing  at  least a  working knowledge
of the  availability  heuristic  and  other  cognitive  processes,  these  entrepre-
neurs seize on  selected  incidents  and  publicize them  to  make  them  generally
salient  to the masses.  They  also draw associations that trigger painful memo-
ries, as when environmentalists  proclaim that operational  nuclear reactors are
setting the stage  for "another  Three Mile Island,"  or when they characterize  a
toxic spill as "a new Love  Canal."  The entrepreneurs  who  coin such phrases
sometimes  act strategically.  In particular,  they select their tactics  in the  hope
of producing cascade  effects beneficial  to their  causes. 83  But many, perhaps
most,  consider their claims  of danger more or less real.  After all,  they them-
selves  are  subject to  the  availability  heuristic  as much as  everyone  else, and
the  fact  that  they  move  in  circles  within  which  the  claim  seems  to  be  be-
lieved  may  have  convinced  them  about  the  existence  of a  tremendous  risk.

183.  These tactics  have  long been known to military strategists who  have  used them to  spread
destructive  rumors  in enemy territories.  Because  much  military planning  is carried  out  in secrecy,
civilians  tend to be  hungry  for  information during  wartime.  Recognizing  this hunger,  propaganda
officers  plant rumors  in  enemy-controlled  lands  to scare  civilians,  disrupt  their morale,  and  divide
them.  Thus,  in World  War II both sides  used leaflets,  newspapers,  radio  broadcasts,  and  specially
trained  agents  to  initiate rumors  among  enemy peoples.  See  Robert  H.  Knapp,  A  Psychology of
Rumor, 8  PuB.  OPINION Q. 22 (1944).

[Vol. 51:683

An  anti-nuclear  activist  may  believe  passionately  in  the  necessity  of elimi-
nating  nuclear  power  because  all  her  friends  are  themselves  opponents  of
nuclear power, and they make the  danger in question very salient  to her.

A common method  for triggering  availability  cascades  is  for  a  group  to
pass  carefully  sifted  information  to selected journalists,  who then rush to  re-
lease  hot  stories  that justify  the  group's  work.  The  information  will  often
contain  grains  of truth,  but it may  also  harbor biases,  even outright  fabrica-,
tions.  We  saw  an  example  in  the  spread  of misleading  information  during
the Alar  episode. 8 4  For  another  such  example,  consider  that in  the  Christ-
mas  season the  media typically  feature  stories  about holiday suicides.  These
stories  give the impression, and sometimes  say explicitly,  that the risk of sui-
cide rises  sharply during the holiday season for people  living alone  (who  feel
especially  lonely),  for the  financially  strapped  (who  realize  that the presents
they want to purchase lie beyond their reach),  and for sundry  other categories
of troubled  people.  In fact,  the  suicide  rate  is  not unusually  high  between
Thanksgiving  and New  Year's,  and  in  some years  it lies  slightly  below the
norm.185  There  are  two reasons  why, nonetheless,  this period  sees a rush of
suicide  stories.  First, the  reporters  who  receive  their information  from  sui-
cide  hotlines  may  not bother  to  check  their  facts.  Second,  and  more  criti-
cally,  the hotlines  have  a  stake  in making  "bad  times"  for emotional  health
coincide  with  "good  times"  for fundraising.  The  hotlines  find  it especially
effective  to  appeal  for  funds  around  Christmas,  which  comes  at  the  end  of
the  tax year,  a time when  taxpayers  develop  greater  awareness  of tax deduc-
tions and, hence,  are more willing to  make charitable donations.18 6

Reports  of suicides tend  to  fuel  new suicides  through processes  akin  to
those  we  are  discussing  here.  Through  the  availability  heuristic,  well-
publicized  suicides foster an awareness  of suicide as a way out of pain.  They
also  reduce  the  stigma  attached  to  suicide,  especially  when  the  victims  are
celebrities who  evoke sympathy.8 7  But to identify  certain adverse effects  of
publicizing  the  commonness  of suicides  hardly  implies  that  the  availability
campaigns  in  question constitute  cases  of cynical,  self-serving  manipulation.
Suicide  hotlines  are run  by people  with honorable  goals:  prevention  of de-
spair and preservation  of life.  Nor  does  our  observation imply that the cam-
paigns  are  counterproductive  on the  whole.  The  lives  saved  through  funds
raised may  well outnumber  those  lost  due  to  the  added holiday-season  pub-
licity.

A VAILABILIlTY  CASCADES

To  generalize,  even  when  cognitive  deception  is  involved,  availability
cascades  may  serve a  socially beneficial purpose.  Indeed,  the  entrepreneurs
who  set them  in  motion  may  well  be  exploiting  heuristic  devices  as  a  re-
sponse  to  private  ignorance  and  public  apathy.  As  with anyone  seeking  to
provide  a public  good,  activists  striving  to  lessen  a  social  risk  face  familiar
obstacles  to  collective  action. 88  Likewise, anyone  seeking  to  reform the  so-
cial  norms associated  with a risky activity,  or even  those pertaining to  public
discourse  about  the activity,  must cope  with  difficult  collective  action  prob-
lems  of their  own.  Suppose  that  the  social  meaning  of complaining  about
second-hand  smoke  is  prissiness  or petulance.  If large numbers  are harmed
or bothered  by  second-hand  smoke,  social  well-being  may  improve through
changes  in  the  relevant  expressive  norms  and,  ultimately,  in the  behavioral
norms themselves.  But the prevailing  social meanings  cannot be changed by
any  particular  individual  acting  alone. 89  For  another  illustration,  suppose
that,  while  the  problem  of global  warming is  serious,  people  trumpeting  the
gravity  of global  warming get  treated  as fanatics.  Those who  happen to be-
lieve  the  statement  may  seek refuge  in  preference  and knowledge  falsifica-
tion, thus  delaying  the  emergence  of a critical  mass  for  action.  Availability
entrepreneurs  help to overcome  collective  action  problems  of this kind;  they
play  a  decisive  role  in  breaking  insincere  resistance  to  the  removal  of pri-
vately recognized  social injustices,  problems,  and  inefficiencies.  In acting as
manipulative  salespeople,  therefore,  they  sometimes  perform  vital  social
services.

H.  Roles of the Media and Political Institutions

Whatever  the merits  of their campaigns,  availability  entrepreneurs  make
use  of political  institutions  and  the  media  to  trigger  cascades.  In  one  com-
mon  pattern,  a  special-interest  group  supplies  information  to  members  of
Congress,  who then hold hearings that enable  the group  to  testify and publi-
cize  its mission.  During the process, journalists  help spread the  group's mes-
sage, partly through leaks  they receive.  Citizens join the fray through letters,
phone  calls,  and  participation  in  talk shows,  thus  heightening  awareness  of
the  identified  problem,  as  happened  in  the  Love  Canal  and  Alar  scares.
Eventually,  laws  or  regulations  are  adopted  that  give  the  instigating  group
fresh  opportunities  to  provoke  new  uproars  in  order  to  strengthen  the
achieved  general consciousness.1 90

The tasks  of special-interest  groups  are  facilitated  by  the  willingness  of
journalists  to  accept  and  report  claims  fed  to  them  by  special-interest
groups. 191  If the  mass  media  often  report carelessly,  an  important  reason  is
that  few  people  realize  the  extent  to  which  reporters  rely  on  slanted  press
releases  and  strategic  leaks.  For  exactly  the  same  reason  that  there  exists
widespread  rational  ignorance  on  any social  issue-the  boundedness  of hu-
man  cognitive  capabilities-ignorance  is  widespread  about  the  sources  of
news bulletins.  The typical citizen has no time  to investigate  whether  a story
about an environmental hazard  or an industrial safety matter has come from a
trade  association,  a fundraising  operation,  or a  regional  group  that  stands  to
benefit  disproportionately  from  resources  allocated  to  solving  the  problem.
When they  watch film  clips  on television,  read statistics in the newspaper,  or
hear  a radio interview,  they  frequently  presume  that the information  reflects
the  findings  of disinterested journalists. 192  But  often  the  media  are  simply
using  videotapes,  audiotapes,  and reports  prepared  by  a party  driven  to  en-
hance  the  availability  of certain  perceptions  and  viewpoints  and  expecting
the consequent  transformation to  fuel  a cascade. 193

The wide acceptance  that falsehoods  gain in the popular imagination  can
be traced partly,  of course,  to  those  who  concoct and  first report them.  But
another  part of the responsibility  falls  on individuals  who  spread  news  that
they hear, thus making it increasingly  available to others.

IV.  POPULIST FIRESTORMS  AND DEMOCRATIC  RISK REGULATION

Availability  cascades  create  serious  problems  for  democracy  and  raise
important issues for democratic  theory.  They create  a danger that apparently
democratic  outcomes  will rest on misinformation and  be unrepresentative,  in
any  normatively  attractive  sense,  of  citizens'  actual  beliefs,  desires,  and
judgments. 
In  discussing  the  relation  between  availability  cascades  and
democratic  theory,  our focus  remains  on risk regulation,  although  the  impli-
cations derived  in  this Part of the  article, like  the remedies  we  shall propose
in the next Part, have much broader relevance.

191.  A group  ofjournalism students at the  University of Tennessee  demonstrated  this by  con-
cocting  a  fictitious  press release  from  a group  opposed  to  "political  correctness"  and  mailed  it to
many newspapers.  See id. at 155-56.  Although most newspapers  ignored the release,  many ran the
story  immediately, without corroborating the claim or interviewing the ostensible villains.  See id. at
156.  One  even  embellished  the  purported  case  of intolerance  by  adding  fabricated  details  to  the
original  release.  See id.

192.  This is so even if they have a low opinion ofjournalists.  It is one thing to have a gener-

ally negative impression  about a profession, another to identify particular cases  of sloppiness.

193.  For  example, news  about the  sudden  flood of child  abductions by  strangers  in the  mid-
1980s was  concocted  by an organization  that saw the claim as  a convenient  tool  for focusing  atten-
tion  and raising money.  The  same  is true  of reports  that violence  against  American women  peaks
on the day of the Super Bowl.  See Dunn, supra note  186, at 18.

A VAILABILITY  CASCADES

Above  all, the argument thus far indicates  that "public opinion"  about the
regulation  of risks (the distribution  of public  policy preferences)  constitutes a
highly problematic  basis  for government  policy.  This is partly because  pub-
licly  expressed  demands  for regulation  are  likely  to  conceal  doubt,  ambiva-
lence,  and concern.  But the corresponding  "private  opinion"  (the distribution
of private  policy  preferences) 94 may  also  constitute  a poor  foundation  for
policy, because  availability  cascades  often  spread falsehoods  that overwhelm
sound scientific reports.1 95

Our  call  for caution  about  populist  firestorms  evokes  two  time-honored
themes  of the  American  tradition of public  law.  The  first involves  the ideal
of deliberative  democracy,  which  elaborates  on  the  principle  of democratic
judgment by  insisting  that  policies  be  based  on  careful  deliberation  and re-
flection  rather  than  on  mechanical  reactions  to  citizen  preferences.1 96  A
principal  point of the  original  Constitution was to  ensure  that representatives
"refine  and enlarge"  popular sentiment, rather  than  automatically  translate  it
into law. 197  The key institutions of the American  system of government  were
designed  to  promote  the  desired  filtering.  The  second  and  more  modem
theme  is that policy  choices  should rest  on sound knowledge  of relevant evi-
dence.  In  the  context of risk regulation,  this objective  requires  a measure  of
deference  to  the purely  factual judgments  of scientific  experts.1 98  It also  re-
quires  democratic  policy  makers  to  discount  regulatory  demands  rooted  in
availability  cascades  based  on  false  information,  to  pay  special  attention  to
trained  experts  who have  had  time to put claims  in perspective,  and to  show
initiative  in  responding  to  significant problems  that the citizenry  happens  to
be overlooking.

The  deliberative  ideal  thus rejects,  simultaneously,  both the purely  tech-
nocratic  form  of democracy,  which  seeks  to  derive  policies  solely  from  the
judgments  of technical  experts,  and  the  purely  populist  form. 199  Proposing
that the  government  need  not respond  to  each  and  every  risk-related  claim
that  a  majority  might  articulate,  it  invites  government  officials  to  be  delib-
erative  as well as responsive.  By the  same token, it insists that scientific evi-
dence  alone  cannot  dispose  of policy  questions.  Sometimes  the  evidence

concerning  a  risk  cannot  be  assessed  without  introducing  contentious  as-
sumptions,  as  with  the  evaluative  notion  of  "conservative  assumptions."200
But  even  when  the  facts  are  easily  identified  and  when  perceptions  do  not
depend on controversial assumptions,  assessing the  significance  of perceived
reality-or  of the  demonstrable  factor-requires  evaluative judgments  that
are  better  made  democratically  than  by  experts.  In no  way,  then,  does  the
deliberative  ideal  instruct governments  to  ignore the  "popular  will."  On the
contrary,  it instructs  governments  to  take  the  "popular  will"  seriously,  both
by  attending  to  reflective  judgments  of  value  and  by  staying  attuned  to
mechanisms  that govern the construction of any "popular will."

Suppose, for  example,  that  more lives  can be  saved by regulating  bicy-
cles  than  by regulating  coal-fired  power plants.  It does  not  follow  that  the
government  should  automatically  accord  priority  to  reducing  the  former
source  of risk.  As  studies on risk acceptability  show, popular judgments may
well depend  on factors  other than the life-years  at stake.  From a deliberative
perspective, judgments  about  qualitative  differences  among  risks  can  legiti-
mately influence  political decisionmaking  and legal  outcomes, provided  they
are  reflective  and  can  survive  critical  scrutiny.20 1  Specifically,  such  judg-
ments should be based to  the extent possible on an  accurate understanding  of
the facts,  including the range of scientific uncertainty.  In sum, a deliberative
democracy  seeks  not only  to ensure  the  accuracy  of risk judgments but also
to weight these according to reflective risk preferences.

Some  contemporary  research  on  risk suggests  that  experts  and  ordinary
people  display  "rival  rationalities," 20 2  with  ordinary  people  focusing  on  a
relatively  "broader" set  of variables.  Insofar  as ordinary people  do display a
richer  rationality,  their  considerations  should  certainly  influence  regulatory
policy.  Yet what appears as a "richer"  rationality  often rests on the cognitive
and  communicative  distortions  highlighted  in  this  article.  The  extent  to
which these  distortions  are significant  in any particular  context is  an  empiri-
cal matter.  At the very least, however, the demand  for risk regulation may be
based  on  serious  distortions.  The  phenomenon  of  availability  cascades
points,  then,  to  the  possibility  of a  large  gap  between  any  snapshot  of the
"popular  will" and the  appropriate judgments  of a democratic government.

A.  Resisting Availability Errors

The  first  and  most basic  implication  of the  foregoing  analysis  is  that  a
representative government  may justifiably question  the private risk judg-
ments  and preferences that  underlie people's public  communications on

matters relating to risks.  Where  people  learn about risks and become  sensi-
tized  to  them  largely  on  the  basis  of the  apparent  understandings  of others,
availability  errors  may play important roles.  Although  rampant  anxiety  over
a  pesticide  or  an  abandoned  waste  site  could  stem  from  a  scientifically  de-
monstrable  reality of a  danger, it could  also reflect  misperceptions  grounded
in  an  availability  cascade.  Therefore,  a  properly  functioning  government
committed to  people's  well-being  will  not respond  mechanically  to  expres-
sions  of anxiety.  Rather  than  taking  conveyed  risk judgments  and  prefer-
ences as given,  it will  be open  to the possibility  of pervasive misperceptions.
And where  it finds  misperceptions,  it will  endeavor  to  lessen public  anxiety
by correcting them.

Even where  private  opinion about a risk does not rest on misperceptions,
there  may  exist a problem  rooted  in  preference  and knowledge  falsification.
Public opinion about the severity of a social risk, or about the appropriate
government response, may be unrepresentative of the underlying private risk
judgments and preferences.  The  words  and  deeds  that shape  public  opinion
and public  discourse  need not be  entirely sincere.  Private  support for  a par-
ticular  agenda  may be much  weaker  than  the  corresponding  public  support;
likewise,  private  judgments  of the  risk  in  question  may  be  less  severe  than
In  the  absence  of offsetting  mechanisms,  such

distortions  can  have  serious  political  consequences.  Groups  clamoring  for
quick  and  massive  action  to  reduce  a  risk  will  exploit  a  favorable  public
opinion  to  advance  their  causes.  Pointing  to  the  overt  support  their  cause
draws  from  the  media,  they will  extend their  demands  and  make politicians
bow to their  wishes.  In view of this logic,  a government  that abides by pub-
lic opinion  in mechanical  fashion  would  be committing  an availability  error
of its own.

To  the  extent it is  desirable  for  policy  responses  to  reflect  private  opin-
ion, policy  makers  would  do  well  to  pay  special  attention  to  polling instru-
ments that give respondents  anonymity.  Such  surveys,  unlike  exercises  that
make public the  responses of participants,  and unlike the public  statements  of
journalists  and  politicians,  allow people  to  express  unpopular  views  without
fear of retaliation. 2 3  To be  sure, there are  sometimes  solid  reasons to  avoid

203.  One  commentator has  argued that preferences  expressed  in settings  that encourage  care-
ful  consideration  of the  facts, respectful  listening,  and  open-ended  learning  are more valuable  than
those  expressed  outside  of such  settings.  See  JAMES  S.  FISHKIN,  THE  VOICE  OF  THE  PEOPLE
(1995).  "Deliberative  opinion  polling,"  the device  Fishkin  proposes  for  creating  the  appropriate
setting, gives participants  the cover  of anonymity  only in the polling  that concludes  several days of
deliberation.  See  id. at 161-76.  This  leaves the device  open  to distortions rooted in preference  and
knowledge  falsification.  Insofar  as  its  discussions  are  afflicted  by  insincerity,  the  learning  that  it
fosters  will  reflect  the censored  thoughts  that participants  choose  to  communicate  rather  than  the
group's  sincere  and  complete  understandings.  Even  the members  of a  small  and  educated  group
may feel  compelled  to shade or misrepresent their preferences  and judgments.  Moreover, availabil-
ity cascades  may play a role in the transformation  of its  private sentiments.  In principle,  however,
the educational  advantages  of deliberative  polling  can  be combined  with those  of anonymous  polls

[Vol. 51:683

following  even the  dictates  of private  opinion.  With respect to risk issues  on
which  individuals  are  unlikely  to  be  sufficiently  informed  to  make  good
judgments,  or where cognitive  biases tend  to produce  distortions, the private
opinion of an  educated representative  sample  may be more valuable  than that
of the population  as a whole.  The point remains,  however, that governments
can  protect  their  policies  from  serious  availability  distortions  through
mechanisms  identifying some form  of private opinion.2°4

Each  of our  first  two  implications  goes  against  an  inclination  common
for  more  than half a  century  in  neoclassical  economics  as  well  as  its  many
cross-disciplinary  derivatives,  including  the  economic  analysis  of law: 
the
tendency  to  equate  people's  choices 205  with  "revealed  preferences"  that  the
social  system  must  accommodate  in the interest  of efficiency. 20 6  Whatever
the  setting  in which preferences  are  expressed,  what they  "reveal"  depends
on the stimuli  responsible  for their  formation.  A given  distribution of public
preferences  may  signal  that  the  pertinent  individuals  have  felt  pressured  to
keep  certain  types of information  to themselves.  Alternatively,  those prefer-
ences  may  point  to  people's  lack  of exposure  to  private  knowledge  whose
uncensored  circulation  would have produced important influences.  In and  of
themselves,  people's  words and deeds  concerning risks  tell us too  little about
what  they  truly  know,  what  they  sincerely  want,  and  what  influences  have
shaped  their  dispositions,  attitudes,  and  sensitivities.  From  the  knowledge
that  eighty percent  of the  American  people  support  a  massive  program  to
clean  up  a  waste  site,  one  cannot  legitimately  infer  that  such  a  program
would  please  even  the  majority.  Nor  should  one  infer  that  the  program

conducted  and  revealed  before  the  final  distribution  of preferences  is  determined.  For  further  de-
tails,  see  Timur  Kuran,  Insincere Deliberation and Democratic Failure, 12  CRITICAL  REv.  529
(1998).

204.  Anonymous polling raises  problems  of its own.  "Private"  is not necessarily  "good";  if it
were,  no one would suffer  publicly  unarticulated  guilt, and  many  therapists  would go out of busi-
ness.  To feel  pangs  of conscience  over  one's  own private  preferences  is actually  a  common  phe-
nomenon.  Social pressures  that constrain  public expressions,  or that give priority  to public prefer-
ences,  can  therefore  have  a  "laundering  effect."  In  particular, they  may serve  to filter  out inclina-
tions that people  consider illicit and  would rather not have,  even  if they would act  on those inclina-
tions  if given  the opportunity  to choose privately.  But  in the contexts  of interest  here,  such  inner
conflicts  are  not always  present.  Citizens  harboring  private misgivings  about  Superfund  need  not
consider  those misgivings  unethical; if they refrain  from publicizing  these misgivings,  their motiva-
tion will  generally  be to  avoid  social reprisals.  So  polls  that give  citizens  anonymity  might yield
valuable  information  that  ought  to  play  a  role  in  any  regulatory  choice.  See  Robert  E.  Goodin,
Laundering Preferences, in  FOUNDATIONS  OF  SOCIAL  CHOICE  THEORY  75-102  (Jon  Elster  &
Aanund Hylland eds.,  1991).

205.  Ordinarily, the choices  are construed  as deeds  rather than words.
206.  It has long  been recognized, however, that people need  not have  the incentives  to reveal
their  true willingness  to pay  for public goods.  See  HAL  R.  VARIAN,  MICROECONOMIC  ANALYSIS
(3d ed.  1992),  for a general  discussion,  and  Theodore  Groves  & John  Ledyard,  OptimalAllocation
of Public Goods: A  Solution to the  "Free Rider" Problem, 45  ECONOMETRICA  783  (1977),  for  a
much  discussed mechanism to elicit the true demand for a public good.

would retain majority support  if public  discourse were  unimpeded by reputa-
tional concerns.

As  in any  context  involving  interdependent  decisionmaking,  the outlined
model  admits multiple  equilibria.  Depending  on  initial reports  of the perti-
nent data, the  same  set  of human psychologies  and  the same  objective  facts
can yield  vastly  different  outcomes.  If the  reports  paint  a picture  of minor
contamination  unlikely to harm  the  environment,  anyone  who  sounds  alarm
bells  will  look  foolish,  and  society  will  get  little  exposure  to  alarmist  dis-
course.  There  will be no build-up of anxiety,  and no  outcry for massive  gov-
ernment  intervention.  By contrast,  if the initial  reports raise the specter of an
environmental  disaster  that has made  an  entire  region  unfit  for human  habi-
tation,  an  availability  cascade  that  favors  massive  intervention  may  gather
momentum.  And  if a cascade  is triggered,  people  with information  suggest-
ing  the  absence  of a  serious  problem  will  increasingly  resort  to  knowledge
and  preference  falsification,  causing  the  retreat  of public  opposition  to  a
massive cleanup  effort.  The lack  of public  dissent may convince  large  num-
bers  of previously  content people  that greedy  industrialists  are making  earth
unlivable.

B.  Social Influences on Cognitive Processes

Even  in  the  absence  of availability  cascades,  cognitive  biases  can  have
substantial  effects  on  perceptions  and  decisions.  Yet  in exploiting a basic
judgmental heuristic-the availability heuristic-availability cascades ag-
gravate various  cognitive  biases,  with  socially  costly  consequences for
regulatory policy.

Regardless  of how  public  discourse  evolves,  certain  heuristics  will  be
used  regularly,  and  certain  biases  will  always  be  very  common.  Consider,
once  again,  the  fear  of snakes.  Many  people  fear  even  physically harmless
snakes, probably  because  such fear provided  evolutionary  advantages  to our
distant  ancestors who  lived in environments  where  certain  snakes posed life-
threatening  dangers.  This  suggests that snake  phobia  (ophidiophobia)  is  in-
nate  and  easily  activated  in  environments  teeming  with  reptiles.207  But  to
recognize  a fear's innateness  establishes neither the fixity of its intensity nor
that  of its  expression.  Social  forces  may  aggravate  any  individual's  snake
phobia  by  giving  salience  to  dangerous  human  encounters  with  snakes  and
exaggerating  their  commonness.  Counteracting  social  forces  may  have  a
calming  influence  by  suppressing  information  about  dangerous  encounters
and reinforcing  information  about benign ones.

207.  Charles  Darwin  tried  to  overcome  his  fearful  reactions  to snakes,  without success.  See
CHARLES  DARWIN,  THE  EXPRESSION  OF  THE EMOTIONS  IN  MAN  AND  ANIMALS  27-49  (Univ.  of
Chicago  Press  1965)  (1872).  For recent  contributions  to  the study  of innate  dispositions,  see  THE
ADAPTED MIND,  supra note  148 and LEDOUX, supra note  174.

STANFORD LAWREVIEW

[Vol.  51:683

Like  the fear of snakes,  the  fear of falling  victim  to human  aggression  is
innate.  But the  perceived  risk of, say, date rape  on  a particular  campus,  can
be heightened  by giving high publicity to a few crimes through  dissemination
campaigns  or  efforts  to  reward  victims  with  special  status.  By  the  same
logic,  the perceived  risk  of rape  can  be  lowered  through measures  that  sup-
press  information  on  crime.  If women  who  claim  to  have  been  raped  are
treated  as promiscuous  whiners, many rapes  will  go  unreported.  To the  ex-
tent that the resulting misperceptions  make victims  even  less willing to report
crimes,  an availability  cascade  that reduces  the perceived  risk of rape  will be
put in motion.20 8

C.  Undesirable Law and Policy

Another  immediate implication is that public discourse on any given risk
may produce scientifically unnecessary, ineffective,  even  counterproductive
policies.  This  follows  from  the  possibility  of  untruthful  and  uninformed
public  discourse.  If people  base  their judgments  on  what other  people  say
and  do,  and  if the  words  and  deeds  of these  others  are  weakly  informed,
public  discourse  will rest on  flawed judgments.  And  if people  who happen
to  possess  information  pointing  to  the  unlikelihood  of serious  danger  hide
their doubts  about  the  wisdom  of committing  massive  resources  to  cleaning
up  harmless  wastes,  the  supporters  of the  clean-up  program  will  easily
achieve their aims.  Having won the political struggle, they will then  see their
empirically  unsupportable  claims  of danger  become  the  conventional  wis-
dom.

A key element  of the logic  here is the malleability  of risk judgments.  In-
sofar  as  individual  risk  judgments  develop  interdependently,  people  may
make  one  another  believe  in  the  omnipresence  of  enormous  risks  that  are
actually  trivial.  Many risks form  a psychological  burden,20 9 so  such misper-
ceptions  can fuel widespread  anxiety that the government  tries to  alleviate by
diverting  resources  from  programs  addressing  genuine,  scientifically  verifi-
able  problems.  A program  to  wipe  out  a  minuscule  risk  cannot  be particu-
larly  effective  as  measured  by  saved  lives  or health  improvements;  in  dis-
torting  economic  decisions  and  lowering  economic  growth,  it  might  even
lower life spans.  True,  the regulations  would  foster comfort  by making peo-
ple  feel  that -something is  being done  about  a  risk they  consider  significant.
But  if the  risk  were  imaginary,  the  regulations  would  only  undo  a psycho-

logical  damage  created  by  the  very  social  process  responsible  for  the  pre-
vailing fears.

D.  Enduring Harm

Like  purely  informational  and purely  reputational  cascades,  availability
cascades  eventually  come  to  a  stop.  One reason  is  that some  learning  takes
place  independently  of social  forces,  as  when  a  person  who  accidentally
drinks  a glass  of water  from  Love  Canal  senses,  when  he  remains  healthy,
that  the  Canal's  toxicity  is  exaggerated.  Another  reason  is  that  the  social
approval obtainable  through various  forms  of insincerity  can come  at the ex-
pense  of intrinsic  benefits.  People  who  complain  about  actually  harmless
waste  sites  incur  huge  costs  when  the  government  orders  their  relocation.
Their  reputational  benefits  are  accompanied  by  intrinsic  inconveniences.
The  cascade  comes to  a stop when  individuals  have no net  incentive to  alter
the  preferences  or judgments  they  convey to others.  By definition,  the stop-
ping point forms  an expressive equilibrium.

This brings us to yet another, particularly  alarming implication.  Once an
expressive  equilibrium is  established, and a  risk  alleviation policy  is  in
place, both the  equilibrium and the associated policies may  endure even  if
subsequent scientific evidence discredits the  information that triggered the
cascade responsible for their emergence.  Part  of the reason  is that the equi-
librium  influences  the  subsequent  evolution  of knowledge  about alternative
risks.  But  another  part  is  that it conditions  people's reputational  incentives.
Consider  individuals who,  whether through  study, experience,  or exposure  to
dissent,  develop  doubts  about  the  prevailing  conventional  wisdom.  They
will  find  that, by  publicizing  their  views,  they  would make  themselves  un-
popular  without much chance  of reshaping the substance  of public  discourse
on their  own.  To  influence  that  substance, they must  overcome  a  collective
action problem.  By choosing to  keep  quiet, or  even to pay  lip  service  to  the
new  conventional  wisdom,  they  will  contribute  to  preserving  the  prevailing
public  discourse  and  the  associated  misperceptions.  The  continuing  fear  of
abandoned hazardous waste dumps offers a central  case in point.

A  related  implication  concerns  the  beliefs  of  generations  too  young  to
have experienced  the availability  cascade  that resulted  in the prevailing poli-
cies.  The public discourse shaped by  the cascade will contribute to the per-
ceptions of new generations. Insofar  as young generations form  their beliefs
on  the  basis  of  informational  availability,  what  they  learn  will  reflect  the
distortions  of the prevailing  public  discourse.  Even  today, two decades  after
scientists  found  the  alleged  health  hazards  of Love  Canal  essentially  un-
founded,  references  to  the  region  evoke  thoughts  of profit-hungry  industrial
bosses  destroying  a  gorgeous  countryside  and risking  the  lives  of helpless
multitudes  for  the  sake  of their  own  enrichment.  Many  people  who  have

never  been to  the Niagara  Falls region,  even  those not yet  born  when  Love
Canal  made  the  headlines  daily,  know  of the  episode  through  a public  dis-
course  still controlled  by  an  availability  cascade  that  ran  its  course  twenty
years  ago.210

E.  Uncoordinated Law

A basic observation that undergirds  the entire  analysis has been that peo-
ple's cognitive  limitations make them  compartmentalize  their risks.  Specifi-
cally,  it makes  them  consider risks essentially  in isolation from  one  another,
rather than jointly and in a manner that permits the identification  of tradeoffs.
Because  such  compartmentalization  is ubiquitous, risk regulations may show
great variability across different risks, among different populations, and over
time.  Let us  take up each of these  implications in turn.

If availability cascades  have taken  off in  some contexts  but not in others,
historical  precedents  will  differ  across  compartmentalized  risk  issues. 
It
follows  that the  policies  adopted  to deal  with these  risks  may be  grossly in-
consistent.  Our framework  thus  yields  insights  into  data  showing  huge dis-
crepancies  across  the  cost-effectiveness  of American  regulations  aimed  at
saving  lives. 211  At one  extreme,  the  cost of regulations  on  steering  columns
and space heaters is  only $100,000  per saved life. 21 2  At the opposite extreme,
that  of regulations  on  certain  carcinogens  cost  well  over  $10  million  per
saved life.  Part of the  explanation is that availability  cascades  can  draw peo-
ple's  attention  away  from  important  risks  and  make  them  focus  on  trivial
ones.

Another puzzle illuminated by  this analysis is  that observed wage  differ-
ences  across  occupations  typically  differ  dramatically  from those  predicted
by  the  theory  of compensating  wage  differentials. 213  In  its  standard  form,
this  theory  states  that riskier  occupations  will  tend  to  pay  more  than  safer

210.  Our own  informal  survey of law  students  at the  University  of Chicago  reveals  that  the
problem  of "abandoned  hazardous  waste  sites"  ranks  high  among  a  long  list  of social  risks,  even
though few  experts  would concur.  See  Christopher Houston  & Cass  R. Sunstein,  Risk Assessment
and Resource Allocation Among Law Students, 48 J. LEGAL EDUc.  496  (1998).

ones. 214  In reality, the relevant variables  are not the risks of alternative occu-
pations  but  their  perceived risks.  And  these  perceived  risks  may  diverge
from  actual  risks  because  of availability  cascades  that have  distorted  public
knowledge.  Society  may  end up  compensating  some  workers  for imagined
risks while  failing  to  compensate  other  workers  for real risks.  And  the  very
perceptions  responsible  for  these market  outcomes  pressure  the  government
into imposing workplace regulations  at odds  with true risks.

If a single nation does  not coordinate  its risk regulations,  such coordina-
tion  can  hardly be  expected  at the  international  level.  Hence  there  may  be
huge variations  in  the policies  that different nations  bring to bear  on  a given
risk.215  We  have  already  touched  on  the  startling  contrast  between  the
popularity  and  widespread  reliance  on nuclear  power  in France  and  its un-
popularity  and  sharply  limited use  in the  United  States.216  Another  remark-
able  cross-continental  contrast  concerns  genetically  altered  food.  As  of
1998,  consumers  all  across Europe  are in  open revolt  over  the  prospect of a
future  where  all fruits and vegetables  come  from  genetically altered  seeds.2 17
Prince  Charles  voiced  a popular  European  sentiment  when  he  declared  that
no  genetically  altered  food  would  enter  his mouth.218  "That  takes  mankind
into realms  that belong  to  God,  and  God alone,"  he explained.219  In Britain,
vandalism  against  genetic testing  sites  has become  so  common  that the  gov-
ernment is  striving to  conceal  their locations.220  In  sharp  contrast,  American

AND SAFETY  IN THE WORKPLACE  (1983).

215.  A counteracting  force  here consists of falling  communication costs.  The consequent ex-
pansion  in  international  communications  allows  cascades  in  one  country  to  have  rapid  spillover
effects  elsewhere.  Such  spillover  effects  can  generate  availability supercascades-intemational
availability cascades  whose units are  availability cascades  within individual  countries.  As a case  in
point,  heightened  attention  to  second-hand  smoke  in  the  United  States  stimulates  anti-smoking
campaigns  in  other  countries.  See,  e.g.,  Ray  Kennedy,  South  Africa  Tipped for  Smoking Ban,
Tn  IES  (London),  OcL  21,  1998,  at  14  (noting  that  the  focus  of  the World  Health  Organization's
anti-smoking  campaigns  has  shifted  to  developing  countries).  Likewise,  as  smokers  and  the de-
fenders of their  freedoms  lose  status  in the United  States,  they also  do  so  around  the globe,  espe-
cially  in economically  advanced  democracies.  Still,  the "global  village"  lies  in the future with re-
spect to the equalization  of attitudes and policies  toward risks.  In another context, the global  spread
of ethnic  consciousness,  international  supercascades,  and  the factors  that limit their  reach  are  dis-
cussed  by  Timur  Kuran,  Ethnic  Dissimilation  and  Its  International  Diffusion,

consumers  are  for  the  time  being  fairly  relaxed  about  genetic  engineering,
perhaps  because most are unaware  of how  common this  alteration  procedure
has become.2 21

The  possibility  of variability  over  time  in  any  country  reflects  the  vul-
nerability  of many  cascade-generated  equilibria.  Because  the  public  dis-
course that supports  a given  expressive  equilibrium may rest substantially  on
preference  and knowledge  falsification,  even  an  inherently  minor shock may
have huge repercussions.  Specifically, by making  hidden doubts  surface  and
by  giving  exposure  to  unarticulated  knowledge,  the  right  shock  will  alter
public  discourse  and  cause the  equilibrium to  unravel.  The  unraveling may
even cause both expressive  and substantive  fears to change sides,  ushering in
a dramatically  different  expressive  equilibrium.  As  a case  in point, a quarter-
century ago  few people  considered  second-hand smoke  a health hazard.  And
members  of this  tiny  minority  could  not  ask  smokers  to  move  elsewhere
without  risking  angry  or  condescending  reactions.  Now  most  Americans
consider  second-hand  smoke  harmful,  and  many  seriously  exaggerate  the
risk.222  Today  it  is  smokers,  the  minority,  who  risk  ostracism  when  they
publicly  assert  that  second-hand  smoke  is  harmless.  Likewise,  only  a  few
years ago, nonscientists  showed little concern about the  thinning of the  ozone
layer.  Now most  people  seem  alarmed.  Each  of these  transformations  oc-
curred  over  periods  much shorter  than it took for  the relevant  scientific  evi-
dence  to  accumulate.  Early  on  in  the  paper,  we  saw  evidence  of an  even
faster transformation.  It took just a  few months  for Love  Canal  to  heighten
fears of industrial waste sites.22 3

V.  INSTITUTIONAL  SAFEGUARDS  AGAINST HARMFUL  CASCADES:  TOWARD
COMPREHENSIVE  RATIONALITY

Our  analysis  raises  the  possibility  of large  gains  from  institutional  re-
forms.  The  motivation for  such reforms  is  that availability  cascades  consti-
tute  a major, perhaps  the  leading,  source  of the  risk-related  scares  that have
cramped  federal regulatory policy at both the legislative and executive levels,
with  high  costs  in  terms  of  lives  lost,  lowered  quality  of life,  and  dollars
wasted.  Especially when  they run their  course  quickly,  cascades  force  gov-
ernments  to  adopt expensive  measures  without  careful  consideration  of the
facts.  The  consequent rush to  action need not pose a problem where the  cas-
cade  draws  attention  to  a  major neglected  risk  and  the  proposed  measures
turn  out  to  solve  a  genuine  social  problem;  as  already  mentioned  above,

A VAILABILITY  CASCADES

availability  cascades  can  produce  a  lot  of good.  For the  reasons  discussed
above,  however,  the  mere  fact  that  vast numbers  of citizens  are  calling  for
the  alleviation  of a perceived  risk,  or  that they  are  demanding  a  particular
risk reduction  program,  provides  no  guarantee  that even  they  would benefit
from  having  the  government  sheepishly  fall  in line.  It  does not  even mean
that they truly desire the measures  they are championing.

A.  Passions and Constraints

Many  features  of the  prevailing  system  of checks  and  balances  offer
protection  against availability  cascades.  For example,  the  bicameral  legisla-
ture  prevents  cascades  within  one  chamber  from creating  legislation  on their
own.  Still,  as  matters  now  stand,  the American  government  is  imperfectly
equipped to  provide  meaningful  resistance  against social  pressures  grounded
in misinformation.  When there is  an upsurge  of interest  in addressing  a par-
ticular  risk, the  government  loses  its  ability to  set sensible  priorities,  under-
take  long-range  planning,  and  enforce  intertemporal  consistency. 224  It  has
been  estimated  that  the  American  government  could  save  an  additional
60,000  lives  per  year  at no  additional  cost  or, alternatively,  save  the lives  it
currently  does  for as much as  $31  billion less than  it now  spends.22  The re-
forms  proposed  in  this  Part  would  provide  instruments  for  achieving  such
gains.

The notion  of institutional  safeguards  against availability  cascades  is  far
from  foreign  to  American  history.  Parts  of the  Federalist Papers show  an
awareness  of cascades  and their  effects  on public  discourse.226  Many  of the
founding  institutions  can  be  understood  as  instruments  designed  to  reduce
dangers  associated  with  cascades.  In  addition  to  the  bicameral  legislature,
such instruments  include  national  representation,  federalism,  and  the  execu-
tive  veto to reopen  and temper  legislative  debates.  Numerous  post-founding
innovations  fulfil  related  functions.  Among  them  are  specialized  legislative
committees,  an  appropriations  committee  to  oversee  the  whole  budget,  and
conference  committees  to  resolve  differences  between  legislative  chambers.
Individually  and  collectively,  these  structures  provide  opportunities  for  im-
proving  the  accuracy  of information  used in policymaking,  refining priority-
setting,  identifying  trade-offs,  promoting  deliberation,  and  reaching  reason-
able  compromises  among  competing judgments and interests.

The  measures  proposed  and  defended  below  are  meant  to  develop  the
existing  system in the light of modem realities.  One  of our objectives  is to
strengthen  the role  of science  in  risk regulation-a role  that  several  groups
have  tried to  weaken.227  To  this end, we  seek to  provide regulators  with bet-
ter  insulation  against  sudden  and  intense  mass  calls  for  immediate  action
(partly to  allow  them  to  address  significant  risks  that  public  opinion  is  ig-
noring).  It bears repeating  that people may  legitimately  find  some risks less
acceptable  than others  that  are quantitatively  identical.  But  these judgments
should  be made  with reference  to  the  best  possible  understanding  of reality
rather than mass hysteria.

Our most  general  goal  is  the  attainment  of  "comprehensive  rationality"
in risk regulation.  All too  often  the government  focuses  on problems in iso-
lation  from  related  problems,  and  political  forces  hinder  sensible  priority-
setting.  Through  institutional  arrangements  that  amount  to precommitment
strategies, 228  the making  and  implementation  of laws  can  be  shielded  from
myopic,  ephemeral,  or counterproductive  social pressures.

None  of our proposals  will be described  in minute detail.  Our intention
is  simply  to  outline  certain  basic  institutional  reforms.  We  begin  by  ad-
dressing  a recent  initiative  designed  to  make  it costly  for  availability  entre-
preneurs  to  launch  cascades  that  generate  scientifically  unjustified  mass
anxiety.

ship, although he  had deliberately  packed it with nonsensical jargon and  impenetrable  ideas  to dem-
onstrate  their'own incompetence  and  the  absurdity  of what passes as  the "cultural  studies"  critique
of science.  See  Alan  Sokal,  A  Physicist Experiments with  Cultural Studies,  LINGUA  FRANCA,

A VAILABILITY  CASCADES

B.  Product Defamation Laws

The Texas  lawsuit that pitted beef producers  against television  talk show
host Oprah  Winfrey229 brought  into sharp relief one  possible measure  against
harmful  availability  cascades:  civil  actions  to  deter  individuals  and  groups
from  instigating  or  aggravating  such  cascades  in the  hope  of profiting  from
the  ensuing panic.  Conscious  of the potential  advantages,  twelve  states have
enacted  product disparagement  laws.230  As  one  might  expect,  many observ-
ers  consider  such  laws  to  be  constitutionally  unacceptable  devices  designed
to  placate  powerful  economic  actors  intent on  suppressing  legitimate  doubts
about  the  safety  of their  products. 231  But  the  underlying  issues  are  more
complicated.  For  one thing,  it is unclear  that all  or most product  disparage-
ment  laws  violate  the  First  Amendment.  For  another,  their  beneficiaries
would hardly be limited to industries  trying to block reports  about the defects
of their  products.  Just  as  ordinary  libel  law  serves  to  discourage  public
falsehoods  about  individuals,  product  disparagement  laws  discourage  false
statements  about products.  In each  case, the  purpose  is  to  prevent  availabil-
ity cascades  from causing irreparable  damage.

In their current  form, food disparagement  laws apply  to perishable  foods
whose  producers  and sellers  could be ruined by  a cascade-induced  plunge in
demand.  As a  general  rule, the  laws  are narrowly  drawn,  allowing  compen-
satory  damages  only  for  spreading  known  falsehoods.  They  do  not  cover
negligent  falsehoods,  even  reckless  ones.  Nor  are  they  reasonably  inter-
preted to  cover hyperbole  or humor.  Thus the thirty-second  Honda  commer-
cial  that referred  to the  emus raised  in  Texas  as  "the pork of the  future"  did
not violate  any food  disparagement  law even  though  it temporarily  lowered
the demand  for emu meat.  And Oprah Winfrey  was acquitted  of the charges
brought  by  beef  producers,  apparently  for  lack  of  evidence  that  she  said
anything  she knew to be false.232

[Vol. 51:683

When  a product is "libeled,"  the news may spread  rapidly, bringing harm
to  a wide  range of people.  The best  (and constitutionally  mandated) remedy
for  false  speech,  it is  often  said,  is  more  speech. 2 3  Ordinarily  this  is  true.
Yet  when  an  availability  cascade  is  under  way,  the  liberty  to  counter  false
charges  will  not  necessarily  provide  a  corrective,  and  this  is  what  product
disparagement laws and ordinary libel laws acknowledge.

Indeed,  predictable  social  forces  may  reinforce  rather  than  dampen  sen-
sational  charges.  One  such  force  involves  the  mass  media.  The  typical
newspaper,  magazine,  or television station incurs a large penalty whenever it

falls behind  its rivals  in reporting  "breaking  news. '
tive  position  in  the media  hierarchy  translates  into  disproportionately  large
profit differentials,  a media outlet that exercises  caution  in reporting a fright-
ening story  may  find itself at  a huge,  possibly  irreversible,  competitive  dis-
advantage. 235  Facing  a  prisoner's  dilemma  with  respect  to  sensational  sto-
ries,  it  has  every  reason  to  compete  aggressively  to  report  sensationalistic
stories as rapidly as possible.  Another social force that reinforces  sensational
changes  consists  of reputational  pressures.  Evolving  reputational  pressures
can make it personally  costly for individuals  to  defend  a  disparaged product.
And  the  consequent  individual  reticence  may  contribute  to  the  growth and
spread of availability  errors.

To  the  extent  that  they  reach  only  intentional  falsehoods,  the  product
defamation  laws  appear  consistent  with  the  body  of libel  law  currently  ap-
plied  to  government  officials  and  well-known  figures.  Under  New  York
Times  Co. v.  Sullivan,236 it is  constitutionally  legitimate  for states  to require
compensation  for  libelous  statements  that  are  intentionally  false  or  made
with  reckless  disregard  for  the  truth.  The  rationale  here  is  that  the  reputa-
tional  interests  of individuals  are  sufficiently  strong  to  overcome  the  rela-
tively  weak free speech interests.  If states can prohibit intentional  or reckless
falsehoods  about  people,  perhaps  they  can  also  prohibit  intentional  false-
hoods  about  products.  This  logic  thus  makes  product  disparagement  laws
seem constitutional. 237

233.  The  idea  has its  roots  in  Whitney v.  California, 274  U.S.  357, 377  (1927)  (Brandeis,  J.,

concurring).

234.  See generally ROBERT H. FRANK  & PHILIP  J. COOK,  THE WiNNER-TAKE-ALL  SOCIETY
189-97  (1995)  (arguing that  in cultural markets  only  the most popular  works succeed,  and  that the
resulting  race to achieve quick success  affects supply decisions).

235.  See generally id. at  189-209.
236.  376 U.S. 254 (1964).
237.  It would even be possible  to suggest,  on  the basis of the  analysis here,  that recklessness
or even mere  negligence  ought to be enough for  liability with  respect  to either persons or products.
One  might  think that since availability  cascades  can do  so much  harm,  their instigators should  face
the  level  of deterrence  that comes  from  requiring  compensation  for all  negligent  falsehoods.  But
this  would  be  a  most  controversial  conclusion.  The  general  relationship  between  libel  law  and
freedom of speech raises conceptual  and  empirical  issues that we cannot take up here.

A VAILABILITY  CASCADES

Such  a  view  might  be  challenged  on  the  ground  that  products  are  not
people.  Only people  have feelings  that can  be hurt and  social positions  that
can be damaged, so  perhaps states  cannot legitimately base their product  dis-
paragement  laws  on  the  exceptionally  strong  interests  traditionally  used  to
support  the  law  of libel.  There  is  indeed  a  difference.  But  product  dispar-
agement laws  do not protect products  as  such.  When  citizens  are  frightened
through  false  statements  about products,  it is people  who  are  genuinely  in-
jured, sometimes  severely.  In fact, the  victims  may greatly  outnumber those
in  a typical  libel  case;  consider the  multitudes  of frightened parents  and  the
many millions  of dollars  lost  by  apple  growers  as  a  result  of the  Alar  epi-
sode.3 8  The  shareholders  of the  relevant  companies  and  their  employees
suffer, too, as do their customers;  and the  anxieties  caused by the  knowledge
of consumption  risks produce  a wide  range  of ancillary  social  harms.  As  a
case  in  point,  frightened  parents,  who  had  fed  their  children  apples  falsely
described  as  dangerously  carcinogenic,  unnecessarily  lost  sleep-a  large  if
difficult  to  measure  social  loss-and  they  had  to  have  their  children  tested
medically.  States  have  strong  reasons,  then,  to  permit  the  imposition  of
compensatory  damages  for intentional falsehoods  about products.

To  identify certain  advantages  of product  disparagement  laws  and to  de-
fend  their constitutionality is not, of course, to prove  that on balance they are
beneficial  or  desirable.  In  principle,  such  laws  could  encourage  frivolous
rather than meritorious  suits.  Even  more  seriously, they  could  deter reports
about  genuine  product  hazards.  Although  it  is  highly  desirable  to  allow
broad-ranging  debate  about  all potential  risks,  the mere  possibility  of a law-
suit  may  make knowledgeable  people  refrain  from  discussing  real  dangers,
with the net result being more,  not less, loss  of life.  The  possibility of frivo-
lous  lawsuits  might  be  attenuated  by  making  plaintiffs  liable  for  all  court
costs,  including the  attorneys'  fees, in the  event they  lose.  As for the  risk of
excessive deterrence,  it can be reduced  by  maintaining  a  sharp  line  between
the  communication  of intentional  falsehoods  and  legitimate  expressions  of
hyperbole,  doubt, and  concern.  But each reservation  constitutes an empirical
claim  to  be  tested  by  experience.  We  do  not  have  a  sufficient  basis  for
knowing  whether  the  existing  laws  are  too  broad.  In  the  present  state  of
knowledge,  it appears  at  least  as likely  that product  defamation  laws  would
do more  good than harm than the other way around.

C.  Congress

We  now  turn  to  the  core  institutions  of the  federal  government.  Con-
gress  is currently  quite vulnerable  to availability  cascades,  partly because  its
members  feel  compelled  to  respond  to  mass  demands  for  legislation  simply

238.  See Part I.B supra.

HeinOnline  -- 51 Stan. L. Rev. 751 1998-1999

STANFORD LA WREVIEW

[Vol. 51:683

to  keep  their  seats,  and partly because  they have  incentives  to  serve  as  avail-
ability  entrepreneurs  who  work  in  concert  with their  constituents  to  further
parochial  agendas.  As  an  institution,  Congress  is  poorly  equipped  to  place
risks  in  comparative  perspective. 
Its  committee  system  keeps  Congress
highly  balkanized  and  also  increases  its  susceptibility  to  short-term  pres-
sures.  Because  activities  of senators  and representatives  are  carefully scruti-
nized by directly  affected lobbies,  committee  members  are  often reluctant  to
publicize  information,  make  statements,  or  take  positions  that  can  be  used
against them at election  time.  As a case  in point, they rarely make public, let
alone endorse,  the monetary  values that potential  or actual policies  ascribe to
statistical  lives.  Nor  do  they  talk  candidly  about  trading  lives  for  money.
Committee  members thus  encourage  citizens  to  cling  to  the idea  that even  a
statistical  human  life  is  priceless.  One  consequence  is  that when  an  avail-
ability  cascade  fuels massive  demand  for acting  on  a matter  under the  com-
mittee's  purview,  the  members  of the  committee  quickly  yield,  and  legisla-
tive  action  follows  without  any  attempt  at  coordination  with  existing  poli-
cies.239

1.  Risk oversight.

A possible method for insulating  Congress from  such pressures  is to  cre-
ate a risk regulation committee  entrusted with compiling information  about a
wide  range  of risk  levels  and  empowered  to  set  priorities.  This  committee
would have  authority  over  both  substantive  statutes  and  the  appropriations
process.  It would  thus operate  as a check  on short-term  pressures by  putting
particular  concerns  in  a  broader  context. 
Its  basic  goal  would  be  to  rank
risks,  publicize  misallocations,  and  initiate  legislative  corrections. 
In  its
ideal form, the  committee  would  rely heavily  on prevailing  scientific  knowl-
edge.  At the  same  time,  it would  recognize  that risk judgments  and  prefer-
ences  constitute  legitimate  considerations  in  the  determination  of priorities
and  selection  of policies.  Thus,  its  essential  function  would  be  to  prevent
myopic,  unduly  quick,  and  poorly  reasoned  responses,  not  to  insulate  risk
regulation  from  evolving  social  values.  Helping  to  slow  down,  limit,  and
possibly even  prevent  availability  cascades,  the  committee's hearings  would
enable  Congress to  "strike  when the  iron is cold. 2 40

Like  any  government  body,  the  risk  regulation  committee  would  most
certainly become the  target of well-organized  lobbies  intent on molding poli-
cies to  their own  advantage.2 4 1  But it should  be possible  to  dampen  the  in-

239.  A  counteracting  factor  is that  the committee  chairs,  insofar  as  they  consider  their seats
secure, have  a long-term  interest  in maintaining  consistency across policies.  However,  even  where
this condition  is met, the chair may not be capable of blocking  the demands of the membership.

centives  for rent-seeking  by guaranteeing  that risks are  put in a  comparative
light.  The  very  act of comparing risks  and publicizing  the obtained  rankings
would  provide  a measure  of protection  against  well-organized  special  inter-
ests.  If the  social  costs of accommodating  a particular lobby's  demands  gain
widespread  recognition,  counter-lobbying  might  neutralize  this  lobby's  po-
litical effectiveness.

2.  Cost-benefit analysis.

Congress  has  debated a  number of bills  designed  to  require  agencies  to
engage  in  cost-benefit  analysis. 242  The  use  of cost-benefit  analysis  as  the
basis  for regulatory  decisions  has been  highly  controversial,  partly  because
of  conceptual  and  empirical  obstacles  to  quantifying  either  costs  or  bene-
fits, 2 43  and  partly  because  no  agency  is  widely  trusted  to  undertake  a  fair
analysis. 244  Although  we  cannot resolve  these  problems  here,  it is  clear that
availability  cascades  provide a new  and distinct reason for some kind of cost-
benefit mandate,  not as a way  of obtaining  an uncontroversial  assessment  of
policy  options,  not  as  the  foundation  for  every  decision,  and  not  because
economic  efficiency  is  the  only  legitimate  ground  for regulation,  but  as  an
instrument  for producing relevant  information  and  a common-sensical  brake
on measures  that would do little good and possibly considerable  harm.

Wherever  some  salient  event  might  cause  a  cascade  in  favor  of speedy
regulation,  there  are  good reasons  to  support mechanisms  that  help  identify
and quantify  actual risks,  and  also  for putting  "on  screen"  the  various  possi-
ble disadvantages  of attempting to  curb  them.245  Cost-benefit  analysis might
therefore  serve  as  a  check  on  ill-advised  availability  campaigns.  Consider,
for example, the  very different implications  of cost-benefit  analysis for a lead
phasedown  (amply justified) and  for eliminating  asbestos  (a  decidedly mixed
picture). 246  An  understanding  of availability  cascades  certainly  does  not es-
tablish  the  usefulness  of cost-benefit  analysis;  the  proof would  lie in  its  im-
plementation.  Yet  such  an  understanding  offers  a  new  basis  for requiring
cost-benefit  analysis  as a means of widening  the viewscreens  of political  ac-
tors and  containing  availability  errors.

D.  The Executive Branch

Other  possible  safeguards  against  harmful  availability  cascades  would
involve  the executive  branch,  which  is probably  in the  best position  to  ana-
lyze  risks  comprehensively. 247  Unlike  the  courts,  the  executive  branch  is
capable  of taking a  bird's eye  view of the  entire  regulatory  system;  and un-
like  Congress,  it  is  already  equipped  with  institutions  designed  to  promote
overall  consistency.  Obviously,  measures  adopted  by the  executive  branch
must be consistent with laws enacted by Congress;  in principle, therefore,  the
legislature  has  the  power  to  undermine  any  executive  initiative  to  place
regulations  on  more rational  footing.  Yet the  executive  branch  exercises  a
powerful influence  on public opinion, and it has considerable power to  act on
its own.

The  following  are  three  complementary  proposals,  each  of which  can

help prevent  cascades  driven by misperceptions.

1.  Peer review.

Several  recent  bills  would  require  executive  agencies  to  use  "peer  re-
view" as a means of corroborating  the evidence that underlies the regulations
they institute.248  Under peer review,  agency proposals are  subject to  scrutiny
by informed  outsiders.  Many  agencies  have already  experimented  with this
procedure.  The  argument  developed in this  article provides  systematic  rea-
sons for expanding the ongoing experiments.

The most  critical  function  of peer review  is  to  identify  and  correct mis-
perceptions  spread through availability  cascades.  While  an availability  cas-
cade is  in progress,  and  even  after it has run its  course, peer review  can pro-
vide  an  important  safeguard  against  policy  responses  that  the  facts  do  not
justify.  The  Love  Canal  and  Alar  scares  might  have  been  contained  at  an
early  stage  if the  underlying  claims  had  been  subjected  to  peer  review  in a
timely manner and the  findings  given wide publicity.2 49

247.  See BREYER,  supra note  65, at 59-67  (discussing risk  priority-setting  within  the execu-

tive branch).

248.  See SUNSTEIN,  supra note 242, at 366-67 (considering bills requiring peer review).
249.  It is not inconceivable that  the scientists themselves  would work  to advance, rather than
limit,  an availability  cascade  already  under way.  For  the same reasons  why nonscientists  seek  ref-
uge in preference  and  knowledge  falsification,  scientists  asked  to review  widely accepted  data  may
be  reluctant  to raise  questions  if their  identity  is  to become public  knowledge.  There  are  advan-
tages,  therefore,  to  providing  the  selected  scientists  anonymity.  But  even  anonymity  would  not
guarantee objectivity  of the reviews.  Scientists  have biases  of their own,  and they may pursue  per-
sonal agendas.  Nor are  they immune  to cognitive  biases.  In certain contexts  where predictability  is
particularly  low,  experts  equipped  with  scientific  models  tend  to  display  greater  overconfidence
than laypeople  who  understand  how  little they  know.  For  an  overview  of this  finding  and  many
relevant  references,  see Matthew  Rabin,  Psychology and Economics, 36 J. ECON.  LITERATuRE  11,
31-32 (1998).  Another potential problem  lies with  the possibility  of mistrust:  For reasons  unrelated

2.  Risk Information Site on the World Wide  Web.

Among  the  reasons  why  people  turn  to  nonexperts  for  information  on
various  risks is  that they  lack easy  access  to  statistically  accurate  and  scien-
tifically  up-to-date  judgments.  This  handicap  limits  their capacity  to  com-
pare risks  and develop  sound understandings  of dangers  associated  with, for
example,  air travel,  automobile  driving, poor diet, electromagnetic  fields, and
infrequent  exercise.  To  be  sure,  most  such  information  may  be  found  in
publications  shelved  in  any good library  or bookstore.  Alas,  people  seeking
to educate  themselves might have to read dozens of books to make the neces-
sary comparisons.  In  addition, they would first have to  identify the  appropri-
ate  sources  and  learn  how  to  standardize  disparate  pieces  of information.
There  exist  large  potential  gains,  then,  from  making  the  most  current  and
scientifically  most credible  information  easily  accessible to the widest possi-
ble  audience.  In  the  computer  age, the  Internet  may  serve  as  the  requisite
medium.2 50

We propose  the  creation  of a central  Risk Information Site (RIS)  on  the
World  Wide  Web.  This  site would  list various  risks  and  identify  the prob-
abilities,  or range  of probabilities,  associated  with each  of them.  The  tech-
nology  of the  web  allows  the  nesting of multiple  levels  of detail.  The most
elementary  level  ought  to  be  extremely  simple  to  follow-simple  enough,
perhaps,  for  a  high-school  student to  check  the  latest  scientific  knowledge
on, say, the  risks associated  with Alar  or Love  Canal; below this layer would
lie progressively  more  sophisticated  layers,  each  accessible  at the  click of a
mouse.  Where  the  scientific  community  is  divided  on  a particular  risk  as-
sessment, as it is on the thinning  of the ozone  layer, the  RIS should make the
substance  of the  controversy  as  clear as possible,  allowing  websurfers  to re-
view the  opposing arguments.  The  proposed website  could  be designed  and
operated  by  a  nongovernmental  Risk  Information Center (RIC),  along  the
lines  of Consumer Reports.  It could  even be  a profit-oriented  enterprise;  af-
ter all,  there  exist profit-driven  credit bureaus  that enjoy  an exemplary  repu-
tation because  they have a stake  in their maintenance. 2 1  Only if no  nongov-

to the case at hand,  nonscientists may lack  trust in the scientific  community.  This possibility  could
be  minimized  by  selecting  reviewers  from  among  members  of the  scientific  community  who  are
respected  for their  integrity.  If the peer review  process  falls  into  disrepute,  nonscientists  will turn
elsewhere for information, thus becoming more susceptible to availability  errors.

250.  Information  posted  on  the  Internet  could  also  be  made  available  in  print.  However,
given  the speed  at which  cascades  often develop,  the Internet  offers  obvious  advantages  to  both
information  disseminators  and  information  seekers  at  times  when  a  frightening  claim  suddenly
catches widespread  attention.

251.  See Daniel  B. Klein,  Promise Keeping in the Great Society: A  Model of Credit Informa-
tion Sharing, 4  ECoN.  & POt.  117,  121-23  (1992).  See  generally REPUTATION:  STUDIES  IN  THE
VOLUNTARY  ELICITATION  OF  GOOD CONDUCT  (Daniel  B.  Klein ed.,  1997).  These studies  do not
show  that credit  bureaus  are  infallible.  Just as  Consumer Reports makes  mistakes, so  do other in-
formation providers.  The point remains  that they provide generally  very valuable information.

ernmental  entity  is  willing  or  able  to  undertake  the  task should  the  federal
government take  the lead, because  a government-operated  RIC would have a
harder  time rising above partisan politics  and establishing its trustworthiness.
Counteracting  the  irrational  attitudes  and  counterproductive  policy  de-
mands  caused by cognitive  biases and distortions  of public  discourse,  an RIS
would  help  individuals  form  their  risk preferences  and judgments  more ra-
tionally  than  is  currently  possible.25 2  The  RIS  would also  offer  information
on how  other countries are  dealing with particular risks, thus  alerting people
to possible  over-  or  under-reactions.  It might allow  parties  to a  controversy
to  make their case as well as rebut their opponents.  Had an RIS  existed dur-
ing the  Love  Canal  episode,  both Lois  Marie  Gibbs  and her skeptics  within
the  scientific  world  might  have  been  given  opportunities  to  post  evidence
supporting  their  respective  cases  as  well  as  their  reasons  for  doubting  the
opposing  account.  Equally  important,  the  proposed  RIS  would  feature  sys-
tematic  information  on  possible  discrepancies  between  public  and  private
opinion  on ongoing controversies.  To this  end, it would  post controlled  sur-
veys  that  give  people  anonymity  along  with  ones  that  deliberately  do  not.
These  surveys  would  serve  to  identify  hidden  currents  of opinion  and  unar-
ticulated  insights,  thus  strengthening  individual  resistance  to  the  biases  of
public  discourse and the  social pressures  stemming from public  opinion.  An
even more  ambitious  enterprise  would  be  to  include  information  about  the
objectives  of all groups  with a stake  in regulating particular risks.  One could
also publicize  analyses of their political strategies. 25 3

In  a  world  in  which  highly  trusted  scientists  quickly  evaluate  all  per-
ceived  risks  and  post  their  findings  in  comprehensible  form  on  a  widely
known  website,  availability  errors  of the  kinds  that  motivated  this  article
would be less  likely to develop than they currently do.  Were a news program
to  claim  that  apples  carry  a  deadly  poison,  people  could  check  the  RIS  to
learn  what is  known about the  identified risk.  If scientific tests  suggested an
infinitesimal  risk, fewer  people  would believe  the  claim,  and  no  major  cas-
cade would follow.  It is possible, of course, for credible tests to be nonexist-
ent.  In this  event,  the RIC,  or possibly  some  other  organization  such as  the
one  we will  propose next, would  immediately  undertake  new tests  to evalu-
ate  the  claim.  If the  claim  proved  groundless,  a  possibly  costly  cascade
would be prevented without involving the courts.

Obviously,  even  the most  elaborate RIS  cannot prevent  every potentially
destructive  availability  cascade.  For  one  thing,  just  as  some  car  buyers
would  rather  seek  guidance  from  their  acquaintances  than  from  Consumer

252.  BREYER,  supra note  65,  offers  many  examples  of preferences  and judgments  based  on

erroneous  information.

253.  These groups  would include, in addition to availability entrepreneurs  committed  to "con-
sciousness  raising"  with  respect  to threats  to  the environment,  hospitals  and  insurance  companies
with incentives  to downplay evidence of danger.

Reports, many people  would not consult the RIS.  In addition,  even highly-
educated  people  can  be influenced  by  empirically  baseless  claims,  and  cer-
tain  people  have strong  incentives  to  exploit this  gullibility;  witness  the  nu-
merous promoters of accounts  involving  flying saucers  and alien abductions,
and  the  millions  of Americans  who  take  these  accounts  seriously.  Never-
theless,  an RIS could  certainly help  at the margin.  Insofar as  the RIS  makes
a difference,  it would  limit  the need  for speech-restricting  measures  such  as
the food disparagement  laws discussed above.

3.  Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.

In  1981,  President  Reagan  created  a new  agency,  an  Office  of Informa-
tion  and  Regulatory  Affairs  (OIRA)  within  the  Office  of Management  and
Budget, to  oversee risk regulation  in an effort  to  ensure  coordination  and ra-
tionality. 5 4  Since  that time,  the  functions  of OIRA  have  changed.  Under
Presidents  Reagan  and  Bush,  OIRA  operated  essentially  as  a  "cost-benefit"
monitor that  intervened  in  an  ad hoc  way to  force  reconsideration  of ineffi-
s5  President  Clinton,  who  has taken  steps  of
cient  or excessive  regulations
his  own to  "reinvent  government"2 56 so  as to  ensure  greater  attention  to  re-
sults than to processes, has de-emphasized  this particular function.25 7

In  view  of  the  dangers  of  availability  (and  unavailability)  cascades,
OIRA  should  be  reinvigorated  and  its  powers  extended  and  strengthened.
This  measure  would  serve  to  deter  unreasonable  regulations.  Specifically,
the  OIRA  should  have,  and be known  to  have,  authority  over  both priority-
setting and  cost-benefit  balancing.  It  should be committed  to mitigating  the
most  unfortunate  effects  of availability  cascades,  not only  by  keeping  small
risks  from  consuming  huge  resources,  but also  by  ensuring  that major  risks
receive  attention.  Where  experts  working  under OIRA  lacked  confidence  in
risk judgments  spreading through  a cascade,  they would  conduct  fact-finding
exercises.  And, depending  on  the results,  they would  publicize  any inaccu-
racies  in popular beliefs.  Likewise,  where  a scientific  study suggested  that a
particular risk judgment should be revised,  OIRA would examine the  study's
methodology,  check  whether its results  can be replicated,  and disseminate  its
findings.  OIRA's  mission  should also  include  the  dissemination  of system-
atic  information  about risks, including  changes  in what scientists know about
particular risks and the methods  for controlling  them.  Finally, it should con-

tion unless the benefits outweigh  the costs to society).

duct  systematic  comparisons  with  other  countries  in  the  interest  of finding
cross-country  differences  that might provide  clues  to  misperceptions  or pol-
icy flaws  at home.  OIRA  could  constitute one  of the  information sources  for
the RIS discussed above.

If it proves  infeasible  to redesign  OIRA  along the proposed lines,  and its
role  remains  very  limited,  one  might  establish  an  alternative  institution  to
publicize  the  inconsistencies  of the  prevailing  regulatory  system  and  focus
attention  on  the  most  serious  risks.  United  States  Supreme  Court  Justice
Stephen Breyer  has suggested  assembling  a  multidisciplinary  group  of well-
trained  risk  managers,  which  would  be  authorized  to divert  resources  from
small  problems  to large  ones.25 8  Justice  Breyer's  suggestion  is  largely  con-
sistent  with  our discussion.  A "Breyer  Group"  within  the  executive branch
could undertake  the  types  of analyses  and  educational  activities  we are  pro-
posing  here.  The  group  would  have  the  authority  to  publicize  its  findings
about the relative  seriousness  of risks, require agencies to  seek  consistency in
setting  their priorities,  and  recommend  changes  in  statutes,  regulations,  and
even  appropriations.  A  Breyer  Group might  even  be  empowered  to  under-
take  certain resource  reallocations  on  its  own.  Our  difference  from  Justice
Breyer,  which  is  perhaps  only  one  of emphasis,  lies  in  our view  that  risk
evaluation  has nontechnical  dimensions that may  require  democratically  de-
termined  risk  policies  to  diverge  from  the  types  of risk  rankings  currently
fashionable  in scholarly  circles.25 9

E.  Courts

Courts,  too,  have  a  role  to  play  in  preventing  excessive  reactions  to
availability  cascades.  Most naturally,  they  can  undertake judicial  review  of
administrative  actions  alleged  to  be  "arbitrary"  or  "capricious"  within  the
meaning  of the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  (APA).2 60  The  ban  on  arbi-
trary  or capricious  action  is increasingly  being understood  as requiring  agen-
cies  to  produce  plausible  evidence  that  their  actions  produce  "more  good
than  harm. '261  This notion  appears  to  embody  a presumptive  requirement
that costs not be grossly  disproportionate  to benefits. 262  Thus,  existing  doc-

AVAILABILITY  CASCADES

trine  authorizes  courts  to  invalidate  the  most  extreme  and  the  most  poorly
conceived  regulatory  proposals,  at  least  if they  are  not required by  statutes.
Courts  can hardly  be expected  to  identify  availability  cascades  or to  invali-
date  regulatory  initiatives  merely  for  being  products  of cascades.  But  if
regulators  are  required  to  demonstrate  that  their  policies  would  plausibly
make things better rather than worse, taking account of all relevant variables,
we will have a potentially valuable safeguard  against harmful  cascades.

Ordinarily,  the  reach  of the  doctrine  of "more  good  than  harm"  is  lim-
ited.  But in contexts  in which an availability cascade produces a sudden out-
cry  for  costly  action  against  an  actually  small  but allegedly  grave  risk,  this
doctrine  can  provide  courts  considerable  authority.  At  a minimum,  it pro-
hibits  regulations  that  rest  on  unfounded  perceptions  about health  risks.263
Courts might also use  the doctrine  as an interpretive principle  in dealing  with
ambiguous  statutes;  specifically,  the  principle  would  allow  agencies  to  ex-
empt de  minimis risks,  and perhaps  require them  to  do so,  on  analogy  to  the
common law  maxim that absurdity  in  interpretation  will be  avoided 64  The
doctrine  of more  good than harm entails  a requirement  that agencies  be per-
mitted  to  engage in  "health-health"  analysis  where  they see fit, ensuring  that
regulations  do not  create  health  problems  more  serious  than  those  they  are
intended to  alleviate.26  Certain policy responses  to  availability cascades  will
be found to  fail health-health analysis. 266

Finally,  the  "more  good than harm"  doctrine  entails  a mandate  that, un-
der  the APA,  agencies  undergoing  arbitrariness  review  should  make  a plau-
sible  showing that a regulation's  costs are  not grossly disproportionate  to  its
benefits.  We  have  said  that  our  analysis  makes  a  cognitive  case  for  cost-
benefit  analysis  as  a  safeguard  against  socially  destructive  availability  cas-
cades.  If availability  and unavailability  cascades  can  divert  attention  from
important questions,  then a broader reason exists for thinking that some  form
of cost-benefit  analysis can do some good.267

F.  Summary: Revisiting the Cases

By  way  of summary,  let  us  explore  how  the  availability  cascades  dis-
cussed  early in the  article  might have  fared had  the relevant institutional  re-
forms  been in place.  The  proposals that  followed the  terrorism-related  con-
cerns  involving  TWA  800268  are  probably  the  easiest  to  reconsider  in  this
light.  Most would not have  survived cost-benefit  analysis.  Studies probably
would have  shown  that, in encouraging  driving by raising  the cost of flying,
the  proposals  would not  have  enhanced  overall  safety  and  might  well  have
harmed  it.269  Our  reforms  would  have  had  the  same  function  as  an  earlier
use  of cost-benefit  analysis,  which tested a proposal  to make  young airplane
passengers  fly  in  their  own  child  safety  seats.270  In that  case,  cost-benefit
analysis  revealed  that such  a restriction would cost rather than save  lives  (by
encouraging  driving),  and this finding helped  defeat the proposal.

The  Alar  case 271 could have  been  subjected  to  an  analogous  test.  Peer
review and cost-benefit  analysis  would have revealed the NRDC report to be
vastly exaggerated,  helping  to  alleviate the  rapidly spreading  fears.  Perhaps
by  the time  official  investigations  were  completed  and their  findings  publi-
cized,  the  rapid  cascade  would  already  have  forced  apple  growers  to  cease
using  Alar.  However,  government  officials,  relying  on  information  from
OIRA  and  the  proposed  Risk  Information  Center,2 72  could  have  provided
more forceful reassurances  than they actually  did.  In the  Love  Canal case, 273
a congressional  risk  oversight  committee  might well have  restricted  the size
of Superfund.  It could  have  shown  that even  if it is  appropriate  for  the  fed-
eral  government  to  commit  itself  to  cleaning  abandoned  hazardous  waste
dumps,  devoting billions of taxpayer  dollars to the cause was indefensible.

The reforms  we advocate  would  thus  have protected  society against  leg-
islative misallocations  while  offering  the  executive  branch  a  greater role  in
priority-setting.  The  government  would  have  been  able  to  reallocate  re-
sources  earmarked  for  abandoned  hazardous  waste  dumps  to  more  serious
risks such as cancer  and asthma.

A VAILABILITY  CASCADES

CONCLUSIONS  AND EXTENSIONS

In this article, we have tried to substantiate  the  following claims:
1. In  a broad  array  of contexts  that call  for risk judgments,  individuals
lack  reliable  or  first-hand  knowledge. 
In  such  contexts,  they  assess
probabilities  with  the  help  of  the  availability  heuristic. 
Insofar  as  this
heuristic  influences  the  information  that  individuals  store,  retrieve,  and
process,  it  interacts  with  all  other  judgmental  heuristics  and  with  all
cognitive  biases that distort their judgments.

2.  The  availability  heuristic,  which  has  been  studied  in  isolation,  is
frequently  amplified  by socially  shaped  informational  cues  and  reputational
incentives.  People often  believe  something  because  others  appear  to believe
it;  or they feign conviction to  avoid reputational  harm.

3.  The  informational  and  reputational  processes  that  shape  public
discourse  ordinarily  feed  on  one  another.  Under  the right  conditions,  they
generate  availability  cascades  that spread  and worsen misperceptions.  As  a
result,  the  perceived  collective  wisdom  may  bear  little,  if any,  relation  to
reality.

4.  Availability  entrepreneurs  try  to trigger  availability  cascades  likely to
advance  their  causes,  and  they  work  to  extend  those  already  in  progress.
Acting  selfishly  or  altruistically,  they  focus  attention  on  isolated  events,
select  information  to  support  their  preferred  interpretations,  and  make
anyone  who questions their objectives appear ignorant,  duped, or depraved.

5.  Insofar as the availability  heuristic helps  shape individual perceptions,
public  opinion  about  the  relative  magnitudes  of risks  will  exhibit  multiple
expressive  equilibria.  This implies  the possibility  of sudden  shifts  in public
discourse  on  any  given  matter  (as  with  the  eruption  of mass  anxiety  over
toxic  waste  sites  in  the  1970s),  inconsistencies  across  contexts  (as  with the
huge attention  paid to  the  dangers  of Alar  when more  significant  sources  of
risk, such as poor diet and insufficient  exercise,  received little  attention),  and
discrepancies  across  countries  at  any  given  time  (as  with  policies  with
respect to  nuclear  power, which  is  considered  a much more  serious threat  in
the United States than in Europe).

6.  Availability  cascades  should  be an  important  element  in the positive
analysis  of  legislation  and  regulation.  An  emphasis  on  interest-group
pressures  alone,  or  the  availability  heuristic  standing  by  itself,  leaves
important gaps  in understanding.

formidable  political  pressures 

7.  Availability  cascades  that  spread  empirically  baseless  information
create 
and
counterproductive  regulations.  These  pressures  might  be  mitigated  by
equipping  the  political  system  with  "circuit  breakers"  to  slow  availability
cascades  and  encourage  the  reconsideration  of  the  demands  they  spawn.

[Vol.  51:683

Without  removing  the  right  to  select  risk policies  democratically,  all  three
branches  of  government  should  be  enabled  to  resist  demands  driven  by
misinformation  about risks and to seek  consistency among risk policies.

Our  starting  point  has  been  that  people  often  lack relevant  knowledge,
even  with respect  to matters  of great  importance  to  them,  and  even  if their
convictions  are  intensely  held.  On  matters  ranging  from  the health  conse-
quences  of sugar and coffee  consumption  to  the  risks of automobile  driving,
nuclear  power,  global  warming,  asthma,  and  thinning  of the  ozone  layer,
each  of us depends  for information  on what other people  seem to know, even
as  others  are  relying at least partly  on us.  We  have sought  to show  how the
availability  heuristic  interacts  with  informational  and  reputational  motiva-
tions to  create pervasively held social judgments rooted in  cascades.

Because  people  routinely  use the  availability  heuristic  in trying to  make
sense  of reality,  there  is  a  danger  of widespread  and persistent  mispercep-
tions  about risks.  To  be  sure,  an  availability  cascade  that  reshapes  public
discourse  may  be  socially  beneficial;  the  transformation  can  draw  overdue
attention  to  neglected  problems.  But  there  is  no  guarantee  that  the  effects
will be beneficial;  socially  damaging  availability  errors  cannot  be ruled  out.
A  major  challenge  for  any  democratic  system  is  to  institute  safeguards
against harmful  cascades.  We  have  suggested  that a  modest but potentially
appropriate  response  is  to  create  disincentives  against  efforts  to  instigate
mass  scares  by propagating  knowing  falsehoods.  We  have  also  suggested,
less  modestly,  that  each  of  the  three  branches  of American  government
should be reformed  in order to  create protections  against  the  adverse  effects
of availability  cascades.  Our  analysis  indicates  that peer  review  and  cost-
benefit  analysis  should  be  encouraged  as  checks  against  misperceptions
rooted  in interdependent  learning  and preference  falsification.

Availability  cascades  are by no means new, but modem communications
enable  them  to  gather  momentum  and  overwhelm  governments  far  more
rapidly than  was possible  in the  past.  Fortunately,  the  very technologies  re-
sponsible for this transformation present new tools for lessening the potential
dangers.  Most  promisingly,  a  trusted  Risk  Information  Site  on  the  World
Wide  Web  could  make  the  latest  information  on  a  wide  variety  of hazards
instantly  available  to  anyone  with  access  to  a  computer.  This  site  would
educate  people  not only  on  the  magnitudes  and  characteristics  of particular
risks  but  also  on  discrepancies  between  private  and  public  opinion  about
relevant controversies.

A  broader  educational  mission  would  be  to  disseminate  information
about  the  mechanics  and  implications  of  availability  cascades. 
Insofar  as
people appreciate the  mechanisms  discussed here, they  will know that public
opinion can  be both misinformed  and  deceptive.  As  Alexis  de  Tocqueville
recognized,  the notion  that the majority  is not necessarily right  collides with
one of the  building  blocks  of modem  democracy:  the principle  of majority

rule.274  To  ascribe  moral  authority  to  numbers is  to  instruct  individuals  that
if they  are  outnumbered  they  are  likely  to  be wrong  and  deserving  of criti-
cism.  It is also to  signal to the  majority that it has a moral  right to intimidate
dissenters.  As  compared  with people  socialized  to  believe  in  the  virtues  of
majority  rule,  those  who  understand  the  mechanics  and  consequences  of
availability cascades  will be more resistant to  their informational  and reputa-
tional signals.

Availability  cascades  can arise  with respect  to  any issue  on which  large
numbers  of people  have limited  knowledge.  Consider  the  controversy  over
reforming  social  welfare programs.  Most  Americans  are  uninformed  about
the  details  of these  programs;  few  people  know  the  percentage  of welfare
recipients  who  live  in  cities  and  how long  beneficiaries  generally  remain  on
welfare.  Whatever  the  merits  of tightening  welfare  eligibility requirements,
activists  on all  sides  of the  controversy  help  shape  public discourse  both  by
disseminating  biased information  and by  vilifying their opponents.  President
Reagan,  a master at using modem technologies  to  exploit people's  use of the
availability  heuristic, played  a leading role  in reorienting  public discourse  on
welfare,  above  all  through  sharp  anecdotes  that made honest  taxpayers  con-
sider  the  system  unfair;  one  such  anecdote  was  the  tale  of the  chauffeur-
driven  "welfare  queen"  who makes  a  fortune  without working.27 5  President
Reagan  also  succeeded  in  painting  the  supporters  of welfare  as  "tax-and-
spend  liberals"  uninterested  in  promoting  a  sense  of personal  responsibil-
ity.276

The  debate preceding  the  Gulf War of 1991  provides  another instructive
example  from  national  politics.  People  on  both  sides  of the  debate  recog-
nized that  their  cause  would benefit by  framing  the  issue  appropriately  and
exploiting  the availability  heuristic.  Pro-interventionists  sought  to raise  the
availability  of images  of the Korean  War, which  is  widely  believed  to have
inhibited  the  spread  of  communism;  anti-interventionists  reminded  Ameri-
cans  of the  Vietnam  War,  generally  remembered  as  a  death trap born  out of
miscalculation,  ignorance,  and  self-serving  exaggeration  of  the  stakes  in-

The explosion  of federal  and state legislation to  combat "hate crimes"  of-
fers  another  instructive  example.  This  legislative  campaign  is  being  spear-
headed  by  availability  entrepreneurs  who  publicize  major  crimes  against
gays and ethnic  minorities  to paint a picture  of a virulent "epidemic"  of such
crimes  and to  signal  that  the  campaign's  opponents  show  insensitivity  to  a
horrible  social  problem.278  Their  campaign  for hate  crimes  legislation  went
into  high  gear  in  mid-1998  after  a  racially-motivated  murder  in  Jasper,
Texas. 279  Proponents  argued  that  this  murder  confirms  the  persistence  of
racial  violence  and the  need  for extraordinary  measures  to combat  the prob-
lem.  Opponents  of such  legislation  sought to  use the  same  tragedy  to  dem-
onstrate  the lack of a need for  special  legislation.  Jasper  united in condem-
nation of the  crime, they noted,  and the police quickly  caught the suspects. 280
Salient news sometimes  becomes  the focus  of availability  campaigns  de-
signed to achieve political outcomes that would otherwise be unattainable.  A
coalition  of celebrities  used  Princess  Diana's  death  during  a high-speed  es-
cape  from tabloid journalists  to make  a  case  for stronger protections  against
invasions of their privacy.  The leading  availability  entrepreneurs  of this  epi-
sode were the Screen Actors  Guild and Senator Diane Feinstein;  they tried to
capitalize  on  the  sympathy  that  this  tragic  death  evoked  by publicizing  the
dark  side  of tabloid journalism  and  vilifying  tabloid journalists  in  order  to
catalyze  an  availability  cascade  in  favor  of new restrictions  on media  activi-
ties.2 1

There  are  also groups  that work to prevent potentially  salient  events ca-
pable of producing availability  cascades  inimical  to their legislative  agendas.
In  1998,  a  group  of Greek-Americans  organized  a  campaign  that  induced  a
famous  actor  to  give up  the  lead role  in a  high-budget  film  about the  life  of
Mustafa  Kemal Atatfirk,  the  founder  of modem Turkey. 2 2  Even  though the
period  when Atatfirk held  Turkey's  presidency  is  remembered  as the golden
age  of  modem  Turkish-Greek  relations,  the  campaigners,  who  condemned
Atatiirk for  actions they  perceived  as  evil,  feared  the film  would  depict him
favorably. 2 3  They also feared  that  a reverential  portrayal  in a major Holly-
wood production would improve  popular feelings toward  Turkey, which they
considered  a threat  to Greek interests.2 4  One  of their justifications  was  that
the  probable  transformation  of public  opinion  would  alter the  political  bal-

ance  in  Washington  with regard  to  laws  and policies  of interest  to  the  two
mother countries  and their  ethnic  communities  in  the  United States.28S  An-
other  was  that  the  film  would  influence  legislative  battles  raging  in  many
state and local governments over  guidelines  for teaching history.2 86

Availability cascades  are relevant not only  to routine legislative  struggles
but also  to  the making  and exercise  of constitutional  law.  Consider  first the
matter  of constitutional  design.  The rules  for constitution-making  and  con-
stitution-amending 2 7 provide  safeguards  against bad cascades.  In particular,
they  call  for  extended  deliberation  to  prevent  rushed,  myopic,  or  misin-
formed judgments.  Proposed  amendments  succeed  only by  surviving  a com-
plex  process  of "peer  review"  by  many people  in  various  institutional  set-
tings.288  Like the  rules that govern  constitutional  design, the checks  and bal-
ances  of the  Constitution  are  designed  to  counteract  the  potentially  destruc-
tive  social  forces  that we have  highlighted  here.2 9  So  understood,  the  pre-
vailing  constitutional  limits  to  rapid  decisionmaking  hardly  constitute  un-
democratic  obstacles  to  implementation  of the popular will.  On the  contrary,
they are instruments to  improve the workings  of democracy  in the light of the
inescapable  cognitive  limitations  of individual  citizens  and their susceptibil-
ity to  social pressures. 2 0

The  courts  are  not  immune  to  the  social  mechanisms  examined  in  this
article.  Judges  are  subject  to  the  availability  heuristic,  vulnerable  to  infor-
mational  biases,  and  responsive  to  reputational  incentives.  All  this  leaves
them  open to  the  influences  of availability  cascades.291  Occasionally,  a sin-
gle  legal  decision-for  example,  Dred  Scott  v.  Sandford,292  Plessy  v.
Ferguson,293  Lochner v. New  York,294 Brown v.  Board of Education,29s Roe v.

285.  Certain  Greek-Americans  have  opposed  the  campaign  against  the  film on  the  grounds
that knowledge  about  a period  of Turkish-Greek  rapprochment  would cool  current  intercommunal
tensions.  See  id.  It is  significant  that both proponents  and  opponents  of the  campaign  rest  their
cases on expectations  concerning  the consequences  of altering  the availability  of information  about
Atatilrk.

Wade296-comes 
to  signal  how  an  entire  area  of law  should  be  understood.
By virtue  of the  salience  it acquires,  it conveys  a relatively  simple  moral  or
institutional  lesson.  For precisely this  reason,  individuals  with  strong  views
on a possible, pending,  or actual legal decision  try to show that it is, or could
become,  "another  Lochner, ....  another  Brown,"  or  "another  Roe."  Social
struggles  over the meaning  of great legal  cases  should be  understood in  this
light.

Brown  was  exceedingly  controversial  in  the  late  1950s  and  early
1960s, 297  but  its defenders  put  in motion  an  availability  cascade  that  com-
pleted its course around  1980.298  Since that time, to say that Brown was mis-
guided,  or even  to  question  its  merits,  has  been  to risk  serious  reputational
damage,  even  ostracism from legal  circles.  Part  of Brown's significance  lies
in its  demonstrated  power to trigger  subsidiary  availability cascades,  such  as
those  that  have  made  discrimination  on the  basis  of sex  and  alienage  seem
"like"  racial segregation. 299

The  evolution  of the American  legal  community's  understanding  of Roe
v.  Wade  offers  an  example  of concurrent  and  competing  local availability
cascades.  In principle,  Roe may be treated  as either "another  Brown" or "an-
other Lochner."  Through  the mutually reinforcing  reputational  and informa-
tional  mechanisms  discussed  here,  large  segments  of the  legal  community
have  come  to  perceive  it  as  "another  Lochner."  Within these  circles,  a  de-
fense  of Roe triggers  reputational  sanctions.  These  circles  co-exist with oth-
ers,  within  which one incurs reputational  punishments  for challenging rather
than  defending  Roe.  Within  each  of these  rival  camps,  perceptual  interde-
pendencies  are  clearly  at work.  Their members  consider Roe right or wrong
partly,  if not largely,  on  the  basis  of what  their  co-members  generally  seem
to believe. 00  As with Brown, the social  forces  at work have spillover  effects
in  other  areas.  Roe's  controversial  status  may  have  initiated  a  powerful
availability  cascade  that predisposes judges not to  extend  constitutional  pro-
tections to  new rights  claimed to  be part  of constitutionally protected privacy
or liberty.  It may  even  have helped make the Supreme  Court less inclined  to

298.  The watershed was  the election of Reagan as  President and the ensuing recomposition of
the Supreme  Court.  As  a result of these changes,  litigants  became  more cautious  in attempting  to
seek social  engineering  through constitutional  law and,  hence,  less  likely  to claim  that  their  case
should be regarded as  "another Brown."

A VAILABILITY  CASCADES

treat the "right"  to physician-assisted  suicide as a constitutional  right, lest the
judgment create "another Roe."30'

Availability  cascades  can  help  or  hinder  the  tasks  of  governance  by
shaping  social  norms  and  determining  compliance  levels.  Behavioral  re-
search  shows  that changes  in  the  availability  of information  about  compli-
ance  with  a  prevailing  norm  often  influence  the  extent  to  which  it  is  fol-
lowed.  For  instance,  taxpayers  are  far  more  likely  to  comply  with  the pre-
vailing  tax  laws  if they  believe  that most people  fulfil  their tax  obligations
than if they  think that noncompliance  is widespread. 30 2  Another  example  is
the  problem  of drinking  on college  campuses.  Students  who  "binge  drink"
tend  to  overestimate  the  number  of binge  drinkers;  when  informed  of the
actual  numbers,  they  are  less  likely to  continue  this  self-destructive  and  so-
cially  harmful  behavior.30 3  The  tax  evasion  and  binge  drinking  examples
suggest that undesirable  behaviors  may  be curbed  simply by  controlling  the
information  available  to  the  relevant  actors,  or alternatively,  correcting  the
availability  errors  that  contribute  to  the  conduct.  Each  of these  cases  also
shows  that  the  availability  of  information  about  compliance  levels  affects
behavior  through two  channels:  by  signaling what is  socially  acceptable  and
by providing  clues as to  one's  own interests.  Laws  that have produced com-
pliance  with little or no enforcement,  such as those  that relegate  smoking to
designated  areas and require people to  clean up after their dog,  have much to
do with the informational and reputational  mechanisms discussed  above.3 °4

Our arguments here  constitute  a challenge  to both the  economic  analysis
of law and branches  of cognitive  psychology  that are  beginning  to influence
legal  scholarship.30 5  With  few  exceptions,  economists  have  ignored  critical
interdependencies  that  govern  people's  preferences,  choices,  and  beliefs;
even  the public  choice  school,  which  focuses  on  the  sources  of legislation,
typically  neglects  the  interdependencies  at  the  heart  of our  argument  here.
Yet,  as  we  have  emphasized,  there  is  no  inherent  conflict  between  the  ra-
tional  actor  framework  and  the  mechanisms  that  this  article  has  high-

lighted.30 6  Indeed,  certain economists,  along with legal  scholars  interested in
economics,  have  derived  valuable  insights  by  recognizing  that  utility-
maximizing  individuals  are also  social beings  who care about status and look
to others  for knowledge. 30 7  For their part, cognitive  psychologists have made
large  contributions  to  our  understanding  of information-processing  mecha-
nisms.  But  they  have  done  so  without  examining  how  these  cognitive
mechanisms  interact  with  the  social  construction,  communication,  and  sup-
pression  of knowledge;  and this tendency  has carried  over  to  the areas  of le-
gal scholarship  that make use of cognitive psychology. 308

This  article  has  shown  that  social  processes  compound  the  effects  of
cognitive  heuristics  and biases,  the importance  of which  may appear  trivial
when individual  decisions  are observed in isolation.  It has also demonstrated
that the  interactions  in  question  affect  the  content  of law  in important ways.
The  challenge  for the  future  is  to  translate  our  understanding  of availability
cascades  into  improvements  of a regulatory  system  that remains  so  vulner-
able to them.
