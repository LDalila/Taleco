      <p>Our system of government is ineffective, inefficient, and undemocratic.
Current institutions are the source of these problems. Without great
difficulty, legal reforms could dramatically improve these institutions.</p>
      <p>I propose three such reforms. First, government should rely much
more than it does now on the provision of information, on disclosure,
and on education. Second, economic incentives should replace the
command-and-control regulation that has become so characteristic of our
governmental institutions. Third, the law should promote more
decentralization in the private and public spheres, allowing greater flexibility
for states and localities, for employers, and for workers.</p>
      <p>In recent decades, prescriptions of this general sort have been set out
by economists with considerable care and clarity. There can be no doubt
that legal initiatives in these directions would increase the efficiency of
contemporary government; they would also help guarantee that
regulation is actually effective in accomplishing its goals. These would be large
improvements, especially in a period in which American industries must
compete in increasingly international markets. I will therefore devote
considerable attention to explaining how efficiency and efficacy might be
brought about by legal reforms.</p>
      <p>It is important to emphasize, however, that we are in the midst of a
period in which much of the world has been embarking on the task of
democratization. In such a period, it would be especially odd to
concentrate our regulatory efforts on efficiency and efficacy alone. This is so
particularly in light of the fact that from the standpoint of democratic
theory, the contemporary American system of public law is nothing to
celebrate. Democratic deliberation on the central issues is discouragingly
rare. Sensationalistic anecdotes often dominate public debate. Powerful
interest groups-on the left, right, and center-exert excessive influence
over regulatory policy. Real participation in the public and private

spheres is at best episodic. In this light, few matters deserve higher
priority than institutional changes designed to increase the democratic
character of the modem state.</p>
      <p>I claim here that the three general reforms would promote not only
efficiency and efficacy, but democracy as well. Strategies of disclosure
and education are the precondition for a well-functioning democratic
process. Without information, people cannot carry out their roles as
citizens. Economic incentives have the fortunate consequence of requiring
participants in the democratic process to focus on the key question: How
much reduction in (say) risk do we want, and at what price? By contrast,
existing approaches tend to distract attention from that question, and to
direct it toward other issues that are at once less relevant and less
intelligible. Decentralization is, under current conditions, an indispensable
part of any strategy for democratization. The national government is
simply too remote for general citizen control.</p>
      <p>The reforms for economic efficiency therefore go hand-in-hand with
reforms for democratization. To be sure, we will at some stage have to
make some difficult choices between efficiency and democracy.' But for
the next generation, the three fundamental changes will bring about
powerful movements in both directions.</p>
      <p>In this essay I will be painting with an extremely broad brush.2 My
aim is to set out the very general contours of reform strategies. In order
to do this, the discussion of particular questions will have to be greatly
compressed. In the near future, of course, the particulars will deserve
much greater detail. I sacrifice attention to specifics with the
understanding that in thinking about reform of American public law, the
general defects of the system have been lost too often, in favor of discussion
of unnecessarily incremental changes.</p>
      <p>This essay has four parts. In Part I, I discuss the rise of the modem
regulatory state, with particular reference to the New Deal period. Here
I explore how the New Deal attempted simultaneously to increase
economic efficiency and to promote democratization-and how it failed, in
important respects, on both counts. In Part II, I explore the current
state of regulatory government. I attempt to show its multiple
inefficiencies and to say something about the consequences of those inefficiencies
for the economy. I also explain why the current system of public law
fails from the democratic point of view. In Part III, I outline remedies
for the current situation, arguing that across a broad range, the goals of

economic efficiency and democratization are entirely compatible. Part
IV offers some significant qualifications to this general claim.</p>
      <p>I.</p>
      <p>THE NEW DEAL</p>
      <p>President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, undertaken in the 1930s,
represented a fundamental restructuring of the American legal system.
Some people think that it amounted to a kind of constitutional
amendment.' We need not go so far in order to recognize its foundational
status in modem American government.</p>
      <p>The New Deal operated against a well-defined constitutional
backdrop.4 That backdrop included the three basic cornerstones of the
American legal system: checks and balances; federalism; and individual rights.
The New Dealers viewed all of these in the context of the Great
Depression, which left huge numbers of Americans out of work. In that
context, the New Dealers thought that the pre-existing system of individual
rights protected both too little and too much. That system consisted
largely of the common-law catalogue of rights "against" government,
including most notably private property and freedom of contract.</p>
      <p>For the New Dealers, this catalogue protected too much, since it
immunized existing holdings of property from democratic control. Not
everything that people had, under the common law, was genuinely
entitled to legal protection. The pre-existing system of rights also protected
too little, since it furnished no safeguards against the various hazards of
the market economy, including unemployment, homelessness, disability,
and disease.</p>
      <p>The emerging conception of rights called for redistribution of various
kinds and also for recognition of a novel category of protected interests.
The ultimate result was President Roosevelt's second Bill of Rights,
including "the right to a useful and remunerative job," "the right to earn
enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation," "the right
of every family to a decent home," "the right to adequate medical care
and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health," "the right to
adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness,
accident, and unemployment," and "the right to a good education." 5
Institutional changes followed from these ideas. Against the backdrop

PAPERS AND ADDRESSES OF FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT 41 (1969) (speech delivered Jan. 11,

of the new conception of rights, the original system of checks and
balances seemed anachronistic.6 Far from a precious safeguard of liberty
from government, that system appeared an unnecessary constraint on
democratic action designed to promote economic productivity and to
protect the disadvantaged. The most radical attacks on checks and
balances-including The Coming American Fascism,' a publication intended
not as a warning but rather as an optimistic statement of the wonderful
things to come-were rejected. But the attack on the system of checks
and balances did have two enduring legacies. It helped produce a
concentration of judicial and lawmaking power in the presidency, which was
no longer restricted to execution of the laws, narrowly understood.' It
also contributed to the New Deal enthusiasm for "independent"
agencies. These novel entities combined traditionally separated functions and
were immunized from direct control by any of the constitutionally
specified branches.</p>
      <p>Under the New Deal reformation, the system of federalism fared little
better. Those who produced the original framework envisioned states as
an obstacle to national action,9 and also as an arena for democratic
selfdetermination. For the New Dealers, the states were not a guarantor of
freedom, but on the contrary a barrier to necessary social change. A
redirection of authority from the states to the national government was
indispensable if public officials were to carry out their new tasks. Greatly
expanded national power, mostly under the commerce clause, was the
result.</p>
      <p>Once authority was thus redirected, there was no doubt that the
presidency would be the principal beneficiary. In a single bold stroke,
Roosevelt united the Hamiltonian belief in an energetic executive with
the Jeffersonian belief in collective self-determination. The presidency
became the focal point for democratic self-governance.</p>
      <p>In the New Deal period, the belief in economic productivity and the
belief in democracy were thoroughly merged. New institutions were
necessary above all to improve the operation of the economy-increasing
business confidence, providing the preconditions for stock markets,
ensuring people of the stability of banks, managing the business cycle, and
protecting farmers against undue economic fluctuations. Eventually
spurred by Keynesian economics, the New Deal understanding of the
role of the state was centered on the goal of economic prosperity.
Roosevelt's program is often associated with protection of the

taged, and this idea was indeed central to him.'° But government
assurance of the successful performance of the economy was the principal goal
of the New Deal reforms.</p>
      <p>This idea did not conflict with democratic ideals. On the contrary, the
market system that preceded the New Deal was subject to sustained
challenges in this period, precisely on democratic grounds. Before the rise of
modern regulatory institutions, common-law courts, which were hardly
accountable to the people, created much of the basic system of
governance. Thus the law of property, tort, and contract was a crucial
regulatory system. It had been created by the unelected judiciary.</p>
      <p>In the early part of the century, courts went so far as to interpret the
Constitution as embodying common-law principles." In this way they
immunized the common law from democratic control. By contrast, the
new entities created by the New Deal were intended to be popularly
accountable. Indeed, those entities would be supervised by the people in
ways that would lead to large gains in democratic self-governance. Thus
it was that the belief in economic prosperity and democratic government
marched hand-in-hand.</p>
      <p>Contemporary governmental structures are best understood as an
outgrowth of the New Deal reformation. Our current system is not, of
course, by any means identical with what emerged from the New Deal
period. There have been occasional bursts of governmental activity and
retrenchment, and these have been quite important. Above all, the
"rights revolution" of the late 1960s and early 1970s witnessed an
extraordinary growth of new regulatory entities, rivalling the New Deal
itself in scope and importance.' 2 Of particular interest was the creation
of institutions designed to reduce risks in consumer products, the
workplace, and the natural environment.</p>
      <p>Here the rhetoric of "rights" and "redistribution" accompanied the
claims of democracy and efficiency. The new entities were supposed to
protect the "right" to a safe workplace, an unpolluted atmosphere, and
in clean water-and also to shift resources from (among others)
employers to employees. Both economic and democratic goals were important
here as well. The new institutions were supposed to remove a substantial
drain on the economy, and also to reflect democratic judgments about
risk reduction.</p>
      <p>Much the same can be said about the new attack, prominent since the

1960s, on discrimination on the basis of race, sex, and disability.
Discrimination has been challenged as a barrier to economic productivity
and to the political equality so crucial to democratic principles. In the
area of civil rights, economic and democratic aspirations played a central
and complementary role.</p>
      <p>At least since the election of President Reagan in 1980, we have been
in a period of retrenchment, in which New Deal reforms have often been
rethought in favor of renewed attention to the capacities of private
markets. The enforcement practices of federal agencies have been
significantly changed as a result. But there has been no fundamental
rethinking of current institutions. The changes have been largely
incremental.</p>

      <title>THE STATUS Quo</title>
      <p>How has our system of public law actually performed? Has it
promoted economic prosperity and democratic governance? We now have
considerable evidence on both scores. And while there have been some
significant successes,"l much of the overall story is dismaying.</p>
      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>A. Inefficiency</title>
        <p>The current system of public law has been extraordinarily inefficient.
The annual net cost of regulation has been estimated at between $44 and
$200 billion. 4 There is no question that we need not spend this amount
for the benefits we actually receive.</p>
        <p>So-called economic regulation-calling for price and entry controls in
various sectors of the economy-produced unnecessary and exorbitant
costs for American consumers. Thus it is estimated that airline
deregulation yielded gains to airlines and travellers of about $15 billion
annually.'5 The corresponding numbers for trucking deregulation and
railroad deregulation were $30 billion and $15 billion. 6 The Natural
Gas Act, which allowed government control of gasoline prices, certainly
contributed to the dangerous gas shortages of the 1970s.' 7 The resulting
inefficiencies led to decreases in industrial production, losses of hundreds
1991]
of thousands of jobs, and reductions in the supply of gas for millions of
Americans.1 8</p>
        <p>Nor are inefficiencies limited to the area of economic regulation. The
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has delayed the entry of
beneficial foods and drugs into the market, significantly increasing risks to
safety and health.' 9 The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) fuel
economy standards appear to have produced uncertain gains in light of
the fact that manufacturers were in any case moving to smaller and more
efficient cars; but they did lead to significant losses in lives as a result of
producing more dangerous, lighter vehicles.2 ° The United States spent
no less than $632 billion for pollution control between 1972 and 1985.21
Some studies suggest that alternative strategies could have achieved the
same gains at less than one-quarter of the cost. 22</p>
        <p>So much for the facts. What is the cause of the current situation? A
pervasive source of regulatory inefficiency in the United States is the use
of rigid, highly bureaucratized "command and control" regulation,
which dictates, at the national level, control strategies for hundreds,
thousands, or millions of companies and individuals in an exceptionally
diverse nation. Command and control regulation is a dominant part of
American government in such areas as environmental protection and
occupational safety and health.</p>
        <p>In the environmental context, command and control approaches
usually take the form of regulatory requirements of the "best available
technology" (BAT), which are almost always imposed only on new pollution
sources. BAT strategies are pervasive in federal law. Indeed, they are a
defining characteristic of regulation of the air, the water, and conditions
in the workplace.23</p>
        <p>One of the many problems with BAT strategies is that they ignore the
enormous differences among plants and industries and among
geographical areas. In view of these differences, it is wildly inefficient to impose
nationally uniform technological requirements. It does not seem sensible
to impose the same technology on industries in diverse areas-regardless
of whether they are polluted or clean, populated or empty, or expensive
or cheap to clean up.</p>
        <p>There are other sources of inefficiency as well. BAT strategies require

(1988) (Clean Water Act).</p>
        <p>HeinOnline -- 25 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 955 1991
all new industries to adopt costly technology, and allow imposition of
more lenient standards on existing plants and industries. Through this
route BAT strategies actually penalize new products, thus discouraging
investment and perpetuating old, dirty technology. The result is
inefficiency in investment strategies, in innovation, and even in environmental
protection.</p>
        <p>Such strategies also fail to encourage the development of new pollution
control technology, and indeed, serve to discourage it by requiring its
adoption for no financial gain. Under the BAT approach, a company
that innovates will simply have to invest more in pollution control. It
will be punished rather than rewarded for the development of new
control technology. BAT strategies are also extremely expensive to enforce,
imposing on the EPA and the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) an extraordinary monitoring burden.</p>
        <p>Additional inefficiency stems from the fact that BAT approaches focus
on the technology at the end of the pipe. This is merely a way of aiming
at symptoms rather than underlying causes of pollution. For example,
sulfur dioxide emissions (the major source of acid rain) are controlled by
forcing coal-fired power plants to adopt costly "scrubbing" strategies. A
much cheaper method of control is to encourage companies to switch to
cleaner coal.24</p>
        <p>In general, governmental specification of the means of achieving
desired ends is a good way of producing inefficiency. Instead of permitting
industry and consumers to choose the "means"-and thus to impose a
form of market discipline on that question-we often select the means in
advance. The governmentally-prescribed means is often the inefficient
one.</p>
        <p>Other inefficiencies in existing law stem from inadequate attention to
the problem of incentives. Consider, for example, the Superfund statute,
which was created to deal with the problem of abandoned toxic waste
dumps. Congress' basic strategy was to impose joint and several liability
on everyone connected with the dump in question-managers or owners
of the site, generators of the waste, and transporters. 25 At first glance,
the strategy seems both fair and efficient: fair, because it imposes cleanup
duties on everyone; efficient, because it is likely to deter everyone from
contributing to the problem of abandoned waste sites.</p>
        <p>A predictable consequence of this strategy is to produce incentives, not
to clean up, but instead to have protracted litigation on the liability
question. If everyone is liable, it is almost as bad as if no one is. The liability
24. See B. ACKERMAN &amp; W. HASSLER, CLEAN COAL/DIRTY AIR (1981) (discussing
interest group pressures behind Clean Air Act).</p>
        <p>25. 42 U.S.C. §§ 9601-9675 (1988).</p>
        <p>HeinOnline -- 25 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 956 1991
of each person is effectively "decreased" by virtue of the sheer numbers
of people who are liable as well. For each person, contemplating possible
courses of action, liability must be understood in the context of a
situation in which many other people will be liable too. If hundreds of people
are subject to suit, one can be sure that there will be endless litigation on
the liability question. Thus it is that on average, seven years and at least
$4 million in transactions costs are necessary before final clean-up even
begins.26</p>
        <p>More generally, studies of the costs and benefits of regulatory
programs show a crazy-quilt pattern, including both too much and too little
regulation. Consider, for example, expenditures per life saved. 2 ' There
is now considerable data on the amount of money spent to save lives in
various government programs. Some programs pay for themselves in
terms of health and related savings. The lives saved are purely a bonus,
in the sense that they come for free. Other programs cost between
$100,000 and $300,000 per life saved-surely an amount well worth
spending. But still other programs cost $89 million per life saved, $92
million per life saved, even $132 million per life saved. To be sure, some
disparities, even significant ones, might well be expected in a
democracy.28 But it is difficult to believe that these differences reflect anything
but interest-group power and irrationality of various sorts. In any case,
they are highly inefficient.</p>
        <p>This brief summary should be sufficient to suggest that from the
standpoint of efficiency, much of modern government is ill-directed. Some
programs are not beneficial at all. Others have unnecessary and costly
side-effects. We could obtain the same benefits much more cheaply.</p>
        <p>Sometimes inefficiency in government, particularly when described by
economists, seems a dry and technical matter. But the consequences of
the status quo are anything but technical. They include a range of
adverse effects on human beings: excessively high prices, greater
unemployment, lower benefits in terms of safety and health, more poverty, and
increased difficulty for American companies and workers attempting to
compete in an increasingly international market.</p>

      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-2">
        <title>Democracy</title>
        <p>The New Deal aspired not only to greater efficiency but also to more
democracy. The New Dealers hoped for a system in which citizens and
representatives, operating through responsive but expert organs, would
make deliberate decisions about the basic system of public law. In place
of the undemocratic; ad hoc systems of common-law ordering and
judgemade constitutionalism, new regulatory institutions would be subject to
political will and carry out public instructions. The new regime was to
combine a high degree of accountability with a high degree of
deliberation.</p>
        <p>In practice, this democratic aspiration has often been defeated. People
rarely have enough information to participate at all, or at all well, in the
processes of government. The extraordinary concentration of regulation
in Washington has hampered democratic deliberation both in localities
and in the private sphere. The use of complex technological
mechanisms, and their centrality to actual outcomes, have contributed to the
power of well-organized interest groups over the regulatory process.
Thus it is that the New Deal has helped bring about a kind of
Madisonian nightmare of government by faction.2 9</p>
        <p>Democratic failures have often been documented.3 ° The BAT
approach, for example, is severely deficient from the standpoint of a
wellfunctioning political process. That approach ensures that citizens and
representatives will be focussing their attention not on what levels of
reduction are appropriate, but instead on the largely incidental and nearly
impenetrable question of what technologies are now available.3' Because
of its sheer complexity, this issue is not easily subject to democratic
resolution. Moreover, the issue is not the relevant one for democratic
politics, which is the appropriate degree and nature of environmental
protection-an issue to which the BAT question is only indirectly
related.</p>
        <p>The focus on the question of "means" also tends to increase the power
of well-organized private groups, by allowing them to press
environmental and regulatory law in the service of their own parochial ends. These
ends include, for example, the promotion of ethanol, which is helpful to
corn farmers though not necessarily to environmental protection; other
fuels might well be preferable on environmental grounds. Ends favored
by parochial interests also include governmentally-compelled use of coal
"scrubbers," which are helpful to eastern coal, although not necessarily
to air quality. The use of already-clean coal might well be better.32
In this respect, the BAT strategy is emblematic of a far more general

problem in current regulation. Centralization at the national level
diminishes opportunities for citizen participation. It promotes intense and
unproductive struggles among well-organized factions. Education of
citizens about the key issues-risk levels and risk comparisons-is at best
episodic. In their capacity as consumers, citizens, workers, or users of
the air and water, people are inadequately informed of the risks that they
face. Public attention tends to be focussed on particular incidents, which
are gripping and sensationalistic, but often misleading.</p>
        <p>In these circumstances, it is difficult to ensure that citizens and
representatives will be involved in deliberating about different strategies for
achieving social goals, or for deciding what those goals are in the first
place. By directing attention to means, the system also creates powerful
incentives for interest groups to ensure that they are favored in the
legislature or the bureaucracy. Thus it is that current institutions cannot
carry out Roosevelt's goal of linking the Hamiltonian commitment to an
energetic executive with the Jeffersonian belief in self-government. The
democratic aspirations of the New Deal have largely been defeated.</p>
        <p>REMEDIES</p>
        <p>It would be most fortunate if the inefficiencies in current regulation
could be remedied through reform strategies that simultaneously
promoted democratic government. In this section, I argue that the same
reforms that would increase efficiency would indeed promote democracy.
I deal with three such reforms: disclosure and education; economic
incentives; and decentralization.</p>
        <p>Many Americans are unaware of the risks that they face in day-to-day
life. Often workers do not know about toxic substances in workplaces, or
about the risks that they cause. Consumers of ordinary foods are unable
to evaluate the dangers posed by fats, calcium, sugar, and salt. People in
small communities do not know that toxic waste dumping has occurred;
and if they know the facts, they do not know the risks.</p>
        <p>Scenarios of this sort are especially likely in light of the fact that
ordinary people have a difficult time obtaining information about risk.
Causation is extremely complex here, and accurate inferences are extremely
difficult to draw. Often risks take many years to materialize. Individual
susceptibility varies. Changing technology makes learning from the past
a hazardous enterprise. 3</p>
        <p>It would be reasonable to say that in cases of this sort, the interest in
freedom or autonomy-quite apart from efficiency and
democracy-requires a governmental remedy. Knowing choices are a precondition for
liberty. Claims from efficiency and democracy argue in the same
direction.3 4 Disclosure by the government itself, or by others at the
government's behest, will often promote both efficiency and democracy.

        <title>Efficiency</title>
        <p>When information is lacking, there may well be a conventional case of
market failure under economic criteria.3 5 To be sure, information-like
other goods-is a scarce commodity. Perhaps the market has produced
the optimal level of information. The optimal level is not complete
information. If so, there is no market failure-even if there might be a
problem under noneconomic criteria. But there are several reasons why the
market for information may indeed fail.</p>
        <p>First, information is sometimes a public good. Once it is available at
all, or to anyone, it is available to everyone or to many people. People
can thus capture the benefits of information without having to pay for its
production. Once created, a report discussing the risks posed by
carcinogens in the workforce may well benefit employees a great deal-but no
individual employee has the right incentive to pay his proportional share
for the report. Each employee has the incentive to "free ride" on the
efforts of others. The result is that too little information will be
forthcoming.</p>
        <p>The point applies to materials about shared risks in general. Indeed,
the point applies to materials about all information of shared importance.
It suggests that there is a strong prima facie case, on economic grounds,
for governmental interference in the information market.</p>
        <p>Second, manufacturers may have poor incentives to provide
information about hazardous products. Competition over the extent of danger
may decrease total purchases of the product rather than help any
particular manufacturer obtain greater sales. The phenomenon has sometimes
played a role in discouraging competition over safety among
manufacturers of tobacco products. At least in principle, the phenomenon may
occur frequently.36</p>
        <p>Information asymmetries may produce a "lemons" problem, in which
34. A qualification is necessary here. By offering more information than is efficient, the
government may create inefficiency. By providing information, however, the government
promotes a certain conception of liberty.</p>
        <p>35. See P. ASCH, CONSUMER SAFETY REGULATION (1988); Rose-Ackerman, supra note
33, at 356.</p>
        <p>36. There are, however, many cases in which companies compete over safety, and in this
sense the market often works as an effective check on dangerous products.</p>
        <p>HeinOnline -- 25 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 960 1991
dangerous products drive safe ones out of the market.37 Imagine, for
example, that producers know which products are safe, but that
consumers cannot tell. Safe products may not be able to compete if they sell for
no higher price than dangerous ones, if safe products are more expensive
to produce, and if consumers are unable to tell the difference. In that
case, the fact that sellers have information, while buyers do not, will
ensure that "lemons"-here dangerous products-will dominate the
market. Regulation designed to provide information is the proper remedy.</p>
        <p>All this suggests that there is frequently a market failure in the
provision of information. At least as a presumptive matter, government
remedies are an appropriate response. These remedies might take the form of
governmentally-provided information, education campaigns, or
disclosure requirements. Strictly on economic grounds, there is much to be
said in favor of these remedies. They may fortify the operation of the
marketplace. They may be a precondition for free choice, the
background goal of free markets.</p>
        <p>We now have a good deal of empirical information about disclosure of
risks. In general, the information suggests that disclosure can be a
helpful and cost-effective strategy.38 Workers do indeed respond to new
information about risks, quitting or demanding higher salaries. Consumers
often react well to the disclosure about danger levels. In general, there is
every reason to think that governmentally-mandated disclosure, if
suitably designed, is an effective mechanism for promoting economic
efficiency.</p>
        <p>2.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-4">
        <title>Democracy</title>
        <p>Suppose that we wanted to increase the democratic character of
contemporary government, by promoting citizen participation in, and
control over, governmental processes. A good initial step would be for
government to provide enough information so that people can make
knowledgeable judgments.</p>
        <p>Government might itself supply information, or require disclosure by
private citizens and companies. Return, for example, to the matter of
expenditures per life saved.39 There is now considerable data on the
amount of money spent to save lives in various government programs.
As we have seen, what emerges is a crazy-quilt. Some programs pay for
themselves in terms of health and related savings; others are extremely
hard to defend. At the very least, the American public should be
informed of these disparities so that it can evaluate them. Provision of
information about the content and expense of regulatory programs
should be high on the governmental agenda.</p>
        <p>Or consider the question of risk regulation in general. On that
question, people are poorly informed.' For example, they appear not to
know that the risks of nuclear power are substantially smaller than the
risks posed by other energy sources. They appear not to have a clear
sense of the relationships among different risks that are confronted in
everyday life. Smoking, for example, produces 345,000 deaths per year,
an annual risk of 3.0 in 103; all occupations produce between 11,000 and
200,000 annual deaths, an annual risk of 1.1 to 20 in 10'; and boxing
produces only three deaths a year, an annual risk of 5.4 in 10".</p>
        <p>Information of this sort ought to be widely available. The fact that it
is not creates a significant failure in government regulation. At least
equally important, it presents a large obstacle to citizenship. The
problem appears in the private sector, in local government, and at the state
and national levels. Workers uninformed of risks are unable to
participate usefully in the process of deciding among different possible levels of
workplace safety. Local communities, deciding whether to allow toxic
waste sites or plants that produce sulfur dioxide, need to be in a position
to make informed choices.</p>
        <p>A large virtue of a federal system is that it permits different states,
having different values, to make different choices about social
arrangements. In the context at hand, many decisions about the relations among
industrial development, employment, pollution, and risk must be made at
the state or local level. An absence of information is a severe obstacle to
this process. The same is true at the national level, where sensational
anecdotes displace reasoned analysis of the alternatives.</p>
        <p>The most general way to put the point is to note that on the framers'
view, America was to be a deliberative democracy, in which
representatives, accountable to the people, would make decisions through a process
of deliberation uncontrolled by private factions.4 Without better
information, neither deliberation nor democracy is possible. Legal reforms
designed to remedy the situation are a precondition for democratic
politics.</p>
        <p>40. Some of this is undoubtedly a product of heuristics of various sorts. But more
information could help overcome some of the relevant biases.</p>

      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-5">
        <title>CurrentSteps</title>
        <p>The national government has started a series of steps in the right
direction. Mandatory messages about risks from cigarette smoking, first set
out in 1965 and modified in 1969 and 1984, are the most familiar
example.42 The FDA has long maintained a policy of requiring risk labels for
pharmaceutical products. 43 The EPA has done the same for pesticides
and asbestos." There are numerous other illustrations. Indeed, the
effort to provide information counts as one of the most striking, if
incipient, developments in modern regulatory law. Three recent initiatives are
especially notable.</p>
        <p>In 1983, the OSHA issued a Hazard Communication Standard
(HCS), 45 applicable to the manufacturing sector. In 1986, the HCS was
made generally applicable. Under the HCS, chemical producers and
importers must evaluate the hazards of the chemicals they produce or
import; develop technical hazard information for materials safety data
sheets, and labels for hazardous substances; and, most important,
transmit this information to users of the relevant substances. All employers
must adopt a hazard communication program-including individual
training-and inform workers of the relevant risks.</p>
        <p>In 1986, Congress enacted an ambitious new statute, the Emergency
Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRKA).4 6 Under this
statute, firms and individuals must report, to state and local government,
the quantities of potentially hazardous chemicals that have been stored
or released into the environment. Users of such chemicals must report to
their local fire departments about the location, types, and quantities of
stored chemicals. They must also give information about potential
adverse health effects. A detailed report suggests that EPCRKA has had
important beneficial effects, spurring innovative, cost-effective programs
from the EPA and from state and local government.4 7</p>
        <p>The FDA has also adopted informational strategies. In its most
ambitious set of proposals, the FDA seeks: (a) to compel nutritional labelling
on nearly all processed foods, including information relating to
cholesterol, saturated fat, calories from fat, and fiber; (b) to require compliance
with government specified serving sizes; (c) to compel companies to
conform to government definitions of standardized terms, including,
"reduced," "fresh," "free," and "low;" and (d) to allow health claims only if

they (1) are supported by scientific evidence and (2) communicate clear
and complete information about such matters as fat and heart disease, fat
and cancer, sodium and high blood pressure, and calcium and
osteoporosis.48</p>
        <p>These initiatives are simply a beginning. Broader and more ambitious
programs, coordinating the general communication of social risks, are
very much in order. It has been suggested that government might
eventually develop a "national warnings system" containing a systematized
terminology for warnings.4 9 Such a system could apply to all contexts
and risks, and give a uniform sense of risk levels. The existence of a
uniform language would make it possible to assess risks across a wide
range of social spheres.</p>
        <p>Most important of all, such a system would perform a vital educative
function, one that could complement the functioning of markets and
provide a necessary precondition for democratic choice. We should
ultimately aspire to go far beyond risk regulation, to promote the
dissemination of information bearing on democratic affairs in general.</p>
        <p>B.</p>
        <p>By economic incentives, I mean financial penalties imposed on
harmproducing behavior or benefits conferred on harm-reducing behavior.
Such penalties should supplement and even displace
command-and-control regulation.</p>
        <p>1.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-6">
        <title>Efficiency</title>
        <p>It is inefficient for government to prescribe the means for achieving
social objectives. Ordinarily it would be far better, on economic grounds,
for government to create incentives to engage in socially desirable
conduct, and to permit the market to decide how companies respond to
those incentives.</p>
        <p>It is especially inefficient for government to dictate technology. A far
better approach is to impose a tax on harmful behavior, 0 and to let
market forces determine the response to the increased cost. Government
should generally impose fees on those who put pollutants into the
atmosphere-instead of, for example, mandating costly "scrubbing"
technol48. See 56 Fed. Reg. 60,302 (1991) (to be codified at 9 C.F.R. pts. 317, 320 &amp; 381)
(proposed Nov. 27, 1991).</p>
        <p>49. See W. KiP Viscusi, W. MAGAT &amp; J. HUBER, supra note 38, at 155.</p>
        <p>50. A Coasian qualification is necessary here: Sometimes the apparent victim of the
harmful conduct is in the best position to avoid the harm, and in such cases it is possible to say that
the apparent victim should be charged with taking preventive or remedial measures. An
example would be a case in which workers could cheaply prevent the costs of a chemical in the
workplace, by wearing masks or clothing that prevent the harm from occurring.</p>
        <p>HeinOnline -- 25 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 964 1991
ogy for sulfur dioxide. Consumption of the harm-producing good will
decline. Producers will shift to less harmful methods of production.
They may, for example, substitute clean for dirty coal.</p>
        <p>More generally, government might adopt a simple, two-step reform
policy in the area of social risks and social harms."' First, those who
impose harm must pay for it-by purchasing permission to do so,
perhaps through a licensing procedure. Second, those who obtain the
resulting permission should be able to trade their "licenses" with other people.
In the pollution context, this would mean that people who reduce their
pollution below a specified level could trade their "pollution rights" for
cash.</p>
        <p>In one bold stroke, such a system would create market-based
disincentives to pollute and market-based incentives for pollution control. Such a
system would also reward rather than punish technological innovation in
pollution control, and do so with the aid of private markets. Very
generally, and quite outside the environmental area, it makes sense to think
about programs of this sort for regulation of harmful behavior. 2</p>
        <p>An idea of this kind might be made part and parcel of a system of
"green taxes." With such a system, we might levy taxes on people who
impose externalities on others-users of dirty automobiles, farmers who
employ pesticides, coal-fired power plants, gasoline that produces air
pollution, products that contribute to destruction of the ozone layer or the
greenhouse effect. Tax levies of various sorts are used by many nations
already, though they have been slow in coming to the United States. 53</p>
        <p>These levies have had, or are projected to have, excellent results. Thus
a higher tax on leaded gasoline in Great Britain increased the market
share of unleaded gas from four to thirty percent in less than a year.54 It
is estimated that a doubling of pesticide prices would cut pesticide use in
half." It is also estimated that a fee of $110 per ton on carbon would
decrease carbon dioxide emissions by twenty percent by the year 2005.56</p>
        <p>An important advantage of such strategies is that they would
dramatically increase government revenues. This is an especially worthwhile
goal in a period of large deficits. The suggested carbon tax would

        <p>52. The most controversial application would be civil rights, but even here the proposal
seems plausible. See Mashaw, Implementing Quotas, 79 GEo. L.J. 1769 (1991) (discussing
transferable quota requirements).</p>

ate over $130 billion.57 Other such taxes on polluting activity could
produce billions of additional dollars in revenue. 58</p>
        <p>Economic incentives could be applied in other areas as well. Workers'
compensation plans, for example, operate as a reasonably effective
guarantee of workplace safety. According to a recent study, "If the safety
incentives of workers' compensation were removed, fatality rates in the
United States economy would increase by almost 30 percent. Over 1200
more workers would die from job injuries every year in the absence of the
safety incentives provided by workers' compensation." 9 This contrasts
with a mere two to four percent reduction in injuries from OSHA, an
amount that links up well with the fact that annual workers'
compensation premiums are more than 1000 times as large as total annual OSHA
penalties.' The tax system could be used to punish employers who
provide dangerous workplaces.</p>
        <p>The Consumer Product Safety Commission could experiment with a
system in which producers of harm-producing products would pay a fee
into the federal treasury. Ultimately, we might hope for a coordinated
system of risk regulation, one that imposed uniform fees for
harm-producing activities.</p>
        <sec id="sec-3-6-1">
          <title>2. Democracy</title>
          <p>Thus far we have seen that a shift to economic incentives would be
efficient and effective. What consequences would such a shift have for
democratic government?</p>
          <p>The answer is that it would have significant consequences, and that
these would be extremely beneficial. 61 The current system puts public
attention in the wrong places. Imagine, for example, that Congress and
the citizenry-following the contemporary model-are asking the
question whether ethanol, or some other gasoline substitute, should be
required in new cars. It is perfectly predictable that in answering this
question, well-organized groups with a significant stake in the outcome
will bring their influence to bear. It is also predictable that ethanol
producers may seek and actually obtain regulatory benefits, and for reasons
bearing little or no relationship to environmental protection.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the underlying substantive question-whether
ethanol is actually an environmentally superior product-will have to be
resolved on the basis of technological complexities not easily addressed by

discussion here.
the public or its representatives. If this is the issue on which the political
process focusses, we are therefore likely to have a series of laws that
represent, not public-spirited deliberation with a measure of broad
accountability, but instead trade-offs among well-organized private groups, or, in
Madisonian terms, government by faction. By directing attention to
means, this system creates strong incentives for interest groups to ensure
that they are favored in the legislature or the bureaucracy.</p>
          <p>Compare a system of economic incentives. Here the issue is not one of
means, but the amount of sulfur dioxide that will be allowed into the
atmosphere-an issue to be resolved in the process of deciding how many
licenses should be given out, and for how much pollution. This shift
would ensure that citizens and representatives would be focussing on
how much pollution reduction there should be, and at what cost. The
right question would be put squarely before the electorate. No longer
would it be possible to pretend that environmental protection is costless.
No longer would the central issue be displaced by the largely incidental
question of means.</p>
          <p>Moreover, a system of financial penalties allows far less room for
interest-group maneuvering. The large question-how much environmental
protection at what cost--does not readily permit legislators to favor a
well-organized, narrow group, such as the agricultural lobby, or the coal
lobby. Special favors cannot easily be provided through a system of
economic incentives. The very generality of the question will work against
narrow favoritism. To be sure, the ultimate question of pollution
reduction may be answered in a way that reflects sustained political pressure
rather than democratic deliberation. But the risks are minimized,
certainly as compared with the existing system.</p>
          <p>There are other democratic advantages as well. Economic incentives
should simultaneously promote coordination and rationality in
regulation, by giving government an incentive to attend closely, and for the first
time, to how other risks are treated. This should bring a salutary
measure of structure and sense to risk regulation in general. As an important
by-product, the new system should create a powerful incentive to obtain
information about the actual effects of pollution and pollution control. If
members of Congress are deciding on the level of risk reduction, they will
not want to do so in a vacuum, especially in light of the significant costs
of large reductions. Affected groups will therefore be encouraged to
engage in research about real-world consequences.</p>
          <p>Information about consequences frequently remains in its most
preliminary stages. The new premium placed on information should be a
particularly important gain. There is every reason to design regulatory
strategies that put a premium on greater research, so that when we act,
we know what we are getting, and at what price.</p>
          <p>HeinOnline -- 25 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 967 1991</p>
          <p>All these considerations suggest that economic incentives-favored so
firmly on economic grounds-have as one of their principal justifications
a series of democracy-reinforcing, faction-limiting characteristics.</p>
          <p>The movement toward economic incentives is preliminary but real.
Thus far, it has occurred mostly in the environmental area. An
important series of administrative initiatives have brought about "emissions
trading," especially under the Clean Air Act.62 Under the EPA's policy,
a firm that reduces its emissions below legal requirements may obtain
"credits" that can be used against higher emissions elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Through the "offset" policy, which is formally codified in the Clean
Air Act, a company may locate in an area not in compliance with
national air quality standards, if and only if it can offset the new emissions
by reducing existing emissions, either from its own sources or from other
firms. Through the "banking" policy, firms are permitted to store
emission credits for their own future use. Companies may also engage in
"netting," by which a firm modifies a source, but avoids the most
stringent emissions limits that would otherwise be applied to the modification
by reducing emissions from another source within the same plant.
Through the use of "bubbles," existing sources may place an imaginary
bubble over their plants, allowing each emitting device within the plant
to discharge different emission levels so long as the total emission level is
in compliance with aggregate requirements. We now have a good deal of
evidence about the emissions trading program.</p>
          <p>For various reasons, the use of the program has been quite limited.6 3
A study in 1986 showed 42 federal bubbles; 90 state bubbles; 2,000
federal offsets; between 5,000 and 12,000 acts of netting; and 100 acts of
banking. 61 Despite this limited activity, there is considerable evidence
that this policy has been successful. Overall, the program has produced
savings of between $525 million and $12 billion.6 5 By any measure, this
is an enormous gain.</p>
          <p>On balance, the environmental consequences have been beneficial.
Offsets must, by definition, produce environmental gains. The preliminary
evidence shows favorable effects from bubbles as well.66 There may be</p>
          <p>DEMOCRA TIZING AMERICA
modest beneficial effects from banking and modest adverse effects from
netting.67 The overall environmental effect is therefore good, with cost
entirely to one side.</p>
          <p>The EPA has also permitted emissions trading for lead. Under this
policy, a refinery that produced gasoline with lower than required lead
levels could earn credits. These could be traded with other refineries or
banked for future use.68 Until the termination of the program in 1987,
when the phaseout of lead ended, emissions credits for lead were widely
traded. EPA concluded that there had been cost savings of about twenty
percent over alternative systems, marking total savings in the hundreds
of million of dollars. 69 There have been initial administrative efforts as
well with respect to water pollution and ozone depletion.7 °</p>
          <p>The most dramatic program of economic incentives can be found in
the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act. The Act now explicitly
creates an emissions trading system for the control of acid deposition. In
these amendments, Congress has made an explicit decision about
aggregate emissions level for a pollutant.7 ' Whether the particular decision is
correct may be disputed. But surely there are large democratic benefits
from ensuring that public attention is focussed on that issue.</p>
          <p>There are other beneficial features to the acid deposition provisions.
Congress has said that polluters may obtain allowances for emissions
avoided through energy conservation and the use of renewable energy
sources. In this way, avoidance of this kind is turned into dollars, in the
form of increased permission to pollute. 72 This provision creates an
incentive to shift to conservation and renewable sources, without providing
further environmental degradation.</p>
          <p>Moreover, polluters are explicitly permitted to trade their allowances;
this is a first in national legislative regulation.7 3 In this way, people who
are able to reduce their pollution below the specified level receive
economic benefits. Again incentives are created for environmentally
beneficial behavior. An especially intriguing provision allows spot and advance
sales of sulfur dioxide allowances, purchasable at $1,500 per ton.74

Through this route, polluters must-for the first time-pay a fee for their
pollution. Even more intriguing is a provision calling for auction sales of
specified numbers of sulfur dioxide allowances.7 5 Here the market is
permitted to set the price for polluting activity.</p>
          <p>For the most part, however, the Clean Air Act does not require
polluters to pay for their "licenses." Instead, government continues to
permit them to pollute for free. This is a large obstacle to a sensible system
of regulation. In the future, Congress should build on the acid deposition
model, requiring payments by polluters and others who inflict social
harm.</p>

        <title>Efficiency</title>
        <p>Under current law, national standards are set both for the
environment and for workplace safety and health. 76 But as we have seen, the
costs and benefits of regulatory activity are widely variable across both
time and space. Consider, for example, the issue of clean air. To require
the same level of ambient air quality in Los Angeles and Wyoming makes
little sense in light of the fact that the costs (and benefits) of achieving
that level vary so dramatically. Uniform controls seem implausible if
Wyoming has already attained a level of X, and if Los Angeles could not
do so without suffering profound economic dislocations-including, for
example, ceasing use of the automobile. Such controls would be
grotesquely inefficient.</p>
        <p>Return to the area of workplace safety. It has been proposed that the
current system of collective bargaining should be replaced by
nationallymandated minimum standards.77 In fact, the OSHA now imposes a wide
range of national requirements for both safety and health. But surely
American workers do not agree about the appropriate tradeoffs among
health, wages, medical benefits, and jobs. Some employees are willing to
subject themselves to greater risks in return for greater benefits.7" Others
seek low level risks, and are willing to take lower salaries in return. 79

        <p>79. It is common at this point to express concern with the decision to trade safety for a
lower salary. To some extent, the concern is misplaced, since safety is not an absolute, and
since tradeoffs among important social goods, including safety, are a part of any imaginable
human life. To some extent the concern may point to a good argument for redistribution of
resources, so that people are not faced with such hard choices. But a bar to the preferred (even
if hard) choice is not the same as redistribution.</p>

Just as consumers make safety-related tradeoffs in the purchase of
consumer goods, such as cars, so workers differ in the employment market.
        </p>
        <p>In these circumstances, nationally mandated standards are inefficient.
They are ill-matched to the extraordinary diversity of worker values and
preferences. It would be far better to allow a degree of workplace
differences, matching that diversity. Decentralization would accomplish this
goal.</p>

      <sec id="sec-3-9">
        <title>Democracy</title>
        <p>If our goal is increased democratization, it is indispensable to promote
more decentralization. In the area of workplace safety, for example,
democratic solutions cannot be achieved at the national level. The
market mechanism of "exit"-permitting dissatisfied workers to
leavemight well be accompanied by the political mechanism of "voice," by
which workers participate in workplace governance.80 In order for that
latter mechanism to operate, it is crucial that workplace conditions be
decided at the local level. Opportunities for greater decentralization are
thus part and parcel of the process of democratizing the employment
market.</p>
        <p>In the area of environmental protection, it is also possible to
strengthen state and local options, and precisely in the interest of
democratization. We might, for example, permit dramatic variations with
respect to air and water quality, accompanied by national "floors" designed
to take account of interstate effects. Federal laws should be written to
minimize preemption of different state solutions. Judge-made
preemption doctrines should be designed to require a clear congressional
statement before allowing such preemption.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the national government might encourage the provision of
information to states and localities to allow them to decide how to deal
with such problems as release of toxic wastes. Through all these routes,
the democratic process at the local level might be strengthened, thus
promoting what is, as a practical matter, the only way to promote more
citizen engagement with governmental affairs.</p>

        <p>Here too a number of initial steps have been taken in the right

contributed to a reinvigoration of state authority. 1 We have seen a dramatic

growth in regulatory activity at the state level. Recycling programs are
now common. Sometimes fees are required for disposal of solid
wastean application of the basic principle that "polluters pay." Six states now
maintain programs for the reduction of sources of solid waste. California
has been especially inventive, adopting programs for reduction of toxic
substances" and, perhaps most dramatically, for reducing air pollution
in the badly polluted Los Angeles area. The latter program will require
conversion of all cars to electric power or other "clean" fuels by 2007;
other provisions will encourage public transportation and limit the use of
automobiles.8</p>
        <p>North Carolina has adopted a "pollution prevention program"
designed to prevent pollution before it occurs, rather than to impose
technology at the end of the pipe. These are simply a few of the many
respects in which recent initiatives have begun to implement Justice
Brandeis' aspiration that the states might serve as "laboratories"
experimenting with different systems for attaining social goals. 4</p>
        <p>Nor has the national government been inactive in this area. 5 Under
EPCRKA, discussed above, information about the toxic chemical
emissions must be provided to the states. The resulting information has been
used as the foundation for a wide range of laws at the state level.86
Oregon now requires pollution reduction goals, as does Massachusetts.
States have used the inventory as a basis for enforcement activity. Other
national initiatives might similarly act as a spur for state and local
decisions.</p>
        <p>There are some important qualifications to the arguments I have made
thus far. Informational strategies, economic incentives, and
decentralization have genuine limitations. In some cases, these approaches are
inadequate. I outline some of the relevant considerations.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-11">
        <title>The Limits of Information</title>
        <p>There are two problems with informational strategies. First, the
provision of information is expensive. Second, the provision of information is
sometimes ineffectual or even counterproductive.</p>

86. See GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE, REPORT TO CONGRESS, TOXIC CHEMICALS
(1991).</p>
        <p>Consider, for example, the fact that the government estimates the cost
of the new FDA rules at no less $1.7 billion over twenty years. The
president of the National Food Processors Association claims that the
first year costs alone will exceed $2 billion.87 In either case, the cost is
high. OSHA's hazard communication policy is estimated to save 200
lives per year-a lot-but at an annual cost of $360 million."8 The
expenditure per life saved is therefore $1.8 million. This is far better than a
large number of regulations, and an amount well worth spending; but it
is more than many agencies spend for life-saving regulations. It is
therefore not the case that the OSHA rule stands out as a means of saving
lives especially cheaply.</p>
        <p>When informational strategies are costly, there are two possible
responses. The first is to do nothing. If the savings-in terms of health,
life, informed choice-are relatively low, costly strategies, even
informational ones, make little sense. There will therefore be circumstances in
which a government remedy for an absence of information is
unwarranted.</p>
        <p>The second possibility is to impose a regulatory strategy rather than to
require disclosure. By a regulatory strategy, I mean a mandatory
outcome, such as a flat ban on the materials in question, or governmental
specification of a particular outcome, as in a mandated maximum level of
carcinogens in the workplace. Sometimes the regulatory strategy will be
cheaper, because the price of disclosing information-changing
packaging and so forth-is so high. This is likely to be the right response when
most or all people would respond to the information in the same way. In
that case, it is unnecessary to provide information, and better simply to
dictate an outcome that, by hypothesis, is generally preferred. For an
especially dangerous substance, one that reasonable people would not
choose to encounter, a flat ban is appropriate.</p>
        <p>Even when informational strategies are not prohibitively expensive,
they may be ineffectual, and thus have low benefits. People have limited
ability to process information.8" They have a notoriously difficult time in
thinking about low-probability events. Sometimes they discount such
events to zero; sometimes they treat them as much more dangerous than
they actually are. If people are told, for example, that a certain
substance causes cancer, they may think that it is far more dangerous than it
is in fact. But some carcinogenic substances pose little risk.</p>
        <p>For example, California's Proposition 65, an initiative designed to
promote citizen awareness of risk levels, requires warnings for exposure to

(H. Arkes &amp; K. Hammond eds. 1986).
carcinogens. At first glance the requirement seems unexceptionable,
indeed an important advance. But it has in some cases been
counterproductive. Consumers appear to think that twelve of every 100 users of
a product with the required warning will die from cancer. This estimate
exceeds reality by a factor of 1000 or more.' With respect to
information, less may be more. If information is not provided in a clear and
usable form, it may actually make people less knowledgeable than they
were before. The Truth-in-Lending Act has suffered from this
problem.9</p>
        <p>The problem is aggravated by the fact that people tend to use heuristic
devices that produce systemic errors. A particular problem here is the
"availability heuristic," in accordance with which people tend to think
an event is probable if they can readily bring to mind memories of its
occurrence. Thus, for example, an airplane disaster will be thought
relatively probable, whereas a death from diabetes will not be. There is a
good deal of evidence that people overestimate risks from highly visible
or sensational causes, but underestimate risks from less dramatic ones.92</p>
        <p>There is evidence as well of another problem for informational
strategies: people often believe themselves to be immune from risks that they
acknowledge are significant and real with respect to others. 93 In one
study, for example, ninety-seven percent of those surveyed ranked
themselves as average or above average in their ability to avoid both bicycle
and power mower accidents.94 Disclosure of information may be an
unhelpful tool when people do not internalize the new data.</p>
        <p>There is also evidence that people feel frustrated and frightened by
probabilistic information, and greatly prefer a certain answer. The desire
to reduce cognitive dissonance may prevent people from recognizing that
risks are real even when information is provided.9" The same desire may
undermine efforts to provide risk information when the truth is that
people must inevitably operate under conditions of uncertainty. This desire
may also prevent people from recognizing that conditions are dangerous
even in the face of solid information to this effect.
1991]</p>
        <p>There is a pervasive risk of information overload, causing consumers
to treat a large amount of information as equivalent to no information at
all.96 Finally, initially held beliefs are not easy to modify, even when new
information, undermining those beliefs, has been presented. 97</p>
        <p>Yet another problem is that disclosure requirements may have
unanticipated adverse effects. For example, companies may respond to
disclosure requirements by refusing to provide information at all (if this is an
available option). The result will be the removal from the market of
information that is useful overall. If industry responds to a requirement of
evidentiary support for scientific claims with mere "puffing," consumers
may have less information than they did to begin with. If advertisers
must conduct extensive tests before they are permitted to make claims,
they will be given a strong incentive to avoid making claims at all.98</p>
        <p>Finally, information may be an inadequate strategy where greater
safety is a public good.99 Imagine, for example, that the replacement of
carcinogen X with safe product Y would benefit all workers
simultaneously. Imagine, too, that each worker is bargaining separately with the
employer. In that case, no individual employee would have a sufficient
incentive to decrease his demand for wages and other benefits to obtain
increased safety. Because the benefits of the new substance would be
provided to everyone, no individual employee would "pay" enough to obtain
them, preferring instead to take a free ride on the efforts of others. The
result will be too little safety on conventional economic criteria. Here a
regulatory response is appropriate.</p>
        <p>All this suggests that there are real limitations to informational
strategies. These limitations should, however, be taken merely as
qualifications of the broader point, or as providing helpful guidance to those
seeking to design effective information requirements. They do not bear
fundamentally on reform efforts.</p>
        <p>The first and most important point is that some of these very
limitations can be overcome through more and better information. An
awareness of the distorting effects of current heuristics can help overcome
those effects; general publicity about those effects might therefore supply
a corrective. In addition, well-tailored programs would minimize the
relevant risks by putting the information in its most understandable form.</p>

on transactions cost barriers to free mobility of labor. If labor were completely mobile, the
problem should disappear.
Instead of labelling a substance a "carcinogen," a uniform system of risk
regulation could give better awareness of risk levels. While informational
strategies are no panacea, they would accomplish considerable good, at
least if the possible obstacles are kept firmly in mind.</p>
        <p>B.</p>
        <p>There are several possible problems with the use of economic
incentives. The clearest cases arise when the appropriate response to a
harmproducing activity is a flat ban. With an especially dangerous pollutant,
an increased price is inadequate. The pollutant should be eliminated
from the market, at least if its social benefits do not outweigh the relevant
danger and less dangerous substitutes are available. But if a flat ban is
not desirable, there should be a strong presumption in favor of economic
incentives.</p>
        <p>Another problem is that economic incentives might be thought to
operate as a regressive tax, in the sense that they raise prices in general, and
the rise will come down especially hard on the poor. An increase in the
price of gasoline, or in the cost of high-polluting vehicles, will make
things more difficult for poor people in particular. Indeed, any effort to
require manufacturers and sellers to "internalize" the costs of their
production might seem objectionable insofar as it increases prices in a way
especially hard on the indigent.</p>
        <p>In general, I do not believe that this objection is persuasive.'0 0 Any
regulatory solution will increase prices; economic incentives are not
distinctive in this regard. And if the solution is otherwise sensible, it ought
not to be treated as a "regressive tax," any more than the pricing system
itself is a regressive tax. Moreover, a refusal to require enterprises to
bear the social costs of their activities is hardly an effective way of
benefiting the poor. The class of people burdened by this refusal includes
many people not poor at all; and the refusal burdens many poor people.</p>
        <p>It is certainly correct, however, to worry about the consequences of
price increases, produced by market forces or by government, for poor
people. The point suggests that the taxes or fines produced by economic
incentives might be accompanied by subsidies or transfer payments to
people who are needy. Some of these subsidies might be funded out of
the very revenues produced by the program itself.</p>
        <p>It is also possible to argue, as against economic incentives, that they
improperly "commodify" certain interests. Perhaps some such
interests-the right to bodily integrity, the right to freedom from
pollutionought not to be traded on markets at all. Perhaps such trading debases
and diminishes the interests in question, with harmful consequences for
100. See Sunstein, Administrative Substance, supra note 2.
social attitudes.'0 1</p>
        <p>In some settings the objection seems plausible. Thus there is reason to
question a decision to allow trading of body parts, or of gestational
capacities. But in the general context of regulatory law, it is doubtful that
the argument takes one very far. It seems implausible to suggest that
social attitudes would be materially changed by a system in which
polluters and others who cause harm must pay. Indeed, a shift of the
entitlement from the polluter to the pollutee might have desirable effects on
social attitudes, by establishing the correct starting point. 10 2 In any case,
it seems far better to require people who cause harm to pay, rather than
to allow them to do so for free.</p>
        <p>Any incentive-based system must confront a range of practical
problems. In the environmental context, for example, there is a risk that
polluters will cluster in a particular area, thus subjecting people in that
area to unacceptably high danger.'o 3 Determining the amount of any tax
or fine is not a simple scientific exercise. It entails a democratic judgment
about appropriate risk levels, and that decision will pose great difficulties.
But these sorts of questions should be treated as matters of detail. They
do not bear fundamentally on the shift to economic incentives.</p>
        <p>C.</p>
        <p>Decentralization is not a preferred approach in at least three categories
of cases. The first involves national moral commitments that cut across
local boundaries. The most obvious candidates here are the prohibition
on discrimination on the basis of race and sex. Here decentralized
solutions are inadequate. The whole point of the national commitment is to
ensure adherence to a principle that transcends state boundaries. The
Civil War, establishing a prohibition on slavery and a requirement of
racial equality, is the core example.</p>
        <p>The second category involves interstate spillovers, of which air
pollution is the most conspicuous example. Because air pollution in California
will affect Nevada, we cannot rely entirely on intrastate controls. There
are inadequate political safeguards in one state against the imposition of
harms on another. In such cases, national intervention is necessary.</p>
        <p>101. In the environmental context, see S. KELMAN, WHAT PRICE INCENTIVES? (1981); on
commodification in general, see Radin, Market-Inalienability, 100 HARV. L. REV. 1849
(1987).</p>

          <p>103. See S. BREYER, supra note 17.
Even here, however, such intervention should take the form of
"floors"minimum standards-rather than nationally dictated outcomes.</p>
          <p>The third category is the most interesting. In a federal system, states
compete with each other for revenue-attracting business and industry.
This competition creates an important "race to the bottom" with respect
to regulatory controls. In many respects this is entirely healthy. The
right of exit is a critical check against oppressive law. Indeed, the right
of exit is probably a more important constraint on oppressive legislation
than the Supreme Court's decisions under the dormant commerce clause,
even if all these are taken together.</p>
          <p>But the "race" can have unfortunate consequences as well. Suppose,
for example, that state A wishes to impose occupational safety and health
controls--or even disclosure requirements-on industries within its
borders. Suppose that such industries are free to leave. It may well be that
in such circumstances, no state will impose the relevant controls, even
though all states, if agreement were possible, would choose to do so.
President Roosevelt made precisely this argument in supporting child
labor legislation at the national level.</p>
          <p>In some cases, then, the race to the bottom will put states in a
prisoners' dilemma, requiring a cooperative solution in the form of a binding
agreement through the national government. Through legislation at the
national level, states can prevent the mutually destructive competition to
attract business and industry.</p>
          <p>This argument does not prove as much as might appear. Sometimes
national legislation will not be in the interests of the states' own people,
since it will drive down profits in a way that will have adverse effects on
(among other things) poverty, employment, and the general availability
of goods and services. But national legislation will sometimes be justified
on this ground.</p>

        <title>Democracy and Markets: Potentialfor Conflict</title>
        <p>In most of this essay, I have argued that economic and democratic
goals can march hand-in-hand. Across a wide range, we can attempt
precisely the same reforms to bring about both of these goals. For this
reason, there is no need to choose between efficiency and democracy, at
least for most of our efforts in the next generation.</p>
        <p>It would be a mistake, however, to pretend that there is no potential
for conflict. An exploration of that potential of course raises extremely
large and complex issues. I make only a few brief observations.</p>
        <p>The most important point is that efficiency is a function of aggregated
private willingness to pay, a criterion that is, to say the least, problematic
from the democratic point of view. A system is efficient if entitlements
have been allocated so as to "maximize value," with reference to private
willingness to pay. For believers in a democratic system, however, this
criterion is distorted, and in two ways. First, a democratic system
operates on the principle of one person, one vote. By contrast, a market
allocates "votes" in accordance with how much people are willing to pay for
things. Since willingness to pay is a function of ability to pay, rich people
will be willing to pay far more than poor people. Indeed, the indigent
can pay nothing at all. The principle of political equality, so central to
democratic theory, is violated by the efficiency criterion.</p>
        <p>Second, a democratic system, at least in America, is not supposed to
represent an effort to aggregate private preferences."° Instead the
process is a deliberative one, in which different information and perspectives
are brought to bear. In that deliberative process, preferences are
supposed to be transformed into values. °5 Markets do not have this
function.</p>
        <p>The notion of aggregating private willingness to pay accurately
captures the economic ideal of "consumer sovereignty." But whatever its
value in some contexts, this is a caricature of the American conception of
sovereignty. That conception aspires not to aggregated consumption
choices, but instead to a transfer of the power of governance from the
King to "We the People." Insofar as markets accurately capture private
willingness to pay, they are a powerful tool of prosperity, and on a
certain, not wholly implausible view, of liberty as well. But this salutary
function is not the same as democratic self-governance. The considered
judgments of the citizenry may well diverge from aggregated
consumption choices."°c And when there is such a divergence, the former should
generally prevail.</p>
        <p>These objections to the willingness to pay criterion, invoking
democratic principles, are hardly irrelevant to the reform of American public
law. They suggest that exclusive use of the principle of cost-benefit
analysis is highly objectionable. They suggest that there will indeed be
conflicts between democratic aspirations and the goal of economic efficiency.
But if what I have said is persuasive, a great deal can be done before
reaching those conflicts.</p>

        <p>CONCLUSION</p>
        <p>Throughout its history, American government has benefited from its
democratic features and from structural characteristics that promote
effectiveness and efficiency. The benefits are especially conspicuous when
viewed in comparison to other governmental systems. But in its current
incarnation, it suffers from significant failures. The modern regulatory
state is often ineffective. It has not been efficient. It is hardly a model of
democratic self-governance. In a period in which nations all over the
world are seeking to promote both efficiency and democracy, it would be
unfortunate indeed if we did not subject our own institutions to skeptical
scrutiny.</p>
        <p>In this essay, I have suggested three reforms in contemporary public
law. Information-based strategies, increasing disclosure and education,
should supplement or even displace regulatory systems. Economic
incentives, including taxes and fines, should substantially displace
command-and-control regulation. Decentralization, allowing bargaining and
participation in the private and public spheres, should in many contexts
be substituted for centralized dictates from Washington. All of these
proposals would respond simultaneously to inefficiencies in modern
government and to severe problems from the democratic point of
viewmost notably factional influence and absence of opportunities for the
exercise of political influence.</p>
        <p>I do not contend that reforms of this sort would accomplish all that is
now required, from the standpoint of either efficiency or democracy.
There are genuine limits to all three strategies. At some point, moreover,
it will be necessary to reconcile some serious conflicts between efficiency
and democracy. But we now have both the information and the tools by
which to accomplish an enormous amount of reform. We need not rest
content with the paradoxes and failures of existing institutions.</p>
