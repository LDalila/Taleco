        <title>The use of oathsin legal proceed</title>
        <p>ingsinwhichevidenceis givenis an
ancientpartof the commonlaw. Sir
EdwardCoke notedthatthe "word
oath is derivedfromthe Saxon word
eoth."The oath is nothingless,said
Coke, than"an affirmatioonr
deniall byanyChristianof anythin
glawfulland honest,beforeone or more,
thathave the authorityto givethe

rightc,allingAlmightyGod to
witness thathis testimon yis true"
(1809, 165).1Yet thereis evidence
thattheuse of oathsextendsback to
Roman times,wherethe law of the
TwelveTables
providesthat"Whoevergivesfalseevidencemustbe
thrownfromtheTarpeian rock"
(Stephens1883,1: 11). And Cicero
inDe Officiiasrguesthat"in taking
an oath it is our dutyto consider
notwhatwe mayhave to fearin
case
ofviolationbutwhereinitsobligationlies: an oath is an assurance
backed byreligioussanctitya;nd a
solemnpromisegiven,as before
God as one's witness,is to be
sacredlykept"(1991, III: 104,383). As
Samuel Pufendorfemphasized,oaths
werenot simplythepreserveof
Christians:</p>

"The courtsofjustice,in

moraland legal inheritanceof the

        <p>None of themajorwriterswith

"infamous,and grosslyscandalous,

and itwas underthisrubricthathe
included"perjuryand subornation

arguingthat"perjury... is of all

even afterit originatedin the Star
Chamber,itwas onlyby"slow
degrees[that]theconclusionthatall
perjuryin a judicialproceedingis a
crimewas arrivedat" (Stephens
1883,3: 241, 247). In 1562-63there

Demosthenes:"Those who escape

of thegods; but thoseon whomyou
can layhands,neverconsignoverto

does not do so; suppose furtherthat

Even then,thenewHouse of

        <p>To see why,considerthatthe

theSenate trialcannotgo forward.
No managers,no trial;butonlythe

Thus,the House and Senate may

not allow presidentsto be removed
forwantof "good behavior"-forthe
obviousreasonthathe does not

Moreover,thereshouldbe no doubt
thatthe Framerswere seriousin
restrictintghemselvesto highcrimes

the
impeachmentclause,othertextual referencesto crimedo not

Thus,theExtraditionClause applies
to anyonewho commits"Treason,

        <p>Whichleads me to thethirdand

role of thespecial prosecutorin this

temptationto imaginethatwhatwe

This is a mistaketoday,even though
