 On Truisms and Constitutional Obligations: A Response In our essay on the confirmation process of Supreme Court Justices,' we sought to support four propositions: 1. The current confirmation process is working poorly.2 2. In a development that is without precedent in our history, presidents of a single party made eleven consecutive appointments to the Supreme Court, even though the Senate, except for a brief period of time, was controlled by another party.3 This development threatened to create a Court that lacks the appropriate range of views on constitutional issues.4 3. The Constitution contemplates an independent role for the Senate in deciding whether to consent to presidential nominations Such a role would be especially desirable under the conditions described in (2), even if it leads to the rejection of nominees because of their likely voting patterns. the Senate to assume such a role, given our recent experience, both to decrease the level of distraction and antagonism in the recent nomination proceedings7 and to produce greater quality and diversity on the Court. 7. Our essay referred particularly to the emphasis placed on the nominee's telegenic qualities, to distortions of Judge Robert Bork's record, to the effects of television on some Senators' behavior, and to the uninformative generalities offered by some recent nominees. See id. at 1518-19, 1518 n.107, 1519 n.110. Response: Truisms and Constitutional Obligations great deal of evidence to support this claim, and he criticizes us for not discussing some of this evidence. Texas Law Review carry out his duty to make the Constitution a workable scheme. Whether this is characterized as a duty of "comity," or instead as a "constitutional obligation," does not really matter. It would be the President's responsibility-notwithstanding the undoubted fact that the Constitution does not say that the President may play a role in congressional consideration of a bill, and even though the President certainly has no formal role before a bill is presented for his signature. Professor McGinnis has also not persuaded us that the language of the Appointments Clause argues against our view. That language is unavoidably awkward, at least to the modem ear: "[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint... Judges of the supreme Court.... "19 Professor McGinnis's explanation is that "[t]he Senate's consent is advisory because confirmation does not bind the President to commission ... the confirmed nominee."' This is a plausible explanation of the wording of the text, but it has the serious drawback of making the key word-"Advice"-redundant: the "advisory" character of the Senate's consent is fully secured by the separation of nomination and appointment. 17. We are grateful to Professor McGinnis for correcting some errors in identifying the first names of certain delegates. Id. at 639 n.29. We do not believe, however, that these errors are relevant to the correctness of the propositions discussed in our essay. Response: Truisms and Constitutional Obligations about whether a nomination was effective (even if it was consented to by the Senate) if the President did not obtain the proper form of "advice" before making it. Further, our position does have the virtue of not making the term "Advice" superfluous. Finally, Professor McGinnis suggests that we are mistaken in saying that a nominee bears the burden of proof because, in his view, the Appointments Clause makes it difficult for the Senate to reject a judicial nominee without "compelling reasons."21 is so, according to Professor McGinnis, because a "political burden" is placed on the Senate whenever it publicly rejects a presidential choice.' We agree with both of these points. But again they are, we think, essentially irrelevant to the Senate's assessment of its constitutional responsibilities. In general, it seems quite sensible to say that a nominee should be rejected only for "special and strong reasons."' But under the extremely unusual circumstances of the recent past,' we believe that such reasons exist if the nominee is unable to show that he would add quality and an appropriate degree of intellectual diversity to the Supreme Court. No one has a right to serve on the Court. In the face of eleven consecutive appointments by Republican Presidents, a Senate controlled by the Democrats would be perfectly entitled to insist on its constitutional prerogatives-and this is so even if the Senate may face political barriers to this course of action, and even if the President insists on continuing to choose people of whom the Senate disapproves. with his view of its lawful construction."' Accordingly, a President who accepted our arguments "and agreed with the Senate in advance to nominate a jurist whose constitutional views differed substantially from his own would abrogate this most solemn oath."' This is a striking claim. It would mean, to give just one example, that unless President Hoover "substantially" agreed with the principles of early Legal Realism, he violated his oath of office when he nominated Benjamin Cardozo to the Supreme Court. In our view, Professor McGinnis's argument rests on a simple misunderstanding, a form of category mistake. Professor McGinnis's reliance on the President's oath of office? is a makeweight argument: invoking the oath just raises the question of what the Constitution requires. In order to determine the President's duty under the Constitution-in this case, under the Appointments Clause-one must interpret that Clause, using all appropriate textual, historical, and structural arguments.
