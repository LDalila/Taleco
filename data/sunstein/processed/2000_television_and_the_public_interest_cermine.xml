FUTURE: FINAL REPORT OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC INTEREST OBLIGATIONS OF

through the opportunity to see, through work on the Advisory Committee, two groups close up. The
first was a large number of broadcasters-most of them public-spirited, most of them extremely
nervous about growing competition from cable and elsewhere, most of them sharply opposed to
government mandates, few of them unwilling to accept governmental help. The second was the
National Association of Broadcasters (NAB)-at the time an extraordinarily defensive, fearful,
uncooperative, aggressive, and self-protective organization, consisting of many honorable people, but
often unwilling to compromise or even to reflect. In this way, the NAB was reminiscent of the tobacco
industry in, say, the 1960s, and was enthusiastic about using the First Amendment in the same way that
the National Rifle Association uses the Second Amendment, that is, as an all-purpose shield against
any action adverse to their interests. The author is grateful to other members of the Advisory
Committee for many helpful discussions of these problems and, in particular, to the two co-chairs of

Television and the Public Interest</p>
      <p>Cass R. Sunstein</p>
      <p>The communications revolution has thrown into question the value of
imposing public interest obligationson television broadcasters.But the
distinctive nature of this unusual market-with "winner-take-all"features,
with viewers as a commodity, with pervasive externalitiesfrom private
choices, and with market effects on preferences as well as the other way
around-justifiesa continuing rolefor government regulationin the public
interest.At the same time, regulationbest takes the form, not of
anachronistic command-and-control regulation, but of (1) disclosure
requirements, (2) economic incentives ("pay orplay"), and (3) voluntary
selfregulation through a privately administered code. Some discussion is
devoted to free speech and antitrustissues, and to the different possible
shapes of liability andproperty rules in this context,
treatingcertainprogramming as apublic "good" akin to pollution as apublic bad.</p>
      <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
      <p>There is a large difference between the public interest and what
interests the public. This is so especially in light of the character and
consequences of the communications market. One of the central goals of the
system of broadcasting, private as well as public, should be to promote the
American aspiration to deliberative democracy.' a system in which citizens
are informed about public issues and able to make judgments on the basis
of reasons. Both norms and law should be enlisted in this endeavor; if one
fails, the other becomes all the more important. These are the claims that I
attempt to bring to bear on the so-called communications revolution.</p>
      <p>This revolution has been driven by extraordinary technological
change.2 The rise of cable television, the Internet, satellite television,
direcTV, and digital television has confounded ordinary understandings of
"television.' 3 Before long, digital television may enable viewers to choose</p>
      <p>1. See, e.g., Amy GUTMANN &amp; DENNIS THOMPSON, DEMOCRACY AND DISAGREEMENT 52-94
(1996) (discussing ideals of deliberative democracy); Joshua Cohen, Democracy and Liberty, in
DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY 185, 185-231 (Jon Elster ed., 1998) (discussing foundations of deliberative
democracy).</p>
      <p>2. A valuable general discussion can be found in ANDREW L. SHAPIRO, THE CONTROL
REVOLUTION (1999).</p>
      <p>3. See BRUCE M. OWEN, THE INTERNET CHALLENGE TO TELEVISION 311-26 (1999) (dealing
with other dramatic technological developments).
among over a thousand programs.4 The possible combination of television
and the Internet, a combination now in its early stages, may prove an
equally dramatic development; the fact that the Internet is a partial
substitute for television has already introduced a measure of competition
between the two.5</p>
      <p>Law has responded to these developments in fits and starts, largely by
attempting to engraft legal requirements designed for the old environment
onto an altogether new communications market. The result is a high degree
of anachronism, misfit, and drift, and in the view of many observers, a
series of constitutional violations.6 Most of the modem debate involves a
vigorous but increasingly tired contest between those defending the old
regulatory order7 and those urging rapid movement toward "simple rules"
for government control of television, above all well-defined property rights
and freedom of contract! Strikingly similar debates, about the value of
"simple rules," the place of regulatory safeguards, and the role of
television in a democracy, can be found in many nations. 9</p>
      <p>My aim in this Article is to discuss an important part of the
intersection between the emerging communications market and law: public
interest obligations imposed on television broadcasters." Since the initial rise of
broadcasting in the United States, government has treated the license as a
kind of "grant" that is legitimately accompanied by duties." Congress and
the FCC have required broadcasters to follow a range of requirements-a
form of old-style "command-and-control" regulation, growing out of an
enforcement of property rights).</p>
      <p>9. See MONROE E. PRICE, TELEVISION: THE PUBLIC SPHERE AND NATIONAL IDENTITY (1995);
Goldberg et al., supranote 5.</p>
      <p>10. I use this term to refer to literal broadcasters, and thus not to include cable providers. As we
will see, however, the distinction between the two seems increasingly (though not yet entirely)
artificial, and much of the discussion will bear on the appropriate regulatory stance toward television in
general.</p>
      <p>11. See discussion infra Part LA.
understanding that there would be three, and only, three, private
broadcasting stations. Much, though far from all, of this regulation was eliminated in
the 1980s. 12 A large question is the extent to which public interest
requirements continue to make sense, or even to survive constitutional scrutiny, in
an entirely different communications market where broadcasters occupy a
decreasingly distinctive position.</p>
      <p>The question was posed starkly with the enactment of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996,3 one of whose central concerns
involved the rise of digital television. The Act had to deal with two issues.</p>
      <p>First, who would have the right to broadcast digital television? Should the
licenses be sold, or auctioned, or given outright to existing broadcasters?
Second, what public interest obligations, if any, should attach to the
ownership of a right to broadcast digital television? The Act squarely answered
the first question, 4 but was inconclusive on the second. In an extremely
controversial step, Congress did not sell or auction the right to broadcast
digital television, but basically gave the right to existing broadcasters for
free.' This has been described, and reasonably so, as a "huge giveaway" of
"a $70 billion national asset."'" At the same time, Congress refused to
eliminate public interest obligations, delegating to the FCC the power to
decide whether such obligations should be imposed on digital television
broadcasters, and if so, in what form." The FCC has not yet made that
decision or even commenced formal proceedings.</p>
      <p>In this Article, I offer two basic claims, one involving ends, the other
involving means. The first is that in view of the character and
consequences of television programming, any system for the regulation of
television should be evaluated in democratic as well as economic terms. The
economic ideal of "consumer sovereignty" is ill-suited to the
communications market. It follows that, at least in the near term, the changes
introduced by the emerging communications system do not justify abandoning
the idea that broadcasters should be required to promote public interest
goals. Educational programming and programming that deals with civic
questions can promote the aspiration to deliberative democracy; reliance
on an unregulated market may not. There are also legitimate grounds for
encouraging broadcasters to make programming accessible to people with
disabilities, above all the hearing impaired. I emphasize in this connection
some special characteristics of the broadcasting market, characteristics that
make it hazardous to rely on "consumer sovereignty" as the exclusive basis
for regulatory policy. Instead communications policy should be assessed,
at least in part, by reference to its effects on the public sphere."</p>
      <p>My second claim is that in order to promote the relevant goals,
government should decreasingly rely on command-and-control regulation, 9
and should consider instead three less intrusive and more flexible
instruments, each of which is well-adapted to a period of rapid technological
change. The instruments are: (1) mandatory public disclosure of
information about public interest broadcasting, unaccompanied by content
regulation; (2) economic incentives, above all subsidies and "play or pay";
and (3) voluntary self-regulation, as through a "code" of appropriate
conduct, to be created and operated by the industry itself. These instruments
have played an increasing role in regulatory policy in general, especially in
the environmental arena?° But they have rarely been discussed in the area
of communications, where they have a natural place;2' and despite its
growing importance, the general topic of industry self-regulation has
received little academic attention.22</p>
      <p>By requiring broadcasters to disclose information about their public
interest activities, the government might be able to enlist public pressure
and social norms so as to create a kind of competition to do more and
better. This is the simplest and least intrusive of regulatory instruments. By
allowing broadcasters to buy their way out of certain public interest
obligations, the government should be able to ensure that those with an</p>

TRANSFORMATION OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE (Thomas Burger trans., 1989) (offering an extended
historical discussion).</p>
      <p>
        19. A question not addressed here is the content of any minimal requirements; I emphasize the
more flexible alternatives as the instruments of choice, without denying the need for some minima as a
"backstop." In the current system, for example, it may well make sense to require a degree of children's
programming and also free air time for candidates. See ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC INTEREST
OBLIGATIONS OF DIGITAL TELEVISION BROADCASTERS, CHARTING THE DIGITAL BROADCASTING

        ) [hereinafter FINAL REPORT]. The precise extent of
mandatory programming is beyond the scope ofthe present discussion, though I do refer to mandates at
several points below.

incentive to produce good programming are actually doing so, while also
producing the lowest-cost means of promoting public interest
programming. And by encouraging (not mandating) voluntary self-regulation, the
government can help overcome a kind of prisoner's dilemma faced by
participants in a "winner-take-all" market,I a prisoner's dilemma that
contributes to a range of social problems, often stemming from a kind of
"race to the bottom" with respect to programming quality.</p>
      <p>It should be clear that this basic approach combines a recognition of
the serious limits of unrestrained communications markets in promoting
social goals with a plea for rejecting traditional regulation and for enlisting
more flexible, market-oriented instruments in the service of those goals.</p>
      <p>This approach is consistent with some incipient but quite general trends in
regulatory law. 4 If the approach is sound, it is well-suited to the emerging
communications market; but it is easily adapted to other areas as well,
including environmental degradation, occupational safety and health, and
other social problems. It is much too soon to say whether there is a "third
way" between traditional command-and-control regulation and reliance on
free trade and well-defined property rights.'s But if there is indeed a "third
way," it is likely to be found in proposals of this kind.</p>
      <p>A general theme of this Article is that disclosure, economic
incentives, and voluntary self-regulation might displace government
commandand-control in a variety of areas of regulatory law. Specific themes include
requiring producers simply to disclose goods and bads; relaxing antitrust
law so as to permit cooperation designed to reduce some of the problems
associated with "races to the bottom"; and building on emerging
developments in environmental protection so as to allow far more imaginative
"trades" among producers. In short, it is time to move beyond the view that
market ordering and content regulation are the only two possibilities for
communications law. There are many alternatives, and real progress can
come only from exploring the choices among them.</p>
      <p>The Article comes in seven parts. Part I sets the stage, outlining the
history of regulation, identifying some relevant puzzles, and exploring
some diverse problems with television in its current form. Part II, the
theoretical heart of the Article, evaluates and rejects the claim that in the
emerging media market there is no longer room for public interest
regulation of any kind. I suggest that television is no ordinary commodity, partly</p>

(1995). The most important distinguishing feature of "winner-take-alr' markets is that rewards are

because of the collective benefits of good programming, partly because of
the link between television and democracy, and partly because viewers are
more like products offered to advertisers than consumers paying for
entertainment on their own. Part I discusses the relation between
principle and practice; it traces likely stages of the emerging market, with
broadcast programming becoming increasingly like general-interest magazines.</p>
      <p>Part IV deals with disclosure, exploring the possibility that relevant private
groups, invoking widespread social norms, can interact to produce
improvements in the broadcasting market without compulsory
programming of any kind. Part V deals with economic incentives, beginning with
the idea of "play or pay," and then adapting some ideas from the law of
tort to the law of broadcasting. Part VI examines whether a code of
broadcasting might operate as a kind of positional arms control agreement,
helping to counteract a situation in which broadcasters compete to the
detriment of collective goals. Part VII is a brief summary of regulatory
options.</p>

    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>A BriefHistoricalOverview26</title>
      <p>Broadcast licenses have never been treated like ordinary property
rights, open for sale on the free market.27 Since the initial enactment of the
Communications Act of 1934, the government has awarded licenses
to broadcasters in accordance with "convenience, public interest, [and]
necessity."' The Federal Radio Commission early described the system
as one in which broadcasters "must be operated as if owned by the
public.... It is as if a community should own a station and turn it over to
the best man in sight with this injunction: 'Manage this station in our
interest .... ",29 Under this "public trustee" standard, the FCC has imposed
a range of obligations on broadcasters-an idea that perhaps made special
sense when a small number of companies dominated the television market.</p>
      <p>In its initial set of guidelines, the FCC required stations to meet
the "tastes, needs, and desires of all substantial groups among the
listening public... ." This required "a well-rounded program, in which
entertainment, consisting of music of both classical and lighter grades,
religion, education and instruction, important public events, discussions of
public questions, weather, market reports, and news, and matters of interest
to all members of the family, find a place."31</p>
      <p>Often this kind of guidance operated as a general plea, with little
systematic enforcement. In 1960, however, the FCC went so far as to outline
fourteen of the "major elements usually necessary to meet the public
interest."3 2 These included: religious programming, programs for children,
political broadcasts, news programs, sports programs, weather and market
services, and development and use of local talent.33 The FCC eventually
specified its general guidelines, which were merely indicia of the types and
areas of appropriate service. The specifications included minimum
amounts for news, public affairs, and other nonentertainment
programming, including the controversial "fairness doctrine"' and also access rules
for prime-time. 5</p>
      <p>Substantial changes occurred in the 1980s, a period of significant
deregulation. The head of the FCC, Mark Fowler, declared (in a kind of
soundbite, or bumper-sticker, for the market approach to the topic) that
television is "'just another appliance,' a "'toaster with pictures."'3 6 The
fairness doctrine was largely eliminated, and many of the more particular
public interest requirements were removed?' Nonetheless, a number of
such requirements remain. For example, the FCC continues to say that if a
broadcaster sells airtime to one candidate, it must sell similar time to
opposing candidates as well. Congress itself has codified a right of this
kind?8 A long-standing statutory provision, in the obvious self-interest of
law makers, requires that if a broadcaster offers to sell time, it must do so
at the "lowest unit rate of the station" during the forty-five days before a
primary election and during the sixty days before a general or special
election. 9</p>
      <p>In recent years Congress has devoted special attention to children's
programming and to television access for the hearing impaired. In 1990,
Congress enacted the Children's Television Act of 1990,' limiting the
advertising on children's programming (twelve minutes per hour during
weekdays and ten and a half minutes per hour on weekends).41 Under this
statute, the FCC has further required broadcasters to provide three hours of
children's programming per week.42 The Television Decoder Circuitry Act
of 1990"3 requires new television sets to have special decoder chips,
allowing them to display closed-captioned television transmissions for the
hearing impaired. The Telecommunications Act of 1 9 9 6 44 requires use of
"v-chip" technology, designed to facilitate parental control over what
enters the home; it also contains ancillary requirements intended to ensure
"ratings" of programming content.45</p>
      <sec id="sec-2-1">
        <title>B. Two Puzzles</title>
        <p>Turn now to the present, or at least to the more recent past. From 1997
to 1998, a presidential advisory committee met to discuss the public
interest obligation of television broadcasters.46 Several of the broadcasters on
the Committee were quite skeptical about governmental mandates, but
highly receptive to the idea of adopting some kind of broadcasting "code,"
akin to the kind approved and administered by the National Association of
Broadcasters (NAB) between 1928 and 1979. 41 The Committee eventually
moved toward endorsing the notion of a code, and the idea received
considerable attention in the trade press.4</p>
        <p>In its annual meeting, however, the NAB signaled skepticism about
the idea and came very close to saying "no" and "never." A large part of
the broadcasters' objection was that any "code" would violate the antitrust
laws. This was very odd because in their discussions, members of the NAB
treated the possibility of an antitrust violation as extremely good news.
Take this as the first puzzle; it is not often that high-level corporate
officials are smiling when they discuss the possibility that their own action
would be found unlawful.</p>
        <p>Consider a second puzzle. During the committee's deliberations, some
people argued on behalf of a "play or pay" system, in which broadcasters
would be relieved of public interest obligations (to "play") if they agree
instead to "pay" someone else-another broadcaster-to do so. But many
of the broadcasters on the committee were quite skeptical of this approach,
arguing that public interest obligations were part of the (sacred?) duty of
every broadcaster, and that no one should be exempted for a price. This
was also very odd. It is not often that high-level corporate officials prefer
rigid government mandates to more flexible approaches. What explains
these puzzles? The answers-offered in closing here4 9-- reveal a great deal
about the emerging market.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-2">
        <title>C. Identifying the Problem</title>
        <p>To evaluate particular proposals, it is necessary to have a concrete
sense of why some people think that even well-functioning television
markets are inadequate. Consider the following possibilities, each of which has
produced public concern in the last decade:50
1. There may be insufficient educational programming for children.</p>
        <p>The existing fare may be insufficient because there is too little
simply in terms of amount (for example, for people who lack
cable), or because children do not watch the stations on which it
is available, or because the quality is too low.
2. Programming may not be sufficiently accessible to people who
are hearing impaired; this may be a particular problem if citizens
are unable to find out about emergencies, or if they are unable to
understand programming that bears on central public issues."
The exclusion may have practical consequences; it may even
produce a form of humiliation. 2
3. At least on the major networks, programming may be too
homogenous, in a form of "blind-leading-the-blind"
programming. Since a significant percentage of Americans do not receive

cable television and depend on broadcasters, the result may be
insufficient variety in programming."</p>
        <p>Some programming may be affirmatively bad for children if, for
example, it contains excessive violence, or otherwise encourages
behavior that is dangerous to self and others. The result of such
programming may be to produce violent or otherwise dangerous
behavior in the real world."
There may be too much violent programming in general, with
adverse consequences for adults, not only children! 5 The adverse
consequences may include an increase in violence (because of
changes in social norms or "copycat" effects56), general
demoralization and fear, or a misperception of reality.</p>
        <p>News coverage may be a form of "infotainment," dealing not
with real issues, but with gossip about celebrities and
unsubstantiated charges of various kinds. 7
There may be too little coverage of serious questions, especially
during political campaigns. The relevant coverage may involve

        <p>A glance at the situation shows that the physical and external means of collecting information
in regard to what is happening in the world have far outrun the intellectual phase of inquiry
and organization of its results. Telegraph, telephone, and now the radio, cheap and quick
mails ... have attained a remarkable development. But when we ask what sort of material is
recorded and how it is organized, when we ask about the intellectual form in which the
material is presented, the tale to be told is very different. "News" signifies something which
has just happened, and which is new just because it deviates from the old and
regular... [W]e have here an explanation of the triviality and "sensational" quality of so
much of what passes as news. The catastrophic, namely, crime, accidents, family rows,
personal clashes and conflicts, are the most obvious forms of breaches of continuity ... they
are the new par excellence ....
for people to deliberate well about important questions and
evaluate purely national practices. 9
9. It may be too expensive for candidates to reach the electorate via
television. The result may be excessive competition to
accumulate funds simply in order to have access to television; this
competition may have corrosive effects on the electoral process. Free
air time would be a possible response, perhaps qualified by an
obligation, on the part of the candidate, to speak for at least fifty
percent of the time or to refrain from negative campaigning.
10. There may be too little substantive diversity of view-too little
debate among people with genuinely different perspectives about
issues of policy and fact. Here too, the result may be an
insufficiently informed citizenry.'
11. The problem may be not homogeneity but heterogeneity, which
may result in a highly balkanized viewing public, in which many
or most people lack shared viewing experiences, or in which
people view programming that largely reinforces their own
convictions and prejudices I The result can be extremism and
fragmentation.62</p>
        <p>To be sure, some of these problems cannot be corrected through
regulation that is either feasible or constitutional. Moreover, these various
conceptions of the relevant problem point toward diverse solutions, some
of which would raise serious First Amendment problems, as discussed
below.63 A particular challenge is to develop approaches that would allow a
high degree of flexibility, minimize government involvement in
programming content, and also do some good.</p>
        <p>II</p>
        <p>PREFERENCES AND AUDIENCES</p>
        <p>It has increasingly been urged that any objections to existing
television are elitist or outmoded. On one view, public interest obligations have
no place in modem law, particularly because the "scarcity" rationale for
regulation grows weaker every day;65 it has even been urged that the FCC
no longer has any appropriate role.' Once the problem of scarcity has been
eliminated, individual consumers can design their own preferred
communications package, at least if the government permits them to do so.
Consider this utopian picture of a system of unrestricted markets in
communications:</p>
        <p>There will be room enough for every sight and sound, every
thought and expression that any human mind will ever wish to
convey. It will be a place where young minds can wander in
adventurous, irresponsible, ungenteel ways. It will contain not
innocence but a sort of native gaiety, a buoyant, carefree feeling,
filled with confidence in the future and an unquenchable sense of
freedom and opportunity.</p>
        <p>
          A conceptual point first: though many people claim to argue for
"deregulation," that route is not in fact an option, or at least not a
reasonable one. What "deregulation" really means is a shift from the status quo to
a system of different but emphatically legal regulation, more specifically
one of property, tort, and contract rights, in which government does not
impose specific public interest obligations but instead sets up initial
endtlements and then permits trades among owners and producers. This is a
regulatory system as much as any other. If it seems close to the current
system for newspapers and magazines, it is no less a regulatory system for
that reason; a great deal of law (inevitably) governs the rights and duties
of newspapers and magazines. Such law imposes rights and duties,
65. As noted below, the rationale has not disappeared; well over one-third of American
households continue to depend on free, over-the-air broadcasting. See U.S. BUREAU OF THE CENSUS,
STATISTICAL ABSTRACT OF THE UNITED STATES: 1998 at 573 (118th ed. 1998)

          . On some of the difficulties with the whole notion of
scarcity, see R.H. Coase, The FederalCommunications Commission, 2J.L. &amp; ECON. 1 (1959). The
defect of Coase's analysis is his (remarkable) lack of self-consciousness about the idea that consumer
sovereignty is the appropriate ideal for broadcasting; it is as if that idea is so self-evidently correct that
it need not even be defended.

        <p>68. I do not deal here with the question why broadcasters and newspapers should be subject to
different legal regimes. As a matter of fact, the difference seems to be a historical accident, associated
with the particular form of regulation chosen for broadcasting. See id. at 4-9. As a matter of principle,
the difference has been justified as a way of ensuring two competing regulatory regimes, each
welldesigned to combat the vices associated with the other. See generally BOLLINGER, supranote 7. In my
view, this justification is serious but not convincing, and some measures designed to promote a
wellfunctioning democratic culture might well be justified as applied to newspapers too. See CASS R.
SUNSTEIN, DEMOCRACY AND THE PROBLEM OF FREE SPEECH 107-08 (1993). For example, it would not
be unconstitutional, in my view, for government to require large metropolitan newspapers to have a
"letters to the editor" page, or to require such newspapers to disclose their public service activities, or
to require such newspapers to publish, on a nondiscriminatory basis, paid political advertising. For the
permissions and prohibitions; among other things, it ensures, via the law of
property, that some people, and not others, will have access to the public
sphere. The issue is thus not whether to "deregulate," but whether one or
another regulatory system is better than imaginable alternatives.</p>
        <p>Notice that this is a purely conceptual claim; it is not a normative
argument of any kind. Any market system necessarily depends on
regulatory controls, in the form of an assignment (by law) of property rights and
(legal) rules of contract. 9 A system of television is hard to imagine without
ownership rights; in the absence of ownership rights, who could use whose
spectrum for what purpose? It is no answer to point to voluntary
arrangements. Such arrangements are likely to break down without rules of law
allowing some people to exclude others. If the Columbia Broadcasting
System does not have a legal right to own spectrum and to enter into
binding agreements with others, it will not be able to provide television as we
know it. This point should be a familiar one for land and other "tangible"
property; it is no less true for the services provided by television. Indeed, it
holds, though to a lesser extent, for those who have web sites and provide
services over the Internet; without legal protection against trespasses, and
without a right to enter into legally enforceable agreements, web sites
would be a modern version of the state of nature-a battleground rather
than a framework for productive relationships. 0</p>
        <p>I therefore turn to the general question whether there remains any
reason for government to regulate television in the "public interest." My
concern here is both theoretical and empirical. The question is whether, in the
current market, broadcasters are likely to provide viewers what they would
like to see, and if so, whether that point is decisive on the question whether
public interest obligations should be imposed.71 The brief answer is that the
idea that broadcasters show "what viewers want" is a quite inadequate
response to the argument for public interest obligations.72 The discussion
most part, however, such requirements do not seem necessary. But I cannot discuss these issues in
detail here.</p>
        <p>69. In certain circumstances, norms may successfully do the work of law. See ROBERT C.
ELLICKSON, ORDER WIrHotrr LAw 4-6 (1991). But even in such circumstances, legal rules of property
and contract generally loom in the background.</p>
        <p>70. See Neil W. Netanel, Cyberspace Self-Governance: A Skeptical View from Liberal
DemocraticTheory, 88 CALm. L. Rlv. 395 (2000). Of course it is possible to imagine the Internet as a
form of genuine anarchy, unregulated by legal rules, with norms and self-help (in the form of code)
doing the work ordinarily done by the law of contract and property. Interestingly, the Internet is not
subject to the usual legal realist claim that private ordering is dependent on law and that law is
inevitable. See CAss R. Su1.sTEIN, THE PARTIAL CONSTITUTION 51-54 (1993). But it is very hard to
imagine this state of affairs for television, and those most critical of the existing legal structure seek
only to replace one legal regime with another. See HUBER, supranote 27, at 5-30.</p>

here deals with the technological present and the short-term future; later I
introduce complications from emerging technological developments.</p>
        <p>According to the economic model, a well-functioning television
market would promote the ideal of consumer sovereignty. On this view, the
point of markets is to satisfy consumer preferences. In this system, people
would satisfy their "preferences," as these are measured via the criterion of
private willingness to pay. People would be able to choose from a range of
options, and suppliers would cater to their tastes. To a considerable extent,
of course, the existing system already approaches this ideal, and this is
increasingly the case. But there are three serious problems, each suggesting
that the economic ideal of consumer sovereignty is not in fact served by
free markets in programming. These are market failures if it is assumed
that the purpose of a well-functioning television market is to ensure that
programming is well-matched to viewer preferences. In the next Part, I
question the market ideal itself.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-3">
        <title>1. Eyeballs as the Commodity</title>
        <p>The first point is the simplest. Currently television is not an ordinary
product, for broadcasters do not sell programming to viewers in return for
cash. A system of "pay-per-view" would indeed fit the usual commodity
model; but "pay-per-view" continues to be a relatively rare practice. The
difference between the existing broadcasting market and "pay-per-view" is
quite important. The key problem here is that viewers do not pay a price,
market or otherwise, for television. As C. Edwin Baker has shown, it is
more accurate to say that viewers are a commodity, or a product, that
broadcasters deliver to the people who actually pay them: advertisers.73</p>
        <p>This phenomenon introduces some serious distortions, at least if we
understand an ideal broadcasting market as one in which viewers receive
what they want. From the standpoint of consumer sovereignty, the role of
advertisers creates market failures. Of course broadcasters seek, other
things being equal, to deliver more rather than fewer viewers because
advertisers seek, other things being equal, more rather than fewer viewers.
But advertisers have issues and agendas of their own, and the interests of
advertisers can push broadcasters in, or away from, directions that viewers,
or substantial numbers of them, would like.</p>
        <p>This is a substantial difference from the ordinary marketplace.
Advertisers like certain demographic groups and dislike others, even when the
numbers are equal; they pay extra amounts in order to attract groups that
are likely to purchase the relevant products, and this affects programming
73. See C. EDWIN BAKER, ADVERTISING AND A DEMOCRATIC PRESs 25-87 (1994).
content.74 Advertisers do not want programming that draws product safety
into question, particularly if it concerns their own products and sometimes
even more generally.75 In addition, advertisers want programming that will
put viewers in a receptive purchasing mood, and hence not be too
"depressing."76 Advertisers also tend to dislike programming that is highly
controversial or that is too serious, and hence avoid sponsoring shows that
take stands on public issues.' In these ways, the fact that broadcasters are
delivering viewers to advertisers-this is largely their charge, under
existing arrangements--can produce offerings that diverge considerably
from what would emerge if viewers were paying directly for programming.
To this extent the notion of consumer sovereignty is seriously
compromised whenever programming decisions are a product of advertiser wishes.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-4">
        <title>2. InformationalCascadesand BroadcasterHomogeneity</title>
        <p>A second problem is that it is not clear whether broadcasters are now
engaged, in anything like a systematic or scientific way, in catering to
public tastes. At first glance it would seem obvious that broadcasters must
be engaged in this endeavor (subject to the qualification just stated,
involving the role of advertisers); if broadcasters are maximizing anything,
they must be maximizing viewers (subject to the same qualification). In
general, attracting viewers is their job7 But there is reason to question this
judgment, at least in its simplest form. Sometimes rational people make
decisions not on the basis of a full inspection of the alternatives, but on the
basis of an understanding of what other people are doing.79 Because people
obtain information from other people's actions, individual actions carry
with them one or more "informational externalities," which potentially
affect the decisions of others. Thus, rational and boundedly rational people,
in business as elsewhere, rely on the signals provided by the words and
deeds of others.'0 This reliance can produce cascade effects, as B follows A,
and C follows B and A, and D, as a rational agent, follows the collected
wisdom embodied in the actions of A, B, and C. Informational cascades
often produce unfortunate outcomes, in fact outcomes far worse than those
that would result if individuals accumulated information on their own.
Sometimes, moreover, people use the "availability" heuristic, deeming an
event more probable if an instance of its occurrence can be readily brought

to mind.8 Using the availability heuristic, broadcasters might reason that if
one show or another has attracted substantial viewers in the past, they
should copy it. The result would be "fads" and "fashions" in
program82
ruing.</p>
        <p>In theory, then, broadcasters might be building on the programming
judgments of other broadcasters, often, perhaps, reacting to the
"availability" of salient recent instances in which a particular program was
especially popular (dealing, let us suppose, with the Clinton-Lewinsky
scandal or the O.J. Simpson trial) or especially unpopular (dealing, let us
suppose, with South Africa). If this is true, private decisions by
broadcasters may produce both mistakes and homogeneity-mistakes, in the form of
programming that is not what viewers want, and homogeneity, in the form
of the "blind leading the blind."83</p>
        <p>Recent evidence suggests that this theoretical account has
considerable truth. A careful study shows that there is a good deal of simple
imitation, as networks provide a certain kind of programming simply by
imitating whatever other networks are doing Recently popular shows
tend to create cascade effects. This imitative behavior is not in the interest
of viewers. On the contrary, it creates a kind of homogeneity and
uniformity in the broadcasting market, and thus makes for problems in terms of
providing what viewers "want."' This is not a conventional market failure,
but it suggests that existing decisions are unlikely to promote consumer
sovereignty. The problem is rapidly diminishing with an increase in
available programming options, but to the extent that substantial numbers of
people continue to depend on a small number of broadcasters, the existence
of informational cascades suggests that the market does not entirely
promote consumer sovereignty.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-5">
        <title>3. Externalitiesand Collective Action Problems</title>
        <p>Even if broadcasters did provide each viewer with what he or she
wanted, a significant problem would remain, and from the economic point
of view, this is probably the most serious of all. Information is a public
good, and once one person knows something (about, for example, product
hazards, asthma, official misconduct, poverty, welfare reform, or abuse of
power), the benefits of that knowledge will probably accrue to others. 6
Note in this regard Amartya Sen's remarkable observation that no famine
has ever occurred in a democratic country with a free press. 87 This
observation is complemented by a series of less dramatic ones, showing the
substantial benefits for individual citizens of a media that is willing and able to
devote attention to public concerns, including the plight of the
disadvantaged.88 Individual choices by individual viewers are highly likely to
produce too little public interest programming in light of the fact that the
benefits of viewing such programming are not fully "internalized" by
individual viewers. Thus, individually rational decisions may inflict costs on
others at the same time that they fail to confer benefits on others. In this
respect, the problem "is not that people choose unwisely as individuals, but
that the collective consequences of their choices often turn out to be very
different from what they desire or anticipate." 9</p>
        <p>Most generally, there are multiple external effects in the broadcasting
area; some of these are positive, but unlikely to be generated sufficiently
by individual choices, while others are negative, and likely to be
excessively produced by individual choices. Consider a decision to watch
violent programming. In short, the effects of broadcasting depend on social
interactions. Many of the resulting problems are connected with
democratic ideals. A culture in which each person sees a high degree of serious
programming may well lead to better political judgments; greater
knowledge on the part of one person often leads to more knowledge on the part
of others with whom she interacts.9' Perhaps most important, a degree of
serious attention to public issues can lead to improved governance through
deterring abuses and encouraging governmental response to glaring
problems. In these various ways, public interest programming can produce
social benefits that will not be adequately captured by the individual
choices of individual citizens; the same is true for programming that
produces social costs, including apathy, fear, and increased criminal activity.'
Because of the collective action problem, an unregulated market will
underproduce public goods and overproduce public bads.</p>

government is prohibited from favoring programming of a particular
content, "play or pay" should be unacceptable. The problem with this view is
that it seems to convert the First Amendment into a species of Herbert
Spencer's Social Statics,"8' in a way that loosens the connection between
the free speech principle and underlying democratic goals. If the First
Amendment is associated with democratic self-government and with
deliberative democracy, "play or pay," of the sort suggested here, would be
perfectly consistent with the free speech guarantee. 9

        <title>Expandingthe Viewscreen: A Glance at the Cathedral</title>
        <p>Thus far I have been exploring economic incentives by contrasting
taxes and tradeable rights with command-and-control regulation. But if we
wanted a more complete picture, we would widen the viewscreen a bit. In a
classic article, Guido Calabresi and A. Douglas Melamed proposed four
"rules" that courts might adopt for nuisance suits."9 Two of the rules come
from a situation in which either the plaintiff or the defendant is given the
relevant entitlement, and it is protected via a "property rule," in which case
the entitlement could be reallocated only through a trade.191 The other two
rules come from a situation in which either is given an entitlement
protected by a "liability rule," in which case the entitlement could be
reallocated through a legally forced exchange, at a price determined through the
legal system (assumed to be the market price)."9 Calabresi and Melamed
also discuss "inalienability rules," in which no exchanges are permitted,
either voluntarily or through the legal system. 193</p>
        <p>There is a great deal of room for exploring, through this lens, the
system of public interest regulation. If public interest programming is
desirable, and if certain programming is undesirable, it makes sense to think of
ways of requiring broadcasters to pay "damages" or instead requiring the
taxpaying public to pay for better programming. Valuation, of course, is a
serious problem. Suppose that certain programming (educational or civic,
for example) is a public good, producing positive externalities, and that
certain programming (violent material, for example) is a public bad,
producing negative externalities. How can the government assign monetary
values to the desirable and undesirable effects? Is it constitutional for the
government to do so? These questions are hard enough in the area of torts;

        <title>Rule 1. The government requires all broadcastersto provide public inter</title>
        <p>est programming;no bargainingis allowed.</p>
        <p>Comment: This is the traditional model, with the debate being about
its scope; the number of obligations was sharply reduced in the 1980s, but
without rethinking the basic model. Under this system, the public's interest
in the relevant programming"9 is protected by an inalienable property rule.
The entitlement is granted to the government, and it is entitled to mandate
broadcaster performance. Broadcasters have a kind of "split" property
right; they own the right to broadcast as they choose (in general), but the
public has a kind of lien on the property, giving it ownership rights over
certain areas. Those who like the traditional approach appear to think that
it has good social consequences, by, for example, ensuring that public
interest programming is not relegated to unpopular times and channels, and
also that it has desirable "expressive" effects, by, for example, affirming
the status of broadcasters as public trustees. As we have seen, it also has
several problems; its rigidity is likely to lead to inefficiency, and it may
well produce unintended adverse consequences, as in the case of the
fairness doctrine.</p>

by the government and then used to fiund public interestprogrammingby
others,such as PBS.</p>
        <p>Comment: Under this approach, the public continues to have the
relevant entitlement, which is protected by an unusual liability rule. The
broadcasters' failure to provide educational programming for children or
free air time for candidates would count as a kind of social harm for which
broadcasters would have to pay. (The same might be said of the provision
of violent or sexually explicit programming, though here the First
Amendment problems would be quite serious.) One problem with this
approach is the need to calculate the level of the "damage award." There
are no clear market measures for this amount, which will therefore have a
level of arbitrariness.</p>

        <p>level of public interestprogramming,butpermits broadcastersto transfer
their obligations (accompanied by money) to others, at a

        <p>194. I am so describing it for convenience, without making any normative judgment.</p>
        <p>Comment: This is akin to Rule 2a, in the sense that the public has the
relevant entitlement, which is protected by a kind of liability rule, but here
the market, rather than the legal system, determines the value of not
playing the public interest programming. One station might sell to another its
obligation to provide, say, one hour of educational programming; the
selling station would pay the market-determined amount to ensure that the
buying station will find it worthwhile to take on the new duty. This kind of
market determination could be a substantial advantage in light of limited
information on the government's part, as the government is in an extremely
poor position to calculate any such "damage award."</p>
        <p>As compared with Rule 1, a potential problem with this approach is
that some people may avoid the stations that "play" and may not see the
relevant programming at all. On the other hand, the empirical question
remains whether under Rule 1 most members of the viewing audience will
see and benefit from the mandated programming.</p>

        <title>Rule 2c. The government establishes a minimum total content of public</title>
        <p>interest broadcastingon broadcastnetworks each year (for example, 6
hours offree air time for candidates,150 hours of
educationalprogramming for children); assigns initialobligations to each broadcaster;and
then permits broadcastersto trade the obligationsat market-determined
prices.</p>
        <p>Comment: This is very close to Rule 2b; the only difference is that it
is a precise analogy to certain initiatives in environmental law, in which
the government establishes a maximum level of pollution in the relevant
area, provides pollution permits, and then allows trades among polluters. 15
A disadvantage of this approach, as compared to Rule 2a, is that it may be
harder to calculate the total level of appropriate programming than to
decide on the appropriate tax for those who do not "play." On the other
hand, the opposite may be true.'96 An additional difficulty, as discussed
above, is that broadcasting hours are not fungible. An hour of children's
programming is much less valuable at 3:00 A.M. on Monday than at 9:00
A.M. on Saturday.</p>

        <title>Rule 3a. The government pays broadcasters(at reasonablebut government-determinedrates) to providepublic interestprogramming.</title>
        <p>Comment: Under this approach, the broadcasters have the relevant
entitlement, which is protected by a liability rule. The broadcaster owns the
entitlement, but the government is permitted to obtain a forced exchange,
just as it is in the general law of eminent domain. In fact it is possible to
see some kind of payment as the constitutionally compelled solution, at
least if the right to provide such programming as broadcasters choose is
taken to be, by constitutional decree, an entitlement in broadcasters. For
example, the government might be able to compel coverage of important
issues, or attention to the needs of children, or programming involving
emergencies, but the public has to pay.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the government appears not to have tried this approach,
at least not as a general rule. An advantage of this approach is that it should
not be difficult to calculate the value of the exchange; the market will help
answer that question. This is an important advantage over Rule 2a. On the
other hand, Rule 3a has probably been resisted, as compared with Rules 1,
2a, and 2b, with the thought that because broadcasters are beneficiaries of
public largesse, they should not be paid to promote public interest goals.
This is of course a distributional concern, and the underlying
judgmentthat "broadcasters," rather than "taxpayers," should pay-is not clearly
correct in light of the complexity of the incidence of the burden imposed
under Rules 1, 2a, or 2b. The burden under the latter rules does not simply
fall on "broadcasters," but more likely on advertisers and ultimately on
consumers-perhaps to the benefit of those who advertise in newspapers
and on cable. Rule 3a might be preferable if it is amended as suggested in
Rule 5a, which would require broadcasters to buy spectrum rights.</p>
        <p>An important difference between Rule 3a and Rules 2a, 2b, and 2c is
that the latter rules give the entitlement to the public, in a way that may
have important psychological effects on any trades. The initial allocation
of the entitlement creates an endowment effect and tends to "stick,"'" in
part because of its legitimating function. Those who favor public interest
obligations might be skeptical of Rule 3a for this reason alone.</p>
        <p>An additional problem with this kind of system is that it may provide
broadcasters with an incentive to produce less public interest broadcasting
on their own than they otherwise would, or at least to understate the
amount that they would voluntarily provide. In an unrestricted market,
political and shareholder pressures, conscience, and advertiser and viewer
demand will result in a nontrivial amount of public interest
programming. 9 ' But if the government proposes to pay broadcasters for whatever
public interest programming they provide, voluntary service may be
substantially reduced. This is a pervasive problem with paying people to do
good or not to do bad; the payment may induce less of the good or more of

        <p>Comment: This is a variation on 3a in the sense that it transforms the
broadcasters' entitlement into one protected by a property rule. It is akin to
a system of free markets in broadcasting, but with two
qualifications: Broadcasters are not required to pay for their entitlement in the first
instance, and government stands ready to compete with others who seek to
obtain access to viewers. One advantage of Rule 3b over 3a is that it
operates entirely on the basis of market-determined prices; no one has to
calculate a special government rate. But if one believes that existing fare is
not problematic, the government's purchases will be wasteful. And those
committed to public interest programming may object that the government
will not purchase enough (unless this is specified in some way in advance);
they may also object that so long as licenses are being given away free,
other rules, not giving a "windfall" to broadcasters, are better.</p>

        <p>Comment: Under this approach, the broadcasters' interest is protected
by a property rule. Broadcasters own the relevant entitlement. Just as
occurs in an ordinary market, people can pay broadcasters to provide
public interest programming, at market-determined prices. The problem with
this approach is that the market price might be too high, for all of the
reasons discussed in Part I.B of this Article. This approach is similar to Rule
3b, except that the government does not stand ready to ensure a certain
level of public interest programming.</p>

        <p>Comment: This is a genuine market solution. It does not involve
a governmental "giveaway" of a scarce resource, and after the valuable
commodity has been purchased, free trades are allowed. It seems to have
all the advantages of Rule 4, with the further advantage that the valuable
property right is purchased rather than simply conferred. The problems
with this approach should be easy to identify from Part I.B of this Article.
In short, the result may be insufficient public interest programming, partly
because of the endowment effect, partly because of collective action
problems, partly because of the limitations of the market model in the
communications industry, and partly because of public aspirations
diverging from private consumption choices.</p>

prices.</p>
        <p>Comment: This is quite similar to Rule 5a. The difference is that the
government stands ready to pay for public interest programming on
broadcast stations, at market prices; and if broadcasters for some reason refuse,
the government can force an exchange. Under Rule 5b, part of the
entitlement is owned, but protected only by a liability rule. This approach is in
one sense a cousin of Rule 2b. The major difference is that here the
taxpayers are paying for public interest programming (at the same time that
they receive money from the sale of the spectrum), rather than
"broadcasters." The most important difference is therefore distributional.
As noted above, that difference is more complex than it seems in light of
the fact that when a burden is imposed on "broadcasters," their advertisers
are likely to be paying much of the bill, and the result will be complex
effects on consumers, on other communications outlets, and on advertising
choices. There is no simple redistribution, in Rule 2b, from "broadcasters"
to the "public."</p>

        <p>Comment: This should also decrease the amount paid for the
entitlement, as compared with Rule 5a. This is a "play or pay" version of Rules
5a and 5b. The problem here lies in determining the level of any such
"damage award." This approach is in one sense a cousin of Rule 2a, as a
"play or pay" system.</p>
        <p>A full understanding of these possibilities would greatly facilitate
both conceptual and empirical inquiry. Undoubtedly a choice among the
various options should depend partly on the particular public interest
obligation involved; for example, a requirement of emergency warnings
might take the form of Rule 1, whereas a requirement of free air time for
candidates might be some combination of Rules 1, 2b, and 5b. The analysis
thus far suggests that Rules 2b and 5b have special advantages over the
alternatives. Rule 2b, the basic "play or pay" system, seems well-suited to
the current period, as a kind of interim improvement over the regulatory
status quo. In some areas, Rule 5b may well be better in the longer term, as
broadcasters come to resemble general-interest magazines. Movement in
the direction of selling the spectrum, rather than giving it away to
preselected owners, would also be highly desirable.</p>

        <title>A BriefNote on CulturalPoliciesand CulturalSubsidies</title>
        <p>The immediately preceding discussion raises obvious questions about
when and whether it is appropriate for the government to devote collective
resources to the promotion of a better cult-are, and in particular, to
promotion of a better democratic order. A "cultural policy" might, for example,
involve the use of taxpayer funds to promote opera or high art, perhaps by
subsidizing musicians and artists, perhaps by making it easier for poor
people and children to afford to go, perhaps by creating a situation in
which people can attend at vastly reduced rates or even for free. In
Washington, D.C., for example, people can attend public museums,
including those devoted to historical and democratic issues, for free, a
practice that creates a distinctive atmosphere for people who visit the
nation's capitol. Such visits would have a different tone if, for example, it
were necessary to pay three dollars to attend the National Archives, which
house the original Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Bill of
Rights.</p>
        <p>The general topic of public funding of cultural endeavors is highly
controversial and has received considerable attention.1" The discussion
thus far suggests, at a minimum, that such policies should be less
controversial when individual consumption choices involve a collective action
problem, or when in their capacity as citizens, most people urge their
government to promote some activity in order to promote genuinely public
aspirations. The argument is most secure when those aspirations involve
democracy itself. There is reason for the government to support
programming that promotes public education about civic affairs, whether or not that
programming is provided by markets themselves; and at a minimum,
government subsidies of this kind are firmly supported on theoretical
grounds.2 ®</p>

VOLUNTARY SELF-REGULATION: ASPIRATIONS, TRUSTEES, AND
'WINNER-TAKE-LEss" CODES</p>
        <p>In this Part, I discuss the possibility of promoting public interest goals
through voluntary self-regulation, as through a "code" of conduct to be
issued and enforced by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), or
199. See, e.g., Ronald Dworkin, Can A Liberal State SupportArt?, in A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE
221,221-35 (1985).</p>
        <p>200. See Baker, supranote 60, at 383-408.
perhaps by a wider range of those who produce television for the American
public. The idea of voluntary self-regulation--of television and content on
the Internet-has received growing attention in many nations."0 ' For many
decades, in fact, the NAB did indeed impose a code, partly to promote its
economic interest (by raising the price of advertising), partly to fend off
regulation (by showing that the industry was engaged in self-regulation),
and partly to carry out the moral commitments of broadcasters
themselves.' And voluntary self-regulation has played a role in numerous areas
of media policy, including, for example, cigarette advertising, children's
advertising, family viewing, advertising of hard liquor, and fairness in
news reporting.0' A code has a great deal of potential. Above all, it could
address a far greater number of problems than could an economic incentive
(for First Amendment reasons), and it appears to have far more potential
for producing good, and reducing bad, than a disclosure requirement.</p>
        <p>For example, a code could address all public interest obligations
mentioned thus far, but also attempt to protect against sexually violent
material, against subliminal advertising, against sensationalistic treatment
of politics, and against a wide range of other problems with television. The
question is whether it is possible, in the current era, for broadcasters to
overcome some of the unfortunate effects of the marketplace with
voluntary measures. An underlying question, likely to be faced in many areas of
regulatory policy both domestically and internationally, is whether a code
would work as a kind of unfortunate cartelization or instead as protection
against an undesirable "race to the bottom."</p>
        <p>A code might do a great deal of good, partly because of the likely
existence of external monitors, partly because of a code's capacity to help
develop a kind of internal morality likely to affect many of its signatories.
A general lesson is that the antitrust laws ought not to be invoked too
readily to prevent producers from undertaking cooperative action in
circumstances in which competition is producing palpable social harms. In such
contexts, a code can provide some of the advantages of government
regulation, but do so in a more flexible and better-informed fashion. It is
hazardous to invoke the antitrust laws to prevent an industry from
providing the kinds of benefits that might be provided, more crudely and
expensively, by direct regulation.20</p>

        <title>The Problemanda Recently Emerging Strategy</title>
        <p>Notwithstanding the qualifications described above, competitive
pressures often can and do provide programming that people would like to see.
In an era of cable and satellite television, and an increasingly large range of
options, competitive pressures will be especially important in producing
"niche" programming for people who have a particular interest in serious
programming. The communications market increasingly resembles the
market for magazines; recall the possibility, in a digital market, of over one
thousand stations. But competitive pressures have a downside. They can
lead to sensationalistic, prurient, or violent programming, and to a failure
to provide sufficient attention to educational values, or to the kind of
programming that is indispensable to a well-functioning democracy. °s This is
so especially in light of the fact that a small relative advantage can lead to
huge increases in viewers, a fact that presses television in tabloid-like
directions. As Robert Frank and Philip Cook have suggested,
[i]ncreasingly impoverished political debate is yet another cost of
our current cultural trajectory. Complex modem societies generate
complex economic and social problems, and the task of choosing
the best course is difficult under the best of circumstances. And yet,
as in-depth analysis and commentary give way to sound bites in
which rival journalists and politicians mercilessly ravage one
another, we become an increasingly ill-informed and ill-tempered
electorate.2"</p>
        <p>It would be possible to respond to the harmful effects of competitive
pressures in various ways. Probably the simplest response would take the
form of voluntary self-regulation, through some kind of "code" of good
programming; this approach is specifically designed to respond to the
problems that can be introduced by market pressures. In various nations,
including the United States, cooperative action has played a constructive
role in situations of this kind.2" Though it has yet to receive much
academic commentary,2 s voluntary self-regulation via industry agreements is
emerging as a regulatory strategy of choice, especially in the
environmental arena?° The EPA, for example, has encouraged companies that
produce pesticides to agree on pesticide reduction strategies, and here

the fact of broad agreement is crucial."' California has attempted to deal
with the problem of workplace accidents via a "cooperative compliance
program" involving self-enforced safety plans on large construction
projects. The result has been a significant drop in accident rates.2"'
Selfregulating agreements are now in place in Canada's system for forest
management; in the Responsible Care program of the chemical industry, now
operating in more than forty countries; and in national regulation of
nuclear power plants 12</p>
        <p>What accounts for the increasing popularity of industry
selfregulation, as part of the general project of "reinventing government"?1 3
From the industry's standpoint, self-regulation allows far more flexibility
than government mandates. From the standpoint of government, a special
advantage of codes is that they avoid the kind of informational overload
that comes from government prescriptions.214 It is partly for this reason that
voluntary agreements among companies have had good effects in the area
of occupational safety and health?15 In a point of special relevance to
television, codes also have been found to have the power to influence
community attitudes in a way that tends to contribute to the development of a
custodial ethic.216 Thus, codes have helped to develop an institutional
morality that brings the behavior of industry members within a normative
framework2. 17</p>
        <p>Such cooperative action raises concerns about antitrust violations and
self-interested profit-seeking under a public-spirited guise. This is of
course a risk, but the antitrust law can go wrong when it prevents
cooperative action that overcomes palpably adverse effects of market pressures.
Indeed, the International Standards Organization is designed specifically to
ensure a form of cooperation to overcome those adverse effects; 28 the
question is whether that experience has communications analogues.

        <title>B. A Code: Sample Provisions</title>
        <p>The question is whether it might be possible to adopt a new code for
broadcasting, specifically designed for the new communications market.
There have been many precursors for voluntary self-regulation via codes."
A new code might update the old NAB code, and help overcome current
problems, without having the degree of tepidness of the existing
"standards." A code might even promote some of the goals associated with
deliberative democracy.</p>
        <p>What provisions might a new code include? The appropriate level of
specificity is an important concern; especially clear provisions ("three
hours of educational programming per week") risk excessive rigidity,
whereas vague provisions ("reasonable efforts to provide educational
programming for children") risk meaninglessness. Discussions of
codemaking in general have stressed the need for "the public announcement of
the principles and practices that the industry presumptively accepts as
a guide to appropriate conduct and also as a basis for evaluating and
criticizing performance."' This point argues in favor of a degree of
specificity.</p>
        <p>Consider the following possible code provisions, simply for the
sake of illustration:
1. Each broadcaster shall provide three hours of free air time for
candidates during the two-month period preceding the election.</p>
        <p>In return for free air time, candidates shall discuss substantive
labour, forced labour, health and safety, trade union rights, discrimination, discipline,
working hours, and pay.... As the name SA8000 suggests, it is the first to be modelled on
existing and widely accepted commercial standards such as IS09000, drawn up by the
International Standards Organisation in Geneva, which is used to determine whether
companies have the management systems to meet required product quality. But the real
strength of the new approach is commercial sanctions. A company which adopts the code
also agrees to be independently inspected to see whether it is abiding by the conditions laid
down. It will be able to attract customers and gain a competitive advantage by advertising the
fact that its factories and suppliers meet the standard.

issues in a substantive way and must provide something other
than short "sound bites."
2. Each broadcaster shall provide one hour of educational
programming for children each day. Broadcasters shall attempt to
ensure that children are not exposed to excessively violent
programming or programming that is otherwise harmful to, or
inappropriate for, children. Broadcasters shall avoid programming
that encourages criminal or self-destructive behavior; they
should also be sensitive in presenting sexual material that
children might encounter.
3. News coverage shall be substantive and issue-oriented. It should
not emphasize the sensational and the prurient. It should concern
itself with claims and disagreements on matters of substance.
Consistent with the exercise of legitimate station discretion,
stations should not give excessive or undue attention to sensational
accusations, or to reports of "who is ahead in the polls," at the
expense of other issues.
4. Morbid, sensationalistic, or alarming details not essential to a
factual report, especially in connection with stories of crime or
sex, should be avoided. News should be broadcast in such a
manner as to avoid panic and unnecessary alarm. News
programming should attempt to avoid prurience, sensationalism, and
gossip. Stations should make an effort to devote enough time to
public issues to permit genuine understanding of problems and
disagreements.
5. Violence should be portrayed responsibly and not exploitatively.</p>
        <p>Presentation of violence should avoid the excessive, the
gratuitous, the humiliating, and the instructional. The use of violence
for its own sake and the detailed dwelling upon brutality or
physical agony, by sight or sound, should be avoided. Programs
involving violence should venture to present the consequences to
its victims and perpetrators. Particular care should be exercised
where children may see, or are involved in, the depiction of
violent behavior. Programs should not present rape, sexual assault,
or sexual violence in an attractive or exploitative light.
6. Broadcasters shall ensure that their programming is responsive to
the needs of citizens with disabilities. To this end, broadcasters
shall ensure that programming is accessible, through the
provision of closed captioning and other means, to the extent that
doing so does not impose an undue burden on the broadcaster.
Particular efforts should be made to provide full access to news
and public affairs programming. Hearing impaired citizens are</p>
        <p>sometimes at risk of a form of disenfranchisement, or even
physical danger, because steps are not taken to ensure that
television broadcasting is available to them. Stations should take
special steps to ensure that information about disasters and
emergencies is fully accessible to those who are hearing
impaired, ideally in "real time."
Broadcasters shall cover international as well as domestic
questions and give appropriate coverage to important events in other
nations. They should recognize that purely national questions are
often hard to evaluate without an understanding of the practices
of others, and also that many questions, including those of war
and peace, cannot be well-understood without the kind of
background that comes from suitable attention to developments
and events abroad.</p>

        <p>Such a code would of course raise many questions. The first would
involve the problem of enforcement. Without an enforcement mechanism,
a code might have no effect at all, indeed it might be a form of public
deception.' The enforcement question is a central part of the general
inquiry into the preconditions for effective self-regulation. 4</p>
        <p>
          There are several obvious possibilities. The simplest would be for the
NAB to undertake enforcement on its own, just as it did under the old
code. It might, for example, give a seal of approval to those who are shown
to comply with its provisions and deny a seal of approval to those who
have been shown not to have complied. The NAB might also give special
public recognition to those stations that have compiled an excellent public
service record in the past year. Such recognition might be awarded for,
among other things, meeting the needs of children in a sustained and
creative way; offering substantive and extended coverage of elections,
including interviews, free air time, and debates; offering substantive and
extended coverage of public issues; and providing opportunities for
discussion of problems facing the local community. At the time of license
renewal, a notation might be given to the FCC that there has been
compliance or continuing or egregious noncompliance with the code. If the
NAB is unwilling to enforce a code of this kind,225 perhaps a private group

AND LAW 91 (C. Cody &amp; C. Sampford eds., 1993) (discussing need for enforcement mechanisms);

          and January 1999, the NAB decided not to oppose the idea of a code
publicly and officially, but did suggest "serious concern" about any government effort to interfere with
could take the initiative, both promulgating the code and publicizing it, and
in that (modest) sense sanctioning violations. 6 A special problem here is
that in light of increasing competition from nonbroadcast programming
sources, a code would not be in the economic interest of broadcasters even
if generally adopted, and this is an unpromising fact for a code's
effectiveness? 7 Perhaps supplemental enforcement will come from rivals
of those who defect from the agreement and violate the code; this is a
reasonable prediction in theory, and something similar has been found in
analogous areas."
        </p>
        <p>Any enforcement by the NAB or even a private monitoring group
would be most likely to succeed if accompanied by external pressures of
one sort or another. As in the case of disclosure requirements, the most
promising possibilities include public interest groups able to mobilize
relevant social norms and to focus media attention on derelict actors. 229
Perhaps such activity would be accompanied by market pressures of various
sorts, as consumer action has had significant effects on code enforcement
in related areas 3 0 A degree of FCC interest in the existence of code
violations would also help.</p>
        <p>These points raise a related question: the appropriate scope of any
such code. Undoubtedly such a code was less painful and easier to operate
when three broadcasters exhausted the universe of television. Broadcasters
now find themselves in competition with many other entertainment
sources, including cable and the Internet. In these circumstances,
broadcasters are not likely to constrain themselves if their competitors are
not similarly constrained; the competition for an audience for news is
much affected by the existence of "tabloid television," and a rule limited
to broadcasters would raise an obvious question about fairness. A
broadcaster who ties himself to the mast may find himself with a significantly
reduced audience. This point suggests that in the development of a code,
broadcasters should perhaps be joined by the National Association of
Cable Television.</p>
        <p>By itself, however, a code limited to broadcasters should do
considerable good, even if some broadcasters are reluctant to subscribe to it. When
the market reaches the stage in which broadcasters are merely some of a
editorial freedom. See Paige Albiniak, Preparingfor Battle,BROADCASTING &amp; CABLE, July 6, 1998, at
22; FoxStill Undecidedon LeavingNAB, ExpressesConcerns,CoMM. DAiLY, Jan. 14, 1999, at 6.</p>
        <p>226. This approach would have special advantages in light of the fact that some stations are not
members of the NAB. For NAB stations that must compete with nonmember stations, a code creates an
obvious competitive risk, and there is a continuing question whether it is possible to design strategies,
public or private, to combat this risk.</p>

large number of providers, with no distinctive status, it might make sense
to think of a more general code (with suitable adjustments for particular
kinds of programmers).3 1 It is worth underlining the point that, as in the
context of disclosure, the likelihood of success will increase with the
existence of third-party monitors, both public and private, and also with a
threat of more intrusive action should it prove necessary.3 2</p>

        <title>D. Notes on the FirstAmendment and AntitrustLaw</title>
        <p>A code for television broadcasters might be thought to raise issues
of both constitutional and antitrust law. The constitutional issues are
relatively straightforward; the antitrust issues are a bit more complex. I
offer a brief discussion here.</p>
        <p>There is essentially no risk that a code of the sort suggested here
would create serious First Amendment problems. By itself, a code is a
private set of guidelines, and private guidelines by themselves raise no First
Amendment issue- 3 If a private group decides to impose restrictions on
the speech of its members, and government is not involved, the First
Amendment is irrelevant.' Of course things would be different if
government mandated any such code.</p>
        <p>Nor would provisions like those described above be likely to violate
the antitrust laws. The Department of Justice has so concluded, as have
district courts in two important cases in which the private antitrust actions
at issue involved parts of previous codes. The district court in American</p>

standards reasonable and in the public interest. As I have noted, the most
231. For example, it is hardly clear that a station devoted to children should be required to provide
free air time for political candidates.</p>

Brooks, 436 U.S. 149 (1978) (noting that a private contract raises no First Amendment issue). If a code
is a product of government threat, and is effectively required by government, the First Amendment
comes into play. There can be no question that a governmentally mandated code, not voluntary but
taking the form outlined here, would raise legitimate constitutional problems. This does not necessarily
mean that the First Amendment would be violated, but it does mean that the code would have to be
tested for compliance with First Amendment principles, including constitutional limits on content
regulation.</p>

recent code's disintegration came at the hand of a 1979 antitrust action, in
which the Department of Justice alleged that certain Code provisions
violated the Sherman Act. But the Justice Department's complaint was quite
narrow, and the court's decision 7 would not invalidate a code of the sort
suggested here." The television market's unique characteristics would
allow a code of the sort porposed here to survive a "rule of reason" inquiry,
which requires balancing of the relevant factors. It would be most
reasonable to hold that any restrictions contained in the code would promote
competition as well as various public interests goals, such as education of
children, access for the handicapped, and other civic functions.239
E.</p>
        <p>We are now in a position to disentangle the two puzzles discussed in
Part I.B above. Why were broadcasters pleased that the proposed NAB
code would violate antitrust laws? Why did they prefer rigid government
mandates to a flexible, "play or pay" approach? The broadcasters on the
Committee favored a code partly because they thought it a good idea
in principle and partly because they had little to lose from it. Though
generally "winners," they were selected for the Committee because of their
commitment, through both words and deeds, to moderating some of the
adverse effects of competition. They were vulnerable to "winner-take-all"
effects insofar as they were reluctant to engage in certain competitive
practices. In this way, a code might even help them. But the NAB would
not like a meaningful code at all. The broadcasting industry as a whole
would be hurt by such a code, especially because cable television would
not be bound by it. Why should broadcasters, in an intensely competitive
market, give a significant edge to cable? Especially if the result would be
that cable could take a lot more, of the viewing audience than it now does?
It is not surprising if broadcasters who supply a large degree of public
interest programming believe that they would be net winners with a
codeand if the broadcasting industry as a whole believes that it would be a net
loser. Such an industry, cautious about invoking its own economic interest
alone, is all too likely to invoke the antitrust laws (or the First Amendment)
for purely strategic and self-interested reasons.</p>
        <p>This point also helps explain the Committee broadcasters' skepticism
about "play or pay" alternatives. A set of rigid public interest requirements
does not hurt them and may even help them, insofar as it places their
competitors under legal duties that they would themselves meet voluntarily
(because of their aspirations or because of the particular demands of their
audience and their advertisers). A system of "play or pay" would mean that

        <p>See id. at 120-21.
these broadcasters would be undercut by competitors who, unwilling to
play, would pay-and capture a large audience share, in a version of
"winner-take-most." But this is not a convincing objection to a system of
"play or pay." It is true that some of those who "play" will be at a
competitive disadvantage with respect to some of those who "pay" others to
play instead. But by itself this competitive disadvantage is not worthy of
concern, any more than we should be concerned when, in the
environmental context, some of those who reduce pollution are at a competitive
disadvantage with respect to those who, instead of reducing pollution, pay
a substantial fee to third parties who have reduced pollution. The question
is what approach yields the best outcome for the public. If there is too little
public interest broadcasting, or too much pollution, the solution is not the
simple command to "play," or to "reduce," but to increase the price for
failing to play or for failing to reduce.2</p>
        <p>The best defense of a code of the sort I have discussed is that it would
produce "winner-take-less" outcomes, in a way that would provide
significant benefits for the public by diminishing some of the adverse
effects of market competition and by strengthening broadcaster norms in
favor of obligations to children and to democratic values. And if this is so,
it provides a general lesson about how voluntary private action might
sometimes handle problems usually dealt with by direct regulation-and a
lesson about the reflexive use of the antitrust laws to prevent producer
cooperation. A key question is whether mechanisms might be created to
ensure compliance with any such code.</p>
        <p>VII</p>
        <p>A SUMMARY</p>
        <p>This discussion has ranged over a number of regulatory tools, and it
may be helpful, by way of summary, to discuss them all briefly and at
once. We have seen that both disclosure and codes have the advantage of
ensuring a minimal government role, in a way that reduces constitutional
concerns and also allows a high degree of flexibility. The danger is that
these remedies will have little effect; here the key question is whether there
are good external monitors, able to impose reputational or other costs on
those who do poorly. We have also seen that "taxes" on programming that
does not serve public interest goals, and subsidies to programming that
does serve such goals, can have similar effects. A principal problem with
subsidies is that they create an incentive not to provide such programming
voluntarily. The following table charts the basic territory:</p>

        <p>Some of these tools could serve as complements rather than as
alternatives. Disclosure makes sense with or without additional strategies. It
should be the least controversial item on the list; the only real question is
what else should accompany it. Disclosure is likely to work especially well
in tandem with voluntary self-regulation, indeed the two tools are natural
allies. By contrast, mandates and economic incentives are genuine
competitors, and in the current context, economic incentives generally seem
best, with mandates operating as a "backstop," probably to be eliminated in
the long term.24</p>
        <p>As I have emphasized, these recommendations are designed for the
current stage of telecommunications technology; they are also likely to
make sense for the near term. For the next decade, the key question is
whether initiatives designed for broadcasters should be applied to cable
programmers as well (especially disclosure and compliance with a code).
In the very long term, when broadcasters occupy no special role, it may be
best to impose disclosure requirements on general-interest stations, and
also to subsidize high-quality programming of various sorts. A reasonable
conclusion would be that in the long-term, public interest programming
will be best promoted via subsidies, not through regulation of any kind. In
such an era, much will have been gained and much will also have been
lost, with the fragmentation of the television market, with less in the way
of common experiences, and, possibly, with less frequent exposure to
serious coverage of serious issues0 2 It is too soon to know whether the very
long term will come in the next decade or long thereafter2.43</p>
        <p>One final note: The discussion here has been focused on law, not on
norms or culture; but the argument for a certain conception of the social
role of television bears at least as much on norms and culture as on law. It
is possible to think that before long, it will not make sense to impose
regulatory requirements on CBS, NBC, ABC, and Fox, any more than it
makes sense to impose regulatory requirements on Newsweek, Time, The</p>

      <sec id="sec-3-2">
        <title>New York Times, USA Today, NationalReview, or The New Republic. I</title>
        <p>have argued against this conclusion, but it must be taken seriously. Even if
it is accepted, it is crucial to say that those who provide television, like
those who produce newspapers and magazines, have a distinctive cultural
responsibility, associated with the promotion of a democratic culture.
Many people not subject to regulation take this responsibility seriously;
many do not. If law diminishes as a constraining force, it is all the more
important to speak on behalf of the basic norms-protection of children,
241. For an overlapping discussion, emphasizing the value of "industry mixes" in the context of
environmental law, see GUNNINGHAM ET AL., supra note 20, at 422-48.</p>
        <p>242. See LEssIG, supra note 66, at 185-86.</p>

the suggestion that the Internet may never become an important means of delivering television).
serious attention to serious issues, inclusion of a wide variety of social
groups, including the hearing impaired-that have undergirded regulatory
law in the past. If it flourishes, a "trustee culture" can do much of the work
of the law.</p>
        <p>CONCLUSION</p>
        <p>Much of the discussion here has involved appropriate regulatory tools.
For the most part, the policy instruments of choice should not involve rigid
dictates or commands, which are expensive and potentially
counterproductive, and in any case ill-suited to an era of rapidly changing technology. I
have suggested a strong preference for the less intrusive options of
disclosure, economic incentives, and voluntary self-regulation. Disclosure has
been a surprisingly successful, low-cost strategy in other areas of
regulatory law. If certain broadcasting is seen as a public good, analogous to
clean air, economic incentives may be able to accomplish a good deal, and
to do so at relatively low cost. Because competitive pressures are
frequently the engine behind poor broadcaster performance, voluntary
selfregulation may turn out to be a desirable kind of "cartel," helping to
counteract short-term interests. Through this route it may be possible to develop
an intermediate system of controls, responding to the market and
nonmarket failures of current markets, but without introducing the rigidity and
inefficiencies of command-and-control regulation. These points hold
notwithstanding current and anticipated technological developments.2 Of
course, the appropriate attitude toward such instruments is pragmatic,
empirical, and experimental, rather than dogmatic or theological. If these
instruments fail to work, it will be worthwhile to consider alternatives.</p>
        <p>If measures of this kind have promise in the areas of environmental
protection and public interest programming, there is every reason to
explore them in other, less familiar contexts as well. In many areas of law,
command-and-control regulation has proved a partial or complete failure,
and the natural alternative-a system of well-defined property rights and
freedom of contract-may produce serious problems of its own. In such
circumstances, any "third way," if it is ultimately to develop for the
modem regulatory state, is likely to place heavy reliance on disclosure,
economic incentives, and voluntary self-regulation.</p>
        <p>244. See Goldberg et al., supranote 5, at 296 (footnote omitted), arguing that:</p>
        <p>A further point of some importance is that there is no single new media form or market, and
there is never likely to be such uniformity. Markets remain distinct; for example there is still
a clear distinction between television-type services and on-line services. Technological
convergence may be imminent in the form of television Internet access (or Web TV)
becoming cheaply available, but the cultures remain radically different. Indeed, in the context
of television, it seems likely that, though delivery forms may change, the culture may not,
and that new types of media may supplement rather than replace existing ones. Again the
message is one ofcaution before we scrap existing regulatory arrangements.</p>
        <p>The most fundamental points involve the appropriate understanding of
a system of free expression-an understanding of what gives such a system
its motivation and point. I have emphasized the external benefits that come
from public interest programming and also the peculiar characteristics of
the television market, where viewers, or eyeballs, are a commodity
provided to advertisers. Because of the collective action problem, regulatory
efforts that attempt to promote democratic goals, or that provide captioning
for the hearing impaired, are easily defended in principle. But I have also
argued that purely economic principles should be rejected as the
foundation for communications policy. With respect to public interest
programming, viewers' tastes may be a product of an undesirable set of
communications options, and in their capacity as citizens, people may weli
want to make things better rather than worse. Especially in light of the role
of the communications media in the production of culture-and on both
preferences and values-it is entirely legitimate for a democratic
government to refuse to make "consumption choices" the exclusive basis for
policy design. I have emphasized that a public committed to deliberative
democracy might well support initiatives designed to provide better
programming for children and better coverage of public issues. 45 So long as
they are subject to democratic control, such initiatives should be regarded
not as a paternalistic interference with private choices by a regulatory elite,
but as an effort by a self-governing public to promote a political culture
that is consistent with its own highest aspirations. Above all, this is the
sense in which there is a difference between the public interest and what
interests the public.</p>
