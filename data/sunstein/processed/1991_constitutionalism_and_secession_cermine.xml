      <p>The Soviet Constitution guarantees a right to secede.' The
American Constitution does not. Although some secessionists in
the American South, invoking state sovereignty, claimed to find an
implicit right to secede in the founding document, it was more
common to invoke an extratextual and nonjusticiable "right to
secede" said to be enshrined in the Declaration of Independence.' In
any case, no serious scholar or politician now argues that a right to
secede exists under American constitutional law.3 It is generally
agreed that such a right would undermine the Madisonian spirit of
the original document, one that encourages the development of
constitutional provisions that prevent the defeat of the basic
enterprise.4</p>
      <p>Eastern European countries are now deciding about the
contents of proposed constitutions. They are often doing so in the
context of profound cultural and ethnic divisions, both often defined
at least roughly in territorial terms. These divisions have propelled

3 As a formal matter of constitutional interpretation, the issue has been settled since
Texas v White, 74 US 700, 724-26 (1869) (holding secession of Texas from the Union
unconstitutional because the states' acceptance of the federal Constitution represented a waiver of
the right to secede). See also Akhil Reed Amar, Some New World Lessons for the Old

the fundamental law of all national governments.... [N]o government proper ever had a
provision in its organic law for its own termination." First Inaugural Address (Mar 4, 1861),

claims for local self-determination that could readily be
transformed into attempts to guarantee a right to secede or even into
secession itself. In Eastern Europe in particular, debates over the
right to secede have already played an extraordinarily important
role in discussions of new institutional arrangements. Various
political actors have vigorously asserted a right to secede in
Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and the Czech and Slovak Republics.5 Active
secession movements have played a central role in current efforts
to establish democratic governance. Such movements have led to
claims for a constitutional right to secede, paralleling the Soviet
right but to be respected in practice. A draft of the Slovak
constitution, for example, creates a right to secede.6</p>
      <p>It is likely that these claims will be asserted all the more
vigorously in the future. The claims for secession, or for a right to
secede, raise exceptionally large questions about the theory and
practice of constitutionalism. It is therefore an especially important
time to explore the relationship between secession claims and
constitutionalism in general.</p>
      <p>My principal claim in this essay is that whether or not
secession might be justified as a matter of politics or morality,
constitutions ought not to include a right to secede. To place such a right
in a founding document would increase the risks of ethnic and
factional struggle; reduce the prospects for compromise and
deliberation in government; raise dramatically the stakes of day-to-day
political decisions; introduce irrelevant and illegitimate
considerations into those decisions; create dangers of blackmail,
strategic behavior, and exploitation; and, most generally, endanger
the prospects for long-term self-governance.8 Constitutionalism,
5 See, for example, Celestine Bohlen, East Europe's Past Imperils 3 Nations, NY
Times A16 (Dec 16, 1990) ("EastEurope'sPast"). The Croatian Parliament has adopted a
constitution that would give it a right to secede from Yugoslavia upon a two-thirds vote of
the local legislature and a simple majority vote in a plebiscite. See CroatiaTakes the Right
to Secede, NY Times A9 (Dec 22, 1990). In October 1990, Slovenia passed a constitutional
amendment creating a right to secede.</p>
      <p>There are active secession movements elsewhere-in Canada and India, for
example-and while I do not explore them here, this article bears on the issue of secession
generally.</p>
      <p>See Draft Constitution of the Slovak Republic, Arts 2, 7 (on file with U Chi L Rev)..</p>
      <p>It would follow that courts should not find such a right to be implicit in constitutions.
8 Lincoln made many of these arguments:
Plainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy. A majority held in
restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with
deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free
people. Whoever rejects it does, of necessiy, fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity
is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly
inembodying as it does a set of precommitment strategies, is
frequently directed against risks of precisely this sort. Political or
moral claims for secession are frequently powerful, but they do not
justify constitutional recognition of a secession right.</p>
      <p>The principal argument for recognition of a right to secede is
that it would operate as a powerful deterrent to oppressive and
discriminatory practices, and also serve as an effective remedy for
these practices. Usually, however, these goals can be promoted
through other, more direct means. If they cannot be, a negotiated
agreement embodying secession or a right of revolution-also not
recognized in founding texts-is a preferable safeguard. The
opportunity for a negotiated agreement or a right of revolution would
provide a remedy against most of the relevant abuses without
raising the continuous risks to self-government that would be created
by a constitutional right to secede.</p>
      <p>In the process of making this argument, I hope also to
disentangle the various possible grounds for a moral claim to secession
and to indicate which of those grounds have force in different
contexts. Some of the discussion will provide support for the view that
secession is often justified as a matter of political morality. In such
cases I argue against national efforts to stop secession through
military or other action.</p>
      <p>In Part I, I discuss constitutions as precommitment strategies,
designed to foreclose debate over certain fundamental questions.
These strategies should often be seen as enabling rather than
constraining, that is, as devices not only for limiting government, but
also for facilitating the difficult process of self-government. This
argument has powerful roots in the American constitutional
tradition and applies with particular force in the context of secession.
The argument also has general implications for the theory of what
does and does not belong in constitutions. This theory remains in a
surprisingly primitive state, and I will venture some preliminary
remarks on the subject.</p>
      <p>In Part II, I discuss reasons why a subunit of a nation might
want to secede, and provide a brief assessment of those reasons as
a matter of political morality. My conclusion is that those reasons
often create a strong moral claim for secession. Even when this is
so, however, the creation of a right to secede in a founding
docuadmissable; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy or despotism in some
form is all that is left.</p>

note 4).
ment is usually unjustified. Part III discusses qualified rights to
secession, arguing that even though these are superior to a general
right of exit for subunits, they are inferior to an across-the-board
waiver of that right by all subunits in a nation.9</p>
      <p>I. CONSTITUTIONS AS PRECOMMITMENT STRATEGIES</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>A. In General: Notes on Constitutionalism</title>
      <p>It is often said that constitutionalism is in considerable
tension with democracy. Thomas Jefferson was emphatic on the point,
arguing that constitutions should be amended by each generation
in order to ensure that the dead past would not constrain the
living present. 10 Many contemporary observers echo the Jeffersonian
position, claiming that constitutional constraints often amount to
unjustified, antidemocratic limits on the power of the present and
future.1 Responding to Jefferson, James Madison argued that a
constitution subject to frequent amendment would promote
factionalism and provide no firm basis for republican
selfgovernment. 2</p>
      <p>Madison envisioned firm and lasting constitutional constraints
as a precondition for democratic processes, rather than a check on
them. This vision captures a central goal of American
constitutionalism: to ensure the conditions for the peaceful, long-term
operation of democracy in the face of often-persistent social differences
and plurality along religious, ethnic, cultural, and other lines. This
goal is highly relevant to constitutional developments in Eastern
Europe, where religious and ethnic hostilities are especially
intense. Madison saw differences and diversity as strengths rather
than weaknesses, if channeled through constitutional structures
that would promote deliberation and lead groups to check, rather
than exploit, other groups. It may be possible for Eastern
European countries to replicate this approach, although they face far
more profound differences of language, ethnicity, history, and
religion than those that confronted the Framers of our Constitution.</p>
      <p>To approach the question of secession, it will be useful to
provide a brief outline of some of the reasons for entrenching
institutional arrangements and substantive rights.' 3 On such questions,
constitutional theory remains in a surprisingly primitive state.14 I
begin by examining what sorts of considerations might lead people
forming a new government to place basic rights and arrangements
beyond the reach of ordinary politics. The crucial idea here is that
for various reasons, people in a newly formed nation might attempt
to do so as part of a precommitment strategy.</p>
      <p>Some rights are entrenched because of a belief that they are in
some sense pre- or extra-political, that is, because individuals
ought to be allowed to exercise them regardless of what majorities
might think. Some of these rights are entrenched for reasons
entirely independent of democracy. Here constitutionalism is indeed
a self-conscious check on self-government, attempting to immunize
a private sphere from public power. Plausible examples include the
rights to private property,15 freedom from self-incrimination,
bodily integrity, protection against torture or cruel punishment, and
privacy.</p>
      <p>But many of the rights that are constitutionally entrenched
actually derive from the principle of democracy itself. Their
protection from majoritarian processes follows from and creates no
tension with the goal of self-determination through politics. The
precommitment strategy permits the people to protect democratic
processes against their own potential excesses or misjudgments.
The right to freedom of speech and the right to vote are familiar
illustrations. Constitutional protection of these rights is not at
odds with the commitment to self-government but instead a logical
part of it.' 6</p>
      <p>'a By using the word "entrenching" here and elsewhere, I refer to simple
constitutionalization, not to a decision to immunize a constitutional provision from amendment. I assume
throughout that constitutional provisions are much more difficult to change than ordinary
statutes, but nonethelsss amendable if there is a consensus that they should be.</p>
      <p>"' For a valuable collection of essays on this topic, see Jon Elster and Rune Slagstad,
eds, Constitutionalism and Democracy (Cambridge, 1988).</p>
      <p>" The right to property is an ambiguous case; it is a democratic right as well as a
private one. Private property provides for security and independence from government, and
these are preconditions for citizenship-a theme that played a large role in republican
thought. See J.G.A. Pocock, ed, The PoliticalWorks of JamesHarrington53-63, 67-68,
14452 (Cambridge, 1977).</p>
      <p>16 For an extended elaboration of this theme, see John Hart Ely, Democracy and
Dis</p>
      <p>Institutional arrangements can also be understood as an effort
to protect a private sphere from majoritarianism. Often this effort
stems from a fear of democratic processes. A decision to divide
government among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches
might be regarded as an effort to check and limit government by
requiring a consensus among all three before the state can interfere
with the private sphere. 17 Private liberty flourishes because
government is partially disabled. So too, a federal system might ensure
that the nation and its subunits will check each other, generating a
friction that enables private liberty to flourish.' 8</p>
      <p>Structural provisions of this sort limit the political power of
present majorities (or minorities), and in this sense raise
difficulties for those who believe that the only or principal purpose of
constitutionalism is to provide a framework for, democratic
governance. But if structural provisions are generally seen as
precommitment strategies, some of them can be enabling as well as
constraining. 9 We can understand both individual rights and
structural provisions in this way. Like the rules of grammar, such
provisions set out the rules by which political discussion will occur,
and in that sense free up the participants to conduct their
discussions more easily.</p>
      <p>The system of separation of powers, for example, does not
merely constrain government, but also helps to energize it, and to
make it more effective, by creating a healthy division of labor. This
was a prominent argument during the framing period in America.2 °
A system in which the executive does not bear the burden of
adjudication may well strengthen the executive by removing from it a
task that frequently produces public opprobrium. Indeed, the
entire framework might enable rather than constrain democracy, not
only by creating an energetic executive2 ' but, more fundamentally,
trust (Harvard, 1980).</p>
      <p>17 See Federalist 51 (Madison), in Clinton Rossiter, ed, The FederalistPapers 320-25
(New Am Library, 1961).</p>
      <p>"8See id at 323 (federalism and the separation of powers create a "double security" for
individual rights because "[t]he different governments will control each other, at the same
time that each will be controlled by itself.").</p>
      <p>19 I borrow here from Stephen Holmes, Precommitment,and the paradox of
democracy, in Elster and Slagstad, eds, Constitutionalismand Democracy 195 (cited in note 14),
and Stephen Holmes, Gag rules or the politics of omission, in id at 19.</p>
      <p>" See Arthur S. Miller, An Inquiry into the Relevance of the Intentions of the
Founding Fathers,with Special Emphasis upon the Doctrine of Separationof Powers, 27 Ark L
Rev 583, 588-89 (1973) (efficiency was a principal rationale for the separation of powers, in
the view of influential Framers such as John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, John Jay, and
James Wilson).</p>
      <p>21 See Federalist 70 (Hamilton), in Rossiter, ed, The FederalistPapers 423-31 (cited in
by allowing the sovereign people to pursue a strategy, against their
government, of divide and conquer. So long as it is understood that
no branch of government is actually "the people," a system of
separation of powers can allow the citizenry to monitor and constrain
their inevitably imperfect agents. In general, the entrenchment of
established institutional arrangements enables rather than merely
constrains present and future generations by creating a settled
framework under which people may make decisions.</p>
      <p>Thus far I have suggested that constitutions might create
rights and institutions that follow from some independent theory
of what individuals are owed, that are a natural corollary of the
commitment to democracy, or that help to facilitate the
democratic process by establishing the basic structures under which
political arrangements can take place. Constitutional provisions may
be facilitative in quite another sense: a decision to take certain
issues off the ordinary political agenda may be indispensable to the
political process.22</p>
      <p>For example, the initial decision to create a system of private
property places severe constraints on the scope of any political
deliberations on that fundamental issue, and often serves to keep
issues of private property off the political agenda completely.
Indeed, Madison understood the protection of rights of property
largely as a mechanism for limiting factional conflict in
government, not as a means of protecting "rights" and much less as a
means of ensuring against redistribution.2" The removal of the
issue from politics serves, perhaps ironically, to ensure that politics
may continue.</p>
      <p>So too, a nation might protect questions of religion against
resolution by democratic processes, not only because there is a
right to freedom of religious conscience, but also because the
democratic process works best if the fundamental and potentially
explosive question of religion does not intrude into day-to-day
decisions. More narrowly and no doubt more controversially, the
decision to constitutionalize the right to abortion might be justified
because it minimizes the chances that this intractable and
polariznote 17) (describing need for a vigorous, unitary executive).</p>
      <p>22 See Holmes, Gag rules, in Elster and Slagstad, eds, Constitutionalismand
Democracy (cited in note 14).</p>
      <p>'3 See Meyers, ed, The Mind of the Founder 502-09 (cited in note 12). In fact, the
failure of the Framers to eliminate slavery in the original Constitution was attributable to
ideas of this sort. The example reveals that the decision to take an issue off the political
agenda is also a decision to resolve that issue one way rather than another. Such a decision
may well be objectionable on democratic or other grounds.
ing question will intrude into and thus disable the political
process.</p>
      <p>Yet another set of facilitative constitutional precommitment
strategies includes provisions that are designed to solve collective
action problems or prisoners' dilemmas, that is, situations in which
the pursuit of rational self-interest by each individual actor
produces outcomes that are destructive to all actors considered
together, and that could be avoided if all actors agreed in advance to
coercion, assuring cooperation.24 People who are creating their
government might voluntarily waive a right whose existence would
rematerialize, and create serious risks, without the waiver. A decision
to relinquish an otherwise available right advances the interests of
all or most who are involved.2 5</p>
      <p>This idea has played a large role in the American
constitutional experience. The leading example is the Full Faith and
Credit Clause,26 which requires each state to enforce judgments
rendered in other states. Every state might have an incentive to
refuse to enforce the judgments of other states; if Massachusetts
chooses not to honor the judgment of a New'York court against a
Massachusetts citizen, then Massachusetts receives a short-term
gain because the resources its citizen needs to satisfy any judgment
remain within the borders of Massachusetts. But all states would
be better off if the law bound each of them to respect the
judgments of others. The Full Faith and Credit Clause ensures
precisely this outcome, effectively solving a conventional prisoners'
dilemma.</p>
      <p>Another illustration is the Commerce Clause. The Supreme
Court has consistently interpreted the clause as disabling the
states from regulating interstate commerce."' In the period
between the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution, battles
among the states produced mutually destructive tariffs and other
protectionist measures. The adoption of each of these measures
may well have furthered the interest of each state considered in
isolation.29 Collectively, this system proved disastrous.30
24 See generally Jon Elster, The Cement of Society (Cambridge, 1989); Edna
UllmannMargalit, The Emergence of Norms (Oxford, 1977).</p>
      <p>25 Compare Jean Hampton, Hobbes and the Social Contract Tradition (Cambridge,
1986).</p>

27 US Const, Art I, § 8, cl 3 .
28 See, for example, Gibbons v Ogden, 22 US 1 (1824).</p>
      <p>29 Though protectionism can be self-destructive as well, the mere perception of
selfinterest is sufficient for purposes of this argument.</p>
      <p>30 For a standard treatment, see John Fiske, The CriticalPeriod of American History,
1783-89 144-45 (Houghton Mifflin, 1916) ("[T]he different states, with their different tariff</p>
      <p>Especially in light of the strong emotional attachments that
fuel perceptions of state self-interest, a system in which each state
can choose whether to initiate protectionist measures might well
lead many states to do so. But an agreement by all states to refrain
from protectionism, and thus to waive their antecedent right under
the Articles of Confederation, should further the collective
interest. The constitutional decision to remove control of interstate
commerce from state authority solves the problem.3 ' In this case,
as with the Full Faith and Credit Clause, a relinquishment of what
appears to be state sovereignty very likely furthers the interest of
all states concerned.</p>
      <p>This example illustrates both the importance of
precommitment strategies in resolving prisoners' dilemmas, and the potential
value of judicial review in a healthy constitutional system. The
Supreme Court's conclusion that the Commerce Clause contains an
implicit limitation on state power over interstate commerce-a
"negative" federal power-was controversial at first and still raises
thorny problems for the Court from time to time. 2 The Commerce
Clause on its face provides the federal government with only the
positive power to regulate, and locates this power in the legislature,
not the courts. But the negative commerce power follows naturally
from the structural logic of the Constitution. Its enforcement by
the judiciary has been an important means of remaining faithful to
that logic.3 3</p>
      <p>Finally, constitutional precommitment strategies might serve
to overcome myopia or weakness of will on the part of the
collectivity, or to ensure that representatives follow the considered
judgments of the people. Protection of freedom of speech, or from
unand tonnage acts, began to make commercial war upon one another."). For a revisionist
view, see Edmund W. Kitch, Regulation and the American Common Market, in A. Dan
Tarlock, ed, Regulation, Federalism, and Interstate Commerce 9-19 (Oelgeschlager, Gunn
&amp; Hain, 1981) (states under Articles of Confederation actually cooperated to promote
freedom of trade).</p>
      <p>31 There is a close parallel here in the recent experience of the European Community
with regard to the 1992 economic union. See, for example, Wayne Sandholtz and John
Zysman, 1992: Recasting the European Bargain,42 World Pol 95 (1989).</p>
      <p>" See, for example, Hunt v Washington State Apple Advertising Commission,432 US
333 (1977) (North Carolina statute requiring only federal grades on all closed containers of
apples shipped into state violated Commerce Clause because it burdened interstate sales of
Washington apples and discriminated against such sales).</p>
      <p>11 In the United States, judicial review is itself a product of reasoning based on
constitutional structure rather than text. See Marbury v Madison, 5 US 137 (1803). It would be
far simpler, however, to make that power explicit.
reasonable searches and seizures, might represent an effort by the
people themselves to provide safeguards against the impulsive
behavior of majorities. Here the goal is to ensure that the
deliberative sense of the community will prevail over momentary
passions.34 Similarly, a constitution might represent a firm
acknowledgement that the desires of the government, even in a
well-functioning republic, do not always match those of the
people.3 5 Constitutional limits, introduced by something like the
people themselves, therefore respond to the agency problem created
by a system in which government officials inevitably have interests
of their own. This problem arises in all systems of government,
including democracies. In countries emerging from communist rule,
without established principles of democratic representation, it is
likely to pose a special danger, against which constitutional
provisions should guard.</p>
      <p>In all of these cases, the decision to take certain questions off
the political agenda might be understood as a means not of
disabling but of protecting politics, by reducing the power of highly
controversial questions to create factionalism, instability,
impulsiveness, chaos, stalemate, collective action problems, myopia,
strategic behavior, or hostilities so serious and fundamental as to
endanger the governmental process itself. In this respect, the decision
to use constitutionalism to remove certain issues from politics is
often profoundly democratic.</p>
      <p>We can also see many constitutional provisions as mechanisms
for ensuring discussion and deliberation oriented toward
agreement about the general good rather than factionalism and
self-interested bargaining. The states' relinquishment of their preexisting
sovereign right to control the entry and exit of goods is the most
prominent example. But the institutions of representation and
checks and balances have frequently been designed to promote
general discussion and compromise, to diminish the influence of
particular segments of society, and to produce the incentives for
and possibility of agreement. These principles largely guided the
development of the United States Constitution. They bear directly

Slovenia and Croatia. Polls have shown more than 80 percent support
for independence in the Slovenian Republic.3 7 The Slovenian
Parliament voted in February 1991 to "invalidate" all federal laws,
with Slovenian President Milan Kucan claiming that the vote
means that Yugoslavia "has ceased to exist." 8 If Slovenia secedes,
Croatia will probably do so as well. 39 The Croatian Parliament has
given itself veto power over national laws.40 The new Serbian
President, Slobodan Milosevic, is a firm Serbian nationalist who has
awakened fears of oppression among non-Serbs. 41 He has claimed
that "every Serb must live in a Serbian state. '42 Milosevic has
refused to recognize the supremacy of the eight-member Yugoslavian
Presidency.43 The Yugoslavian government has nonetheless
claimed that it may use military force to ensure against secession."
Secessionist pressures may be moving Yugoslavia toward civil
war. 5 Widespread ethnic violence and ultimate disintegration
seem possible," despite recent signs of greater moderation.47</p>
      <p>The federal structure of the Czech and Slovak Federative
Republic is also under considerable pressure. The current solution is
a new provisional, nonconstitutional arrangement that
dramatically limits the authority of the national government, placing it in
the two republics.4 Under the new arrangement, the national
government has power over defense, foreign policy, and monetary
policy, with most other powers placed elsewhere.49</p>
      <p>It appears that only a small percentage of the Slovakians favor
secession.50 In December 1990, however, President Vaclav Havel
sought dramatic new powers to respond to the claim by leaders in
Slovakia that their laws had primacy over those of the national
parliament.5' Vladimir Meciar, until recently the Prime Minister of
the Slovak Republic, had on occasion argued for Slovakian legal
primacy. 52 According to Havel, the consequence of such primacy
would be that "our constitution will be broken and our state would
inevitably fall into legal chaos."5 Indeed, Havel argued, a system
of Slovenian legal primacy would "destabilize all of Europe.15 4</p>
      <p>
        The Soviet Union, of course, is in the most jeopardy of all.
Here some believe that civil war is a realistic threat. In all,
fourteen of the fifteen Soviet republics have asserted their sovereignty
in one form or another. Citizens of the Baltic states and several
other Soviet republics overwhelmingly support independence. 55
The most highly publicized secession movements have occurred in
the Baltic states, and secessionist pressures have placed the future
of the Soviet Union in serious doubt. Article 72-guaranteeing a
right of secession-has been an important part of the debate. Until
recently, however, it provided no firm basis for secession, in part
because of the absence of a legal mechanism for its enforcement.5 6
Unilateral secession movements were said to violate Articles 73
and 74, which provide for the supremacy of Soviet law and for
Soviet sovereignty. 5
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">7 In April 1990</xref>
        , however, legislation was enacted
to provide for secession through a two-thirds majority in a
referendum and a five-year transition period.5
      </p>
      <p>The most vigorous secession movements have taken place in
Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia. The Soviet Union incorporated
these states by force in 1940, after they had enjoyed two decades of
independence. All three have seen vigorous secession movements.
The Estonian Congress has asked the United Nations and the
Soviet Parliament to restore "the free and independent republic of
Estonia."59 There was 78 percent support for independence among
Estonians." The Lithuanian Parliament unanimously approved a
formal declaration of independence." Over 90 percent of
Lithuanian citizens support independence.2 The Soviet Union responded
with a damaging economic blockade, 3 and also with military
force.64 Soviet troops captured the main publishing center in
Vilnius and also assaulted broadcasting stations, killing and
wounding unarmed civilians in the process6 5 Non-binding
plebiscites in Latvia showed 77 percent support for independence.6</p>
      <p>An important opposition movement in the Ukraine has asked
for complete independence from Moscow and the creation of an
independent Ukrainian state6. 7 The actual government of the
Ukraine has not gone so far, but it did proclaim itself a sovereign
state, one whose laws took precedence over those issuing from
Moscow and extended to the control of troops on Ukrainian
territory.68 Without issuing a formal statement of independence, the
Parliament of the Ukraine invoked the "supremacy, independence,
fullness and indivisibility of the republic's power on its territory
and its independence and equality in external relations. 6 9</p>
      <p>Arguments for eventual secession have been made in Soviet
Georgia as well.70 In March 1991, the citizens of Georgia voted
overwhelmingly (with 95 percent in favor) for independence,7 1 and
in April, the Parliament unanimously declared independence.72
The Soviet Parliament responded with a recommendation that
Gorbachev impose a state of emergency, 73 and troops have been
dispatched to stop internal fighting. 74 The Chuvash Autonomous
Republic has claimed sovereignty over its own natural resources;
the Mari Autonomous Republic has declared sovereignty; and
Russia itself has considered the possibility of secession.75 Buryatia has
proclaimed that its laws take precedence over those of the Soviet
Union. Moldavia has sought greater autonomy.7 6 Byelorussia has
declared its sovereignty as well.7 7</p>
      <p>Movements for secession in the Soviet Union promise to bring
about substantial changes in existing institutional arrangements.
President Gorbachev attempted to respond with a union plan 78
and an ambiguously worded referendum question. 79 Even if all 15
Soviet republics ultimately remain part of a federal union, it seems
certain that secessionist pressures will diminish the central
government's power over its subunits in major and potentially destructive
ways.80 In any case, these pressures have diverted energy and
attention from the effort to bring about democratic self-government
and economic prosperity in the wake of the downfall of the
previous system. This seems clear even if the grounds for secession are
in some or many cases substantial-a question I take up below.8 '</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>2. Precommitment and secession.</title>
      <p>For the moment I will not speak to the issue of whether and
when secession is desirable or just. Instead I want to ask whether a
Constitution ought to recognize a right to secede. I will understand
a constitutional right to secede as encompassing (a) an explicit
textual provision guaranteeing such a right or (b) an implicit
understanding that the constitution creates that right, accompanied in
either case by (c) a willingness to enforce that right by a court with
the power of judicial review-that is, a court capable of granting
and enforcing a subunit's request to secede despite the objections
of the central government. As the Soviet experience has shown in
the context of individual rights as well as the context of secession,
constitutional guarantees on paper often mean nothing without
institutions available to vindicate them.82</p>
      <p>At first *glance, the argument for a right to secede seems
straightforward. If a subunit no longer wants to exist within the
nation, why should it have to do so? This initial challenge draws
strength from a number of arguments, spelled out below, including
the need for local self-determination, the history of unjust
acquisition in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, the claims of ethnic and
cultural integrity, and the threat of abridgement of basic rights and
liberties.</p>
      <p>The issue of secession is, however, an unusually good
candidate for an analysis that stresses the use of constitutionalism as a
precommitment strategy. Indeed, the problem of secession closely
parallels the problems solved by the Full Faith and Credit Clause
and the Commerce Clause, and in some respects follows naturally
from those examples. The initial point is that constitutional
recognition of a right to secede might well have a range of harmful
consequences for democratic politics. In the face of such a right, a
threat to secede could under certain conditions be plausible at any
given time, allowing the exit of the subunit from the nation to be a
relevant factor in every important decision. It is not difficult to
imagine circumstances in which it will be in a subunit's interest to
issue that threat. Rather than working to achieve compromise, or
to solve common problems, subunits holding a right to secede
might well succumb to the temptation of self-dealing, and hold out
for whatever they can get.83 It is quite possible that some such
selfdealing has already occurred in Eastern Europe. 4</p>
      <p>A right to secede will encourage strategic behavior, that is,
efforts to seek benefits or diminish burdens by making threats that
are strategically useful and based on power over matters
technically unrelated to the particular question at issue. Subunits with
economic power might well be able to extract large gains in every
Union of Soviet SocialistRepublics 27-30, in Blaustein and Flanz, eds, 18 Constitutionsof
the World (cited in note 1).</p>
      <p>8 This was Lincoln's view:
If the minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government must cease.
If a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce, they make a precedent
which in turn will divide and ruin them; for a minority of their own will secede from
them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority.</p>

      <p>84 See, for example, Clines, UkrainiansDeclare Republic Sovereign (cited in note 68)
("(T]he declarations of sovereignty thus far are laying out a kind of negotiating agenda for
Mr. Gorbachev's promised attempt to redefine the union more favorably for the republics
decision involving the geographic distribution of benefits and
burdens. A constitutional system that recognizes and is prepared to
respect the right to secede will find its very existence at issue in
every case in which a subunit's interests are seriously at stake. In
practice, that threat could operate as a prohibition on any national
decision adverse to the subunit's interests.</p>
      <p>A temporarily disaffected subunit could, in short, raise the
stakes in ordinary political and economic decisions simply by
threatening to leave. The threat would be especially credible and
therefore disruptive if the subunit can or might prefer to exist on
its own. The recognition of a right of exit on the part of the
subunit could thus prevent fair dealing on the nation's part, by
allowing the subunit to veto policies that are justified on balance.</p>
      <p>It might also lead to undue caution. The threat to secede
might deter the government from taking action that offends a
subunit but is on balance justified. Consider, for example, the issue
of taxation. A tobacco-growing subunit equipped with the right to
secede might be able to veto a decision to raise taxes on (say)
cigarettes even if that decision would further the nation's long-term
interest. Similar considerations apply to the decision to enter into
war, to enact environmental regulation, or to increase or decrease
aid to agriculture. A secession right cannot plausibly be justified on
the ground that it is a necessary check on national policies
designed to ensure that those policies are in the general interest;
the fact that a state wants to secede is neither a necessary nor a
sufficient reason to believe that the general interest is being
violated.</p>
      <p>Family law supplies a helpful analogy. In a marriage, the
understanding that the unit is not divisible because of current
dissatisfaction, but only in extraordinary circumstances, can serve to
promote compromise, to encourage people to live together, to lower
the stakes during disagreements, and to prevent any particular
person from achieving an excessively strong bargaining position. A
decision to stigmatize divorce or to make it available only under
certain conditions-as virtually every state in the United States
has done-may lead to happier as well as more stable marriages,
by providing an incentive for spouses to adapt their behavior and
even their desires to promote long-term harmony8. 5 I intend to
85 See, for example, Jon Elster, Sour Grapes (Cambridge, 1983) (discussing adaptive
preferences). Family law also supplies a ready counter-argument: restrictions on divorce
may increase the power of the stronger party by denying exit to the weaker. It may also, by
adapting desires, produce one of the most pernicious forms of inequality, in which the
dismake no sweeping comment here on the structure of divorce law; I
argue only that in the secession context there are strong reasons
for making exit difficult.</p>
      <p>Recognition of a, right to secede would also ensure that any
subunit whose resources are at the moment indispensable, and that
might be able to exist on its own, is in an extraordinary position to
obtain benefits or to diminish burdens on matters formally
unrelated to its comparative advantage. Moreover, the shared
knowledge that the nation is terminable at the option of any subunit
would promote instability.</p>
      <p>In these circumstances, we might understand a waiver of the
right to secede as a solution to a collective action- problem or a
prisoners' dilemma. For each subunit, acting individually,
recognition of the right might increase its authority to obtain a large share
of the collective assets during any general allocation. But if the
right to secede exists, each subunit will be vulnerable to threats of
secession by the others. If the considerations marshalled thus far
are persuasive, all or most subunits are quite plausibly better off if
each of them waives its right to secede. More generally, the
difficulty or impossibility of exit from the nation will encourage
cooperation for the long term, providing an incentive to adapt conduct
and even preferences to that goal.</p>
      <p>Of course, the existence of a right to secede will have few such
consequences if a threat to secede is not credible. Under some
conditions, however, the threat will be a real one. Some subunits
might well find it in their economic interest to exist on their own.
If independence is economically preferable, the threat of secession
will be fully plausible. Other subunits will suffer some economic
loss if they secede, but still find independence worthwhile because
of gains in terms -of cultural or geographical autonomy or capacity
for self-governance. Here a threat of secession might be credible
even if the seceding subunit would be an economic loser.</p>
      <p>In the context of secession, the practical political problem goes
especially deep. The right to secede is different from other
potential vetoes on national legislative action precisely because it raises
fundamental and often emotional issues having to do with the
claims of ethnicity, territory, and history to separation and
selfdetermination. These issues have a peculiar tendency to inflame
both subunits and those who want them to remain part of the
nation. They tend to raise the emotional stakes in such a way as to
advantaged accept their fate because there is no alternative. There are undoubtedly
parallels here as well in the secession setting.
make the ordinary work of politics-not to mention day-to-day
interactions in other spheres-extremely hard to undertake. s6</p>
      <p>In Eastern Europe, divisions of this kind promise to be among
the most important questions for constitutional resolution in the
next generation."' Those divisions threaten not only to split
nations into subunits-which may or may not be good-but also to
paralyze national and local governments and to deflect them from
dealing with the enormous current social and economic problems.
Deliberation is often an inadequate check, and it comes at a high
price. A waiver of the right to secede protects against inflamed or
impulsive behavior."' On some occasions, the emotional stakes
should be raised in precisely this way. But constitutional
recognition of a right to secede accomplishes the relevant goals at great
risk to the fundamental task of creating healthy, long-term
constitutional structures.</p>
      <p>The large destabilizing effects of a right to secede may also
disrupt expectations whose existence is indispensable both to
economic prosperity and democratic self-determination. After
secession, it will be extremely hard to disentangle the contributions of
the subunit and the nation in order to decide who should be
paying whom for what. The sheer volume of the costs of allocation
provide at least a consideration against recognition of a right to
secede. Much more fundamentally, a nation whose subunits may
secede will be far less likely to engage in long-term planning.
Interdependence will be both threatening and risky, and thus will be
discouraged.</p>
      <p>86 It might be responded that the presence of a secession right may actually tend to
enable rather than disable politics; a subunit might be more inclined to accept impositions
by the central government as long as it is assured that when the impositions become
cumulatively intolerable it can leave. In a well-functioning democracy, however, there is no
problem with subunit "acceptance" of national decrees. Because the decrees are unlikely to be
punitive, and because the subunit will participate in forming them, acceptance by subunits
is generally forthcoming. A secession right is therefore unnecessary to promote acceptable
legislation.</p>
      <p>87 See Bohlen, East Europe's Past (cited in note 5); Gorbachev Explains Proposed
Union Pact to Party,NY Times All (Dec 11, 1990).</p>
      <p>8 These considerations point out the asymmetry between two seemingly parallel rights,
that of emigration and that of secession. The right to emigrate is an important check on
tyranny-as, plausibly, is the right to secede. But the right to emigrate does not create the
twin and related risks of strategic behavior and inflamed ethnic or cultural conflict. The
right to secede, unlike the right to emigrate, is exercised by subunits rather than
individuals, aggregates a number of citizens at once, and thus solves a collective action problem
faced by individual people who seek to emigrate. This solution to the collective action
problem poses the difficulties of strategic behavior and inflamed conflict.
The Universityof Chicago Law Review</p>
      <p>For Eastern European countries, it is imperative to develop
institutions that can ensure confidence in the long-term health of
the newly democratized governmental systems. Without such
institutions, the emerging market economies will fail. 9 A waiver of the
right to secede should be seen as part of a set of strategies
designed to bring about stable institutional arrangements. In this
light it should be unsurprising to observe proposed institutional
reforms designed to foster stability in the face of separatist appeals,
such as the Czechoslovakian plan to allocate much more power to
the republics and the "union treaty" proposal in the Soviet
Union.90</p>
      <p>There is an analogy here in the history of the American
Constitution. The Framers deemed it necessary to protect contractual
agreements against state impairment not to help creditors as a
class, but to ensure that commercial interactions would occur in
the first place." A system in which states can impair contracts will
discourage their formation in the first instance, and thus have
harmful long-term effects on the economy as a whole. So too, legal
protection of national unity should have an important coordinating
effect, creating expectations of long-term interaction indispensable
to national self-government.</p>
      <p>Thus far I have argued that a waiver of the right to secede is a
sensible precommitment strategy, one that is likely to remove a
serious threat to democratic processes. There are at least two
possible responses to this line of argument. The first is that if the
existence of the nation confers mutual benefits-an assumed
precondition for its continuation-then subunits will rarely threaten to
secede even if constitutionally authorized to do so, and the threat
will rarely be credible even if made. The costs of secession will
usually be at least as large for the subunit as for the nation. On this
view, recognition of a right to secede would never or rarely have
the adverse effects claimed for it. A well-functioning nation simply
will not face serious secession threats; subunits will invoke the
right only in the most extraordinary circumstances. Indeed, in
those circumstances the right is a necessary corrective to the status
quo.</p>

Federalist Papers280, 282-83 (cited in note 17).</p>
      <p>This rejoinder may be correct. Under certain circumstances,
recognition of a right to secede would probably make little
difference. But the rejoinder seems too optimistic. Sometimes secession
may well further the economic interest of the subunit, or the
threat might be credible because an economic loss would be
counteracted by gains in terms of symbolism or subunit autonomy.
Moreover, national politics affecting multiple subunits are subject
to unpredictable and often highly emotional factors. Technocratic
rationality does not characterize deliberations in which the specter
of secession is involved. The mere possibility of secession may
prevent calm negotiation.2</p>
      <p>There can be no assurance that secession will not be
threatened simply because things are generally going well and
there is mutual interdependence. Inflamed subunit sentiments
have been a characteristic feature of recent developments in
constitution-making, in Eastern Europe and elsewhere.93 And in
Eastern Europe in particular, social, economic, and environmental
problems-many demanding strong action from the central
government-have been quite severe, further fueling ethnic and
regional conflicts. In these circumstances a right to secede would be
especially dangerous.</p>
      <p>The second response would generalize the first, claiming that
the case against a constitutional right to secession is simply too
speculative. All of the harmful effects are possible, but there is no
good reason to think that they will occur. Perhaps a right to secede
is a necessary inducement to persuade subunits to enter the nation
at all. Perhaps subunits will rarely invoke the right to secede,
because social and political norms will deter them from doing so.
Perhaps the costs of secession to all subunits will be so high as to
make the threat implausible. The greater the degree of
interdependence and cohesion, of course, the higher the costs of secession.
Perhaps strategic behavior will be collectively punished, so that it
will occur rarely if at all. Perhaps the right to secede will be
in</p>

voked only in-cases in which it is an important safeguard.
      </p>
      <p>These suggestions are plausible. Under certain conditions, the
right to secession would have few deleterious effects, and it may
prevent serious harms. This is especially so in cases involving a
weak or loose confederation without substantial
interdependencies-the very concept now gaining popularity in Yugoslavia,
Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union. In such cases, the risks
posed by strategic behavior and inflamed ethnic and other passions
will be less severe. For the European Community, for example, a
right to secede may therefore be more sensible, and indeed it will
provide a greater incentive to join in the first instance.</p>
      <p>For those deciding on the contents of a constitution, the
questions are which scenarios are most likely and which provide the
worst case. The most that one can do here is to point to the often
large emotional attachments to subunits, the possibility of
financial gains from strategic behavior, the familiar frailties of human
nature, the rational and irrational factors that can make subunits
press secession claims, and the potentially debilitating effects of
such claims on subunit and national processes of self-government.</p>
      <p>In view of these considerations, it seems highly likely that
recognition of a constitutional right to secede would create serious
difficulties. In Eastern Europe, where strong nationalist passions
persist and threaten to infect daily politics if given an explicit
constitutional home, a right to secede would be especially damaging to
the prospects for democratic government. All this suggests a strong
presumption against a constitutional right to secede.</p>

      <title>II. REASONS FOR SECESSION</title>
      <p>Even if a constitutional right to secede would create risks for
democratic politics, the case against such a right has hardly been
completed. It might well be that the countervailing considerations,
justifying a right to secede, outweigh any such adverse effects.</p>
      <p>To explore this question, it will be useful to examine why a
subunit of a country might want to secede. The reasons fall into
five basic categories. All of them have played a prominent role in
discussions of this subject in Eastern Europe. Thus, for example,
infringement of civil liberties has played a role in Yugoslavia,
where the fear of Serbian oppression partly motivates Slovenian
and Croatian secessionism, and in the Ukraine, where Soviet
suppression of the Ukrainian Church has played a similar role.
Economic self-interest has been a motivating factor in the wealthier
republics of Yugoslavia and also in the Soviet Union.9 4 Economic
exploitation has been relevant in the Ukraine9. 5 The injustice of
the original acquisition is of special importance in Lithuania,
Estonia, and Latvia. Claims of cultural and ethnic integrity have played
a role in the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and the Czech and Slovak
Federative Republic."</p>
      <p>Many of these arguments provide plausible grounds for
secession as a matter of political morality.97 I evaluate them briefly
here, with special attention to their relationship to a claimed
constitutional right to secede.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>Abridgement of Civil Rights or Civil Liberties</title>
      <p>A subunit might want to secede because its people are being
oppressed, according to (let us assume) traditional liberal
understandings of oppression. In the Soviet Union, for example, the
'" See Clines, Byelorussia Joins Sovereignty Move (cited in note 77).
"5 See Clines, UkrainiansDeclare Republic Sovereign (cited in note 68).</p>
      <p>" See UkrainiansRally Against Moscow, NY Times A10 (Oct 1, 1990); Sudetic, Ethnic
Rivalries (cited in note 93); Pellar, Czechs Fearfor Federation(cited in note 54).</p>
      <p>17 For an especially helpful discussion, overlapping with the argument here, see Allen
Buchanan, Toward a Theory of Secession, 101 Ethics 322 (1991). The credibility of the
moral case makes it especially troublesome to suggest that military force should be used to
stop secession-a difficult problem that I cannot discuss in detail here. Sometimes military
force will be justified because the ground for secession is itself weak or involves oppression,
as in the case of the American Civil War. Sometimes such force will deter other secession
movements, and this will justify force when the secession movements are not, all things
considered, legitimate ones. But the consequences of the use of military force are generally
unpredictable and often worse than first anticipated. In this light the question whether a
nation should be kept together through official violence cannot be sensibly answered in the
abstract. At any rate, one need not and should not extrapolate from the American
experience the proposition that civil war is always preferable to secession.</p>
      <p>11 By traditional liberal understandings, I mean to include rights to freedom of speech,
freedom of religion, freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures, private property, and
the rule of law. See Stephen Holmes, Benjamin Constant and the Making of Modern
Liberalism 131-38 (Yale, 1984). I do not discuss here the more particular view that secession is
necessary to prevent (what some consider to be) abuses of government in the form of
redistribution of resources, social and economic regulation, and taxation methods that are
characteristic of western industrialized democracies. This view, associated with the ideas about
the state set out in different forms in Robert Nozick, Anarchy, State, and Utopia (Basic,
1974), and Richard A. Epstein, Takings (Harvard, 1985), might on certain assumptions
argue powerfully in favor of a secession right as a means of disabling government. If one wants
to disable government in this broad way, a secession right might be more easily
justified-though even here alternative mechanisms might be preferable, and the cure might be
worse than the disease.</p>
      <p>Note also that a right to secede might be sought, not to disable modern government,
but to establish a territorial right vindicated by history, or to ensure self-government by
ethnic or other groups. See also Part II.B. (arguing that economic self-interest of a subunit
is not a sufficient reason for a right to secede).
history of widespread abridgement of free speech, of political
liberty as a whole, and of basic guarantees of individual independence
an security might well have supported a claim to secede, certainly
before the increasing freedom encouraged by the Gorbachev regime
in the late 1980s.</p>
      <p>Governmental oppression of this sort might be limited to a
subunit, or it might be part of a general pattern of governmental
abuse. For example, the government may have limited the right to
freedom of speech in only one part of the nation. Alternatively, the
oppression might be quite general, and the subunit might want to
secede because it sees itself as subject, like other subunits, to an
intolerable regime.</p>
      <p>In this latter case, something other than the fact of oppression
must also be at work in order to justify secession as distinct from,
say, civil disobedience or revolution. If the oppression is general,
some independent factor-like cultural homogeneity or a claim to
territorial integrity based on history-is necessary to unite one of
the many subunits that are, by hypothesis, being oppressed. For
this reason, I focus here on the case of a subunit that is singled out
for injustice, in the form of abridgement of civil liberties or civil
rights.</p>
      <p>When oppression is pervasive, and not otherwise remediable,
secession is a justified response; it is fully plausible to say that a
subunit is entitled to leave a nation that is oppressing it. Standing
alone, however, injustice or oppression does not provide a powerful
case for creating a constitutional right to secede. If the central
government suspends civil rights and civil liberties, the preferable
response is to restore rights and liberties through the pressure of
domestic or international law. A selective abridgement of the right of
free speech is far more naturally countered by a restoration of that
right than by permitting exit from the nation. Abridgement of civil
rights or civil liberties appears to provide no good argument for a
constitutional right to secede, but instead furnishes reasons for a
constitutional order that makes abridgement unlikely.</p>
      <p>If restoration is for some reason impossible, of course,
secession might be necessary. In Eastern European nations without a
recent history of protection of civil rights and civil liberties, such
novel institutions as checks and balances and judicial review may
take a long time to develop, and provide weak safeguards,
especially at first.99 In such cases a constitutional right to secede could

fourteen years after the enactment of the written Constitution. Marbury v Madison, 5 US
137 (1803).
be understood as an indirect, second-best means of reducing the
risk of oppression. The oppression is not by itself a sufficient
ground for secession, but the secession right is necessary to
forestall it, buttressing the other constitutional safeguards. A possible
preliminary conclusion, then, is that the risk that a central
government will abridge the liberties of members of a subunit, or a
history of such abridgement, combined with the infeasibility of
eliminating the oppression, can justify both secession as a matter of
political morality and the creation of a right to secede.</p>
      <p>The implications for constitutional practice are twofold. The
first and most obvious is that constitutional systems should
contain powerful safeguards against the abridgement of civil rights
and civil liberties. The most important such safeguards are checks
and balances, federalism, a specification of protected rights, and
judicial review. If the constitution establishes these safeguards and
the central government observes them, this ground for secession
will disappear altogether. This is admittedly a large task in
Eastern Europe, but it is far more likely than a secession right to
produce sound long-term results.</p>
      <p>The second and more complex implication is that a
constitutional right to secede may be necessary to deter the abridgement of
civil rights and civil liberties. This argument has foundations in
the work of Thomas Jefferson, who favored both small political
units and occasional therapeutic rebellions-views that led him to
endorse a right to secede. Thus Jefferson wrote in 1816, "If any
State in the Union will declare that it prefers separation ... to a
continuance in union . . . I have no hesitation in saying, 'let us
separate.' "100</p>
      <p>We can find a parallel to this argument in the continuing
debates over federalism and rights of interstate mobility. Any society
that constitutes its government through a federal system-one that
embodies a decision to allow for movement among states and to
limit the scope of national law-necessarily creates a built-in
safeguard against political or economic oppression. A government that
oppresses its citizenry will soon find itself without citizens at all. In
Eastern Europe, for example, the existence of national controls
that could not be escaped through rights of exit served as an
extremely powerful check against change. The denial of the right to
travel was therefore the denial of a crucial political right, one that
'oo Thomas Jefferson, Letter to W. Crawford (June 20, 1816), quoted in Lee C.
Buchheit, Secession: The Legitimacy of Self-Determination109 (Yale, 1978).
belongs on the same plane as voting.10' The recent history of
Germany powerfully illustrates this proposition.</p>
      <p>In a healthy federal system, states will often compete to
attract citizens by offering better services. The result should be a
beneficial "race" to provide a mix of laws and regulations that
maximize liberty and security. Indeed, the fact of interstate
mobility in the United States is probably a far more powerful check
against many forms of state tyranny than the existence of judicial
review. Of course, there is a dark side to this process. The "race"
can be harmful as well as beneficial. Consider cases in which states
compete for revenue-providing industry by eliminating
environmental or occupational regulation that would in fact be optimal;
here the competition is destructive, and the national government
accordingly must be authorized to impose uniform regulation on its
subunits. But there can be no doubt that the right of exit operates
as a powerful check on tyranny of various sorts. It might follow
that a right to secede could be justified as a similar and quite
valuable mechanism for ensuring against oppression by the national
government. The fact that the method is indirect does not mean
that it is not extremely effective.</p>
      <p>In some contexts, a right to secede.might well be justified on
this ground. Especially when it seems clear that other institutions
cannot protect civil rights and civil liberties, a secession right
might be justifiable. But in general, it is doubtful whether the
argument overcomes the considerations against a constitutional right
traced in Part I. I have noted that there are far more direct and
less dangerous means of protecting against the abridgement of civil
rights and civil liberties. A good constitution will contain those
means. Rights of interstate mobility and a federal structure will
operate as additional safeguards.</p>
      <p>At least most of the time, a constitutional right to secede
would create severe risks without at the same time conferring
benefits that cannot be largely or entirely achieved through other
strategies. In Eastern Europe in particular, secession movements
have arisen at a time when the abridgement of civil rights and
liberties has been dramatically decreased, a point that suggests that
'0 See, for example, Shapiro v Thompson, 394 US 618 (1969) (holding unconstitutional
a state statutory provision denying welfare to residents who have not resided in the
jurisdiction for at least one year on grounds that personal liberty includes freedom to travel
throughout country without unreasonable burdens or restrictions); Kramer v Union Free
School District,395 US 621 (1969) (invalidating state statute limiting right to vote in school
district elections to those who own or lease taxable real property in the district or who are
parents of children enrolled in the schools).
the secession right is usually not founded on this form of
oppression at all. Secession was not a feasible option in Eastern Europe
as long as central governments consistently denied civil rights and
liberties. For this reason, an attempted justification of a secession
right based on those grounds seems unpersuasive.</p>
      <p>A subunit might want to secede because economic self-interest
suggests it ought to proceed on its own. The subunit may be
subsidizing other people of the nation in various ways; for example, it
may have valuable natural resources that are being used by
outsiders at costs lower than the subunit would like to charge, or its
members may be especially productive. Members of the subunit
might come to believe that they will be financially better off if they
create their own country.</p>
      <p>In Eastern Europe, this sort of argument appears to have
played at least some role in recent discussions. In Yugoslavia, the
comparatively rich and developed northern republics of Slovenia
and Croatia have sought to secede. Many Slovaks appear to fear
that the Czechs will take a disproportionate share of the benefits of
western investment, and that the government of President Havel
will not protect Slovakian economic interests.</p>
      <p>Whether or not economic self-interest justifies secession as a
matter of political morality is a complex question. The answer will
turn, at least in part, on whether there is a justification for the
economic harms faced by the subunit. This judgment will depend
in turn on theories about what the state may do. For example,
some appealing to the rule of the state attempt to justify
redistribution from rich subunits to poor ones. If such redistribution is
indeed justified, then the fact that the economic self-interest of the
rich subunit has been jeopardized is not a good basis for secession.</p>
      <p>Regardless of one's view of the propriety of redistribution,
however, the fact that secession might further a subunit's economic
self-interest provides insufficient reason to create a right to secede.
At any given time a subunit may be contributing more than what
seems its fair share, and perhaps some subunits will be doing so for
very long periods. But unless there is some kind of injustice, the
mere fact that secession is in a subunit's self-interest does not
justify creation of that right. Self-interest is usually a controversial
grounds for political action at the individual level, unless
translated into terms that invoke reasons other than self-interest alone;
it is all the more difficult to support secession of subunits on this
ground.</p>
      <p>HeinOnline -- 58 U. Chi. L. Rev. 659 1991</p>
      <p>This is especially so in light of the fact that to allow
self-interest to be a justification would produce a range of risks, canvassed
above, to the successful operation of the polity. Economic
self-interest is an especially weak basis for creating a constitutional right
to secede in light of the multiple deleterious effects that such a
right would have for the process of national self-government, which
may well be in the long-term interest of all subunits of the country.
A precommitment strategy is therefore appropriate.</p>
      <p>A more serious argument for a right to secession would stress
economic exploitation. By this term I mean not that a subunit is
simply losing, but that it can claim, with reasons, that the central
government is treating it unfairly. We might hypothesize that the
nation is systematically depleting the subunit's resources for the
general good, thus reducing the subunit's wealth far below what it
would be if the subunit stood alone; or the nation might be
unfairly discriminating against the subunit in the distribution of
general benefits and burdens. A claim for secession might well be
based on this sort of behavior from the nation's center. Indeed, a
right to secede-as in the case of abridgement of civil liberties and
civil rights-might be justified as a means of deterring economic
exploitation of subunits. In Yugoslavia, this idea has played an
important role. Slovenia and Croatia are economically advantaged,
and they fear that they will have to submit to a Serbian-controlled
national government, which they will have to subsidize.</p>
      <p>In some cases, economic exploitation might indeed justify
secession as a matter of political morality. But does the prospect of
exploitation argue for a constitutional right to secede? There are
several possible answers here. The first is that it is hard to define
the baseline against which to measure a claim of exploitation; the
term itself is a placeholder for ideas that must be substantively
defended. No subunit has an antecedent right to a stream of
welfare identical to what it would have received if it had not been a
member of the nation. Moreover, it is extraordinarily difficult to
calculate benefits and burdens, especially over long periods of time.
In many cases the 'question of exploitation will be hard to assess in
light of the many links by which subunits in a nation become
economically interdependent.</p>
      <p>Suppose that in some cases we might agree that a subunit is
being exploited by the nation. In such cases, a good constitution
will provide both structural and rights-based provisions designed
to prevent discrimination against certain subunits, and these
pro</p>
      <p>HeinOnline -- 58 U. Chi. L. Rev. 660 1991
1991]
visions will make a right to secede unnecessary. The subunit
should, for example, be granted full representation in the
legislature; this is a built-in, if partial, corrective. (It is only partial
because other parts of the nation may unite against the
subunit-hardly an unfamiliar phenomenon.) The United States
Constitution achieves this goal in part through the establishment
of a bicameral legislature in which all states, regardless of size,
have equal representation in one house. This requirement is, in
fact, the only element of the Constitution specifically protected by
the document itself against amendment without the consent of the
affected state.102 The constitution could also ban discriminatory
taxation, or require unanimous consent to certain measures raising
a risk of exploitation.</p>
      <p>These strategies pose dangers as well. Perhaps discriminatory
taxation is justified as a redistributive strategy or as a means of
taking account of differences in initial endowments. Perhaps
discriminatory taxation is a reasonable response to the nature of the
object of the tax. Suppose, for example, that a nation decides, out
of concern for the environment and the public health, to limit
through taxation the growing of tobacco or the mining of
high-sulfur coal. Those regions that produce the relevant commodities will
bear the brunt of the tax, but this disparate impact does not
necessarily make the tax bad or secession justifiable. Moreover, a
unanimity or supermajority requirement may forestall desirable
national action. In this sense such a requirement poses some of the
risks of a secession right. But the basic point is that a right to
secede is a second-best and highly indirect remedy, one that
creates a range of problems independent of economic exploitation and
whose purposes might be accomplished through other means.</p>

      <p>Secession might be sought by a subunit that claims that its
membership in the nation originally resulted from unjustified
aggression, and that sees itself as having territorial integrity as a
matter of history and international law, properly construed. Often
some understanding of this kind plays a role in secession claims.

sion. The subunit now seeks to separate from the nation as a way
of undoing an historical wrong.</p>
      <p>In Eastern Europe, of course, ideas of this sort have surfaced
prominently and provided an important impetus for secession
movements, especially in the Baltic states. Formerly independent
Lithuania was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940
as a result of the Nazi-Soviet Pact, and the incorporation was
clearly unlawful. Latvia and Estonia claim, plausibly, that they too
were forcibly and illegally incorporated as a result of the same
agreement. For these states, the Soviets are an occupying power,
and their inclusion in the union resulted from duress in the form
of a threatened Soviet attack.</p>
      <p>Arguments of this kind may well provide a sufficient moral
reason for secession. Certainly if little time has passed since the
original aggression, a right to secede seems self-evident; it corrects
the original injustice. But for three reasons, it is doubtful whether
the existence of historic abuses is a sufficient reason to create a
constitutional right to secede.</p>
      <p>The first is that a well-functioning system of international law
is the best, most direct way to prevent and to respond to
aggression.1 3- A right to secede is too general, applying in cases when
there has not been aggression at all. At most the phenomenon of
aggression justifies a moral right to secede in some narrowly
defined class of cases in which membership in the nation was
originally involuntary. Something like that right already exists as a
matter of international law.10 4 A generalized constitutional right to
secession is unnecessary to recognize a right to exit from a union
created by force.</p>
      <p>The second problem is a practical one. A nation that takes
other countries by force, and incorporates them, is unlikely to
re103 The Iraqi annexation of Kuwait is a recent example, though here it was necessary to
resort to force to bring about compliance with principles of international law.</p>
      <p>104This is the ambiguous and controversial right of self-determination. See Buchheit,
Secession: The Legitimacy of Self-Determinationat 8-20 (cited in note 100). The principle
of self-determination, recognized in the United Nations Charter and in numerous U.N.
Declarations, came to have great importance in the era of decolonization, though the contours of
the right-particularly with respect to armed intervention by third parties intent on
furthering the right-remain unclear. See also United Nations Declaration on Principles of
International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in
Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, which proclaims "The principle of equal
rights and self-determination of peoples" ("[A]ll peoples have the right freely to determine,
without external interference, their political status . . . and every State has the duty to
respect this right in accordance with the provisions of the Charter.") UN Res 2625 (Oct 24,
1970), in Dusan J. Djonovich, ed, 13 United Nations Resolutions,Series I

spect any right to secede that it has formally recognized. The
Soviet Union is at least a partial example." 5 In the event of
incorporation by force, a right to secede is especially prone to becoming an
ineffectual "parchment barrier."' 06</p>
      <p>The third problem is that the drigins of many, perhaps most,
nations often involve aggression and abuse at some point in the
past, and it is not easy to decide which such abuses provide a
sufficient basis for a right to secede. The category of cases in which
secession can plausibly be justified on such grounds is simply
enormous, and if secession is generally to be permitted, the result
would be an intolerable disruption of established arrangements.
This consideration suggests that while the injustice of the original
acquisition will often provide a good basis for a secession right, a
system that would allow secession in all such circumstances would
be hard to defend. 0 7</p>
      <p>In cases of subunits absorbed through aggression, then, the
preferable remedy is a system of international law, including an
internationally recognized right to restore original borders when
sufficiently little time has passed and when exercise of that right
would not unduly disrupt existing arrangements. 10 8 Sometimes a
right to secede is in fact justified on this ground as a matter of
political morality, and this factor argues in favor of some secession
movements now occurring in Eastern Europe, especially in the
Baltic states. But a domestic constitutional provision guaranteeing the
right to secede is both too small and too large a way to deal with
this problem.</p>

      <p>107For purposes of law and morality, it is both necessary and difficult to make temporal
and other distinctions. Subunits initially absorbed by aggression or other unjust means
often become well-integrated into a union over time and come to enjoy many benefits from
membership in the union. (Hawaii is an example.) At least when a good deal of time has
passed, it is hardly clear that injustices of several generations past by themselves justify
secession.</p>
      <p>
        10 The phrasing here is deliberately vague. A detailed discussion of when subunits once
annexed through aggression have a good moral justification for secession would take me far
beyond the current discussion. For a valuable discussion of the crucial territorial dimension

    <sec id="sec-11">
      <title>Cultural Integrity and Self-determination</title>
      <p>Often a claimed right to secede is built on an understanding
that the subunit has a cultural integrity that entitles it to
self-determination. The subunit perceives itself as both homogeneous and
-substantially different in terms of basic norms and commitments.
The very fact that it is governed by a broader entity appears to be
a form of tyranny, or an unjustifiable absorption by foreigners.
Rule by outsiders eviscerates the subunit's distinct identity.</p>
      <p>Ideas of this sort have frequently fueled secession movements
in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. Slovakia, for example, is more
agricultural and devoutly Roman Catholic than is the Czech
Republic, and the cultural difference certainly plays a role in the
secession movement. Often a claim to cultural integrity is
accompanied by a perception that the subunit had territorial integrity in
the past, and was the object of unjustifiable aggression. As a
practical matter, the two arguments tend to go hand in hand.</p>
      <p>'Whether a claim to cultural integrity justifies secession as a
matter of political morality is a complex matter. Certainly ethnic
homogeneity can make rule by outsiders impossible or oppressive.
Just as certainly, productive interactions among heterogeneous
groups can make for an especially successful democracy. History
offers examples of both phenomena. It is therefore impossible to
say, in the abstract, whether secession can be justified on this
ground. Much will depend on how culturally homogenous groups
are treated by the larger nation, the nature of the differences
between the subunit and the nation, and the forms their hornogeneity
takes. For example, a cultural group that oppresses others in its
region can hardly make a powerful mbral claim for a right to
selfgovernance if the larger nation prizes civil liberties. 10 9</p>
      <p>Here, as before, any legitimate claims that underlie a right to
secession might be accommodated by narrower and less dangerous
strategies-in particular, federalism and representation
mechanisms. A system of federalism often guards against precisely the
problem of rule by remote leaders having insufficient identification
with or knowledge of subunits. In the Amdrican experience,
federalism was designed to ensure local self-determination while at the
same time providing and thus benefiting from governance at the
national level. Federal systems can allow a large degree of
govern109 The attempt at secession by the American South is an example. In such a case,
secession would be unjustified even as a matter of political morality. A desire to oppress all
or part of the citizenry is not a good basis for secession. The American Civil War was of
course fought partly over these grounds.
ance by subunits claiming cultural and territorial integrity. Indeed,
the national constitution may restrict the central government to
certain enumerated powers, including provision of national defense
or regulation of interstate commerce,10° or it may expressly reserve
certain powers of internal self-governance to the subunits. It may
well be that through these routes, federal systems can
accommodate many of the concerns that underlie claims to secession based
on cultural integrity.</p>
      <p>Systems of representation might also supply a corrective here.
Seats in the national legislature might be set aside for subunit
representatives, to ensure that the views of subunits are expressed on
an ongoing basis during the deliberative process. Such seats might
provide a form of proportional or even super-proportional
representation. Perhaps a minority veto should be ensured on certain
issues.</p>
      <p>In some circumstances, however, these solutions will be
inadequate. Sometimes nationhood demands interference with local
selfdetermination, as in regulation of intrastate commerce having
interstate effects. Sometimes the claim for self-determination is
largely an emotional one, coming from a group affronted by the
very fact of national incorporation and national rule. Sometimes
nationhood involves an inevitable surrender of components of
sovereignty claimed by subunits. If full self-determination is the goal,
the only remedy will be secession, enabling the subunit to escape
entirely from the legal authority of the nation.</p>
      <p>It may be that this argument is sufficient, as a matter of
political morality, to justify secession in some contexts. It is surely
strengthened if the argument from cultural integrity is
accompanied by a claim to territorial integrity in the past. But it is
doubtful that, standing alone, the argument from cultural integrity
justifies a constitutional right to secede. In such cases, we are often
dealing, by hypothesis, with subunits that voluntarily agreed to
enter the nation at some earlier time."' In such cases, the claim of
cultural integrity will frequently be inadequate, because sufficient
commonalities with the nation will likely exist, justifying the
original agreement. Whether or not this is so, recognition of a right to
secede, based on grounds of cultural integrity, will probably pose
110This is, of course, the strategy followed by the United States Constitution. See US
Const, Art I.</p>

Baltic states, then it is not simply based on cultural integrity and should be analyzed as in
Part II.D.
dangers to national self-determination that are not
counterbalanced by the advantages to the various subunits themselves.
Whether or not the interest in cultural integrity provides a good
moral justification for secession, it does not support a decision to
place a right to secede in a founding document.</p>
      <p>Indeed, cultural integrity is a particularly weak reason to
constitutionalize the right to secede insofar as it is precisely the
cultural integrity of subunits that most dramatically threatens
processes 'of national self-determination. In the most extreme
cases, revolution or a negotiated settlement may be justified. But
constitutional recognition of a right to secede would be a cure
worse than the disease.</p>
      <p>The right to revolt differs in interesting ways from the right to
secede. It would be plausible to constitutionalize the former right
as, in a sense, the United States Constitution has done through the
right of amendment," 2 which in theory could be used by Congress
and the states to rewrite the founding document in fundamental
ways. But since the point of a revolution is to reject the established
order, it is unclear why constitutionalization of any such right
would be a useful step at all. If the argument above is persuasive,
however, it is even less plausible to constitutionalize the right to
secede. The latter right is usually defined in the discrete terms of
some subunit-geographical, ethnic, or religious, or some
combination of these-and these features of the relevant right pose the
distinctive risks of strategic bargaining or an inflamed polity. A right
of revolution does not create these risks in an even vaguely similar
fashion.</p>
      <p>Nor does a negotiated settlement pose the difficulties involved
in a right to secede. The whole point of such a right is that there is
no need for the approval of others in order for the right to be
exercised. A negotiated settlement can be brought about without a
constitutionalized secession right.113</p>

      <title>III. A QUALIFIED RIGHT TO SECEDE?</title>
      <p>A possible response to the discussion thus far would be that
the right-to secede should indeed be constitutionalized, but hedged
with qualifications and limitations that minimize the risk of
strategic behavior. At least four possibilities seem plausible. One
strat112 US Const, Art V.</p>
      <p>113 Such a settlement might of course be blocked with a constitutional prohibition

be beneficial.
egy would allow secession if and only if a large majority of the
subunit sought it. Another would allow secession only under
certain enumerated circumstances, as, for example, in cases of
suspension of civil liberties or economic exploitation. Yet another would
create a requirement of prolonged deliberation before secession
would be lawful. Such a system might involve, for example,
multiple popular votes, with substantial waiting periods between
votes.114 A fourth approach would create a right to secede, either
absolute or qualified, but make it nonjusticiable. Each of these
possibilities raises difficult and general questions about
constitutionalism. I deal with them only briefly here.</p>
      <p>All of these routes have large advantages over an unqualified
right to secede, but it is doubtful whether the advantages justify
constitutionalization of even a qualified right to secede. A
requirement of a supermajority would certainly limit the occasions for,
and seriousness of, secession threats. But in cases in which the
subunit can be energized-for reasons of economic self-interest or
ethnic and territorial self-identification-the protection would be
inadequate. It is true that a subunit may want to secede for good
reasons, but as discussed above, there are better and less
disruptive means of ensuring that the good motivations that sometimes
underlie secession movements can be addressed. These involve,
above all, federalism, checks and balances, entrenchment of civil
rights and civil liberties, and judicial review. If these protections
are inadequate, it is highly doubtful that a qualified right to secede
will do the job.</p>
      <p>There is something to be said in favor of a secession provision
that would be limited to specified causes. Such a provision might
be treated as ancillary to the nondiscrimination principles and
basic protections of liberties. It would furnish a powerful and
selfenforcing mechanism against violations of the relevant rights. But
to accomplish these purposes, the right to secede is probably too
blunt and dangerous an instrument. One might hope that the
direct provisions discussed above will be sufficient. More
fundamentally, the recognition on paper of a right to secede is unlikely to be
a useful supplement if they are not. A state that violates its textual
114 The State of New York has created such a process for dealing with the secessionist
demands of Staten Island, a subunit of the City of New York that may prefer to become an
independent municipality. Staten Island residents must first approve secession in two
referenda, with a period for hearings between the two votes; the state legislature would then have
to pass legislation approving the secession. See City of New York v State of New York, 557
NYS2d 914, 158 AD2d 169 (1990) (rejecting equal protection challenge to this scheme).
commitments to civil rights and liberties will probably not respect
its textual commitment to secession.</p>
      <p>A right to secede after an extended period of deliberation
would probably be the best of the various alternatives. Through
this route it would be possible to reduce some of the risks of an
inflamed polity. Indeed, the very difficulty of obtaining secession
would deter efforts to seek that remedy unless it seemed necessary,
and would diminish the possibility that any threat of secession
could disrupt democratic and deliberative processes. For this
reason it could not be said, a priori, that such a system would
necessarily be undesirable. But in Eastern European nations with a
history of ethnic and religious tensions, even a secession right
modified in this way would pose significant risks to
self-governance. A prolonged deliberative period over the question of
continued ties to the nation could create all of the threats emphasized
above. Probably the best result is not to create the right at all.</p>
      <p>A final possibility would be to create a right to secede but to
make it nonjusticiable-that is, to make the right one that courts
will not recognize or enforce. India's Constitution follows this
strategy mainly with respect to certain "positive" rights, including
the right to subsistence. 115 Such rights are recognized in the sense
that the constitution makes them binding on the legislature, but
the courts are unable to protect them. The argument for
entrenched but nonenforceable rights is that their entrenchment
establishes norms that government is morally and politically obliged
to respect, but whose judicial enforcement would create, in
especially severe forms, the various difficulties produced when judges
lacking policymaking competence or a good electoral pedigree are
responsible for the vindication of constitutional rights. 116 The right
to subsistence is a plausible candidate for this strategy because of
"' Part IV of the Indian Constitution includes "Directive Principles of State Policy,"
which are nonjusticiable. See Art 37: "The provisions contained in this Part shall not be
enforceable by any court, but the principles therein laid down are nevertheless fundamental
in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these
principles in making laws." These provisions include minimalization of inequalities in income and
elimination of inequalities in status, facilities, and opportunities (Art 38, cl 2); "equal pay
for equal work for both men and women" (Art 39(d)); free and compulsory elementary
education (Art 45); the securing of a "living wage" for all workers (Art 43). The right to
subsistence is most directly stated in Art 39, which provides: "The State shall, in particular, direct
its policy towards securing: (a) that the citizens, men and women equally, have the right to
an adequate means of livelihood. . . ." Constitution of India (1949), reprinted in Albert P.
Blaustein, et al, India 62-64, in Blaustein and Flanz, eds, 7 Constitutions of the Countries
of the World (cited in note 1).</p>

Constitutional Norms, 91 Harv L Rev 1212 (1978).
the vagueness of the right and, more fundamentally, the obvious
problems in its judicial definition and implementation. Perhaps
the right to secede should be placed in this category.</p>
      <p>The principal difficulty with this claim is that nonjusticiable
rights are usually those whose elaboration would strain judicial
capacities. Here there is no such problem. To make the right to
secession nonjusticiable would reflect not a problem of definition or
implementation, but instead ambivalence about the right itself. As
distinguished from the right to subsistence, there is nothing vague
about the right to secede. Moreover, as the recent experiences of
constitutionalism in Eastern Europe and China reveal, judicially
unenforceable constitutional rights are frequently not rights at all.
By itself this consideration makes it important to ensure that
constitutional rights are generally enforceable, lest the specification of
unenforceable rights lead, in a system unaccustomed to such rights
at all, to a process in which constitutional rights are generally not
subject to real-world vindication.</p>
      <p>If the case for a right to secede is persuasive, then the right
should be both entrenched in the text and judicially enforceable. If
the case is weak, then an unenforceable right is no better than no
right at all. In any case, the right to secede does not have the
characteristics that sometimes justify entrenched but unenforceable
rights.</p>
      <p>CONCLUSION</p>
      <p>Claims for recognition of a constitutional right to secede raise
large questions about the nature of constitutional protections in
the emerging Eastern European democracies. I have suggested that
constitutional protections should often be understood as an effort
to facilitate rather than merely to frustrate democratic processes.
Such efforts take many forms: the protection of rights central to
self-government; the creation of fixed and stable arrangements by
which people might order their affairs; the removal of especially
charged or intractable questions from the public agenda; the
creation of incentives for compromise, deliberation, and agreement;
and the solution of problems posed by collective action problems,
myopia, impulsiveness, and prisoners' dilemmas. Ideas of this sort
provide a helpful if partial foundation for considering possible
provisions in new constitutions. In any case, they suggest that a right
to secede does not belong in a founding document.</p>
      <p>In some cases, a right to secede will be fully justified as a
matter of political morality. Nothing I have said argues against the
view that subunits sometimes have good reasons for seceding. On
the contrary, I have attempted to catalog the reasons for secession
and in the process to show that those reasons are often powerful.
But the existence of occasionally powerful moral claims supplies
insufficient reason for constitutional recognition of the right to
secede. A nation that recognizes this right, and is prepared to respect
it,-may well find that it has thereby endangered ordinary
democratic processes. A decision to allow a right of exit from the nation
will divert attention from matters at hand, allow minority vetoes
on important issues, encourage strategic and myopic behavior, and
generally compromise the system of self-government. For this
reason, a waiver of the right to secede should be seen as a natural part
of constitutionalism, which frequently amounts to a
precommitment strategy directed against problems of precisely this sort.
People deciding on constitutional provisions often choose, in advance,
to waive seemingly important rights when the waiver would serve
the general interest.</p>
      <p>To say this is not, I emphasize, to deny that there are good
reasons why a subunit might want to secede. In Eastern Europe, it
is plausible to say that such reasons exist in several places. I have
suggested that even when this is so, there are generally -more direct
means of accomplishing the desired goals, such as local
self-determination through federalism, firm protection of civil rights and
civil liberties, and institutional and substantive guarantees against
economic exploitation. It may be that the more direct means are in
some circumstances inadequate. In such cases, however, the proper
remedy is to reach a negotiated solution, to exercise the unwritten
right to revolt, or to apply the pressure of domestic and
international law, rather than to create a constitutional right to secede.</p>
