ingsinwhichevidenceis givenis an ancientpartof the commonlaw. Sir EdwardCoke notedthatthe "word oath is derivedfromthe Saxon word eoth."The oath is nothingless,said Coke, than"an affirmatioonr deniall byanyChristianof anythin glawfulland honest,beforeone or more, thathave the authorityto givethe same foradvancementof truthand rightc,allingAlmightyGod to witness thathis testimon yis true" (1809, 165).1Yet thereis evidence thattheuse of oathsextendsback to Roman times,wherethe law of the TwelveTables providesthat"Whoevergivesfalseevidencemustbe thrownfromtheTarpeian rock" (Stephens1883,1: 11). And Cicero inDe Officiiasrguesthat"in taking an oath it is our dutyto consider notwhatwe mayhave to fearin case ofviolationbutwhereinitsobligationlies: an oath is an assurance backed byreligioussanctitya;nd a solemnpromisegiven,as before God as one's witness,is to be sacredlykept"(1991, III: 104,383). As Samuel Pufendorfemphasized,oaths werenot simplythepreserveof Christians: 
AnoaththeveryHeathenslook'd on as a thingofso greatforce, and ofso sacredauthorityt,hat theybelievedthesinofperjuryto be punishedwiththeseverestvengeance; suchas extendeditselfto theposterityof theoffendera,nd suchas mightbe incurr'dbythe bare thoughtand inclinationwithout theact.

Since you have alreadyheardso muchon the subjectof constitutionalstandardsforimpeachmentI, would liketo concentrateon three big mistakesthathave characterized the discussionup to now. 
thepowerof thisCommitteeand thepresentHouse of Representativesto send a case to trialin the Senate. People seem to be assuming thatonce thepresentCommittee and thefullHouse vote fora bill of impeachmentt,he stagewillbe set fora trialin theSenate duringthe comingyear,and thatthenext House willnothave to take anyfurtheractionson thematter. 
Nothingcould be furtherfromthe truthA.s a constitutionamlatter,the House of Representativesis not a continuingbody.When the 105th House dies on January3, all itsunfinishedbusinessdies withit.To beginwiththemostobviousexample, a bill passed bythe 105th House thatis stillpendingin the 105th Senate on January3rd cannotbe enacted intolaw unlessit once again meetsthe approvalof the 106t House. 
This is as it shouldbe. Otherwise lame-duckCongresseswould have a fielddayin situationslike the present,wherethe old House majorityhas had a setbackin thepolls. Recognizingthatitspoliticalpower is on thewane,the dominantparty continueodnpage 29

Removalfromofficet,hegrand and forbiddingconsequenceof successfulimpeachmentd,istinguishes thisprocessradicallyfromthe judgementof a court.It resembles rathera vote of no confidencein a legislatures,uchas theBritishparliament.By sucha vote theHouse of Commonscan bringto an end thelifeof a governmentI.n 1841, Sir RobertPeel summedup this fundamentaclonventionof theBritishConstitutionwhenhe successfullymovedthat"her Majesty'sMinistersdo not sufficientplyossess the confidenceof theHouse of Commonsto enable themto carry throughtheHouse measureswhich theydeem of essentialimportance to thepublicwelfare."

The discussionforthepast four years,and especiallyforthe past ten months,has notgottento this,the nexusof themostseriousissue.The discussionhas focusedupon attitudestowardthe personwho now occupiestheofficeof president,and, secondarilyu,pon whatpeople believeis theevidence.But themost seriousissue is differentT.here has been a continualavoidanceof the costsand benefitsof impeachment whenconsideredin relationto the wholepoliticalsystem.

Since "mankindmusttrustto one another"thereis no moreefficacious means thanthroughthe use of oaths: "Hence legal adjudications, grave,of necessityproceed and depend upon oaths."As a result,lying underoath is farmoreseriousthan merelylying;perjuryis,Paley notes, "a sinof greaterdeliberation,"an act that"violatesa superiorconfidence" (1: 193-197).

For Paley,theissue of oathsand justice(McCloskey1967,1: 310, 240, 325).

In Paley'sview,theentire questionof perjuryrestedon the definitionof a lie: "A lie is a breach of promise:forwhoeverseriously addresseshis discourseto another, "The courtsofjustice,in almostevtacitlypromisesto speak thetruth, eryage, and in almosteverycountry, because he knowsthatthetruthis have had recourseto oaths,or appeals to heaven,as themostuniver- expected."And theeffectosf lying sal and themostpowerfulmeansto engagemen to declarethetruthB.y thecommonlaw,beforethetestiare notsimplyprivate;theyare public in thedeepestand mostimportantsense: Wilsontookhis moraland histori- whichgovernand affecteveryright and intereston thisside of the completeand unreservedaccountof whathe knowsof the subjectof the trial,whetherthequestionsproposed to himreach theextentof his knowledgeor not" (1: 200-01).

Such a sense of shameor embarrassmentcannot"justifyhis concealmentof thetruthu,nlessit could be shown,thatthe law whichimposes theoath,intendedto allow thisindulgenceto suchmotives"(1: 201).

Willfuldeceitis the keyto whether a witnesscommitsperjuryor not, whateverthe meanschosen.5The moraland legal inheritanceof the foundinggenerationincludedthe beliefthattheviolationof an oath was nothingless than"treachery" (Sidney[1698] 1990,225). 
None of themajorwriterswith whomthefounderswereintimately conversantsaw perjuryas anything butone of themostseriousoffences againstthecommonwealth.I6n his widelycited Treatiseon thePleas of theCrown,forexample,William Hawkinsexplainedthattherewere certainkindsof offencesthatwere 26 "infamous,and grosslyscandalous, proceedingfromprinciplesof down rightdishonestym,aliceor faction"; and itwas underthisrubricthathe included"perjuryand subornation ofperjury."Indeed,he wentfurther arguingthat"perjury... is of all crimeswhatsoeverthemostinfamous and detestable"([1724-26] 1972,1: 
Perjur3y1w8a-s1,9i)n.7thefirstinstance, tiedto jurorswho mightgivea false verdictand "forseveralcenturiesno traceis to be foundof thepunishmentofwitnessesforperjury."And, even afterit originatedin the Star Chamber,itwas onlyby"slow degrees[that]theconclusionthatall perjuryin a judicialproceedingis a crimewas arrivedat" (Stephens 1883,3: 241, 247). In 1562-63there came thefirststatuteprovidingpenaltiesforthosewho committedboth perjuryand subornationofperjury (Holdsworth1966,4: 515-18).Thus werehumanpunishmentmsade to augmentthefearof divinevengeance forlyingunderoath.8This was, in Pufendorf'vsiew,absolutely essential,as he notedbyquoting Demosthenes:"Those who escape yourjustice,leave to thevengeance of thegods; but thoseon whomyou can layhands,neverconsignoverto Providencewithoutpunishingthem yourselves"(1717, IV. II. 2, 118). 
It was bythisjointpowerof the sacredand thesecularthatmen could put theirfaithin oathsas a

Based on theforegoinganalysis and reviewof thehistoricalrecord, theconclusionseems inescapable, based on theexpressedintentof the framerst,hewordingof the Constitution,thewritingosf theprincipal legal authoritiesknownto theframers,and thecommonlaw,thatperjurywouldcertainlybe includedas a "highCrimeand Misdemeanor"in an impeachmenttrialunderthe UnitedStatesConstitutionF. urther, therecordfailsto supporttheclaim thatimpeachableoffencesare limitedto onlythoseabuses thatoccur in theofficiaelxerciseof executive to the demandsof republicangovernmentis seen mostclearlyin how fewhave been theinstancesof its use. Lord Brycedescribedthepower of impeachmentovera centuryago as "theheaviestpiece of artilleryin thecongressionalarsenal"and thus "unfitforordinaryuse." The process seekingto removea president,he said, "is likea hundred-tongun whichneeds complexmachineryto bringit intoposition,an enormous chargeof powderto fireit,and a largemarkto aim at" (Bryce[1893] 1995,1: 190). The constitutional provisionsforimpeachmentwere intended,in part,to securethechief executivefrombeingdrivenfrom officeformerepartisanreasons.To power.As seen in theauthorities, impeachableoffencesi,n bothEnglishand Americanhistoryh, ave get ridof a president-orto tryto been understoodto extendto "per- Congresshas to have good cause.

importanceof oaths. For example,Justice Jacob Rush, the brotherof Benjamin Rush, expressedviewsmuch like those of Wilson in a pamphletpublishedin 1796, The Natureand Importanceofan Oath-theCharge to a Jury(Rutland, Vermont): "An oath is a veryserious transaction. . . the nature[of which]. . . is the solemn appeal to God-it is engagingto speak the truth,and calling upon Him to witnessour sincerityt,hatconstitutethe oath and obligation."Thus is it importantthatcivilsocietymaintaina due attentionto "the religioussentimentupon whichan oath is founded"; to allow that sentimentto relaxwill be "injuriousto society"(Hyneman and Lutz 1983, 2: 10151017, 1018).

wouldbe wellwithinhis rightsto quash thelame-duckimpeachment and remandthematterback to the House. 
Since the statusof lame-duckimpeachmentshas neverbeforebeen briefedand arguedin themodern era inauguratedbytheTwentieth Amendmenti,t is impossibleto make a firmguessas to thewaythe chiefjusticewillruleon thematter. Onlyone thingis clear.It wouldbe farbetterforthecountryand the constitutio nifthechiefjusticeis neverput to thistest.As Alexander Bickel,mygreatpredecessorin the SterlingChair at Yale, frequently remindedus, the healthofour constitutionaslystemis notmeasuredby thenumberof "hardcases" that have been resolvedbyclear rulings. It is measuredinsteadbythenumber of statesmenin our historywho, seeinga hardcase on thehorizon, act in sensiblewaysso as to avoid everprecipitatinga constitutional crisis. 
If thisCommitteeand thepresent House choose to go forwardand vote in favorof a bill of impeachment,I respectfulluyrgethenew Speaker of the 106thCongressto do the rightthing,and remitthematter once again forconsiderationbythe newHouse. Suppose,however,he does not do so; suppose furtherthat thechiefjustice,whenpressed,upholdsthecontinuingvalidityof the lame-duckimpeachmentdespitethe expirationof the 105th Congress. Even then,thenewHouse of Representativewsillnotbe able to escape the need foranotherup or downvote to determinewhethera majorityofmemberscontinueto favorimpeachment. 
To see why,considerthatthe House mustselecta groupof its members,called "impeachment managers,"to presentitscase againstthepresidentat theSenate trial.Withouttheenergeticprosecutionof thecase bythemanagers, theSenate trialcannotgo forward. No managers,no trial;butonlythe newHouse can appointthemanagers. Thiswas done in JudgeHastings'case, and it certainlyshouldbe requiredin thecase of a sitting 30 presidentfacinga lame-duckimpeachment. 
Thus,even ifthenew House leadershipchooses to relyon a lameduckimpeachmenta,nd refusesto allow anothervote on a freshbill beforesendingthematterto the Senate,thereis no wayit can avoid theneed to testthemajoritysentimentof the newHouse.

A secondmistakeinvolvesa persistentconfusionabout impeachment standards.People keep on talkingas ifthestandardsthatapplytojudges also applyto presidentsB.ut a glanceat theconstitutionatlextis enoughto establishthatthisis a mistake.UnderArticleIII of the Constitutiona,nyfederaljudge may be deprivedof his lifetimejob ifhe failsthetestof "good Behavior." Thus,the House and Senate may removea judge even ifhis "bad" behaviorwould nototherwise amountto a "highCrimeand Misdemeanor." 
In contrast,the Constitutiondoes not allow presidentsto be removed forwantof "good behavior"-forthe obviousreasonthathe does not serveforlife,but is underregular electoralscrutinybythepeople. Moreover,thereshouldbe no doubt thatthe Framerswere seriousin restrictintghemselvesto highcrimes and misdemeanorsI.n contrastto the impeachmentclause,othertextual referencesto crimedo not containsimilaremphasison highcrime. Thus,theExtraditionClause applies to anyonewho commits"Treason, Felonyor otherCrime,"and Article I, Section6 giveseverycongressman an immunityfromarrestexceptin cases of "Treason,Felony,and Breach of the Peace." This standsin sharpcontrastto thehighcrimes requiredof presidentsa,nd the mere breachesof good behaviorrequired in thecase ofjudges. It is a bad mistake,then,to assume thattherelativelylow impeachmentstandard applied to judges also applies to the president.The merefactthatthey are undoubtedlyremovableforperjurydoes not implythatthepresidentis also impeachableforthe same offense. 
Whichleads me to thethirdand lastmistake.Perhapsbecause of the role of thespecial prosecutorin this case, therehas been a constant temptationto imaginethatwhatwe are doinghere is considering whetheryou shouldissue something similarto a criminalindictment. This is a mistaketoday,even though therewas a timelongago whenthis viewwas plausible.When impeachmentbegan in the Englishparliamentfivehundredyearsago, this medievalassemblystillthoughtof itselfas a High Court,and often subjectedthevictimsof impeachmentto direcriminalpunishments. 
But theFramersof our Constitutionself-consciouslryejectedthese medievalprecedents.Theycarefully limitedthesanctionsforimpeachmentto removalfrompoliticaloffice,and thelike.Once a president departs,he is fullysubjectto the rigorsof criminalprosecution. 
Ratherthanstandingabove thelaw, 
runsa greaterriskof an indictment forperjuryin theyear2001 thanany otherAmericancitizenalive today. 
This committeedoes notsitas a grandjuryof theDistrictof Columbia, but as a grandinquestrepresentingthenation.It shouldnotfocus on the detailsof a particular crime,but ask itselfa verydifferent question:Does theconductalleged in thiscase constitutesuch a threat to theveryfoundationsof the Republicthatit is legitimateto deprive thepeople of theirfreelyelected choice as president? 
For twocenturies,theCongress has showngreatrestraintin dealing withthisquestion.Fromtheera of George Washingtonto thatof Ronald Reagan, presidentshave often stretchedtheirconstitutionaaluthorityto theverylimits,makingunpopular decisionswhichhave often provedto be in thelargerinterestof thenation.And yetonlyone President-AndrewJohnson-hasbeen impeached,and onlyone-Richard Nixon-has resignedunderthreatof impeachmentT.he presidentialconductinvolvedin bothcases amountedto an assaulton thevery foundationsof our democracyA.ndrewJohnsonsoughtto blockthe enactmentof theFourteenth Amendmenta,nd itsguaranteesof equal protectionand due processto all Americancitizens(Ackerman 1988,chap. 8). RichardNixon soughtto underminetheveryfoundationsof thetwo-partysystem. 
Once we lowerthe impeachment standardto includeconductthat does not amountto suchclear and dangerto our constitutionaolrder, we willdo grievousdamage to the independenceof thepresidency. 
JamesMadison saw this.At the [ConstitutionalC] onvention,he opposed the additionof anylanguage whichwouldwaterdownthesolemn requirementof a "highCrimeand Misdemeanor."A lowerstandard, he said,would transformthePresidencyfroman officewitha fixed four-yeartermto one "whoseterm willbe equivalentto a tenureduring thepleasureof the Senate" (Farrand 1996,550). Indeed,whenthe Foundersvotedon theimpeachment standard,theydid not,in fact,vote on theprovisionthatappears in the of PresidentAndrewJohnsonin texttoday.Instead,theyactuallyap- 1868.Thoughthisimpeachmentefproveda standardthatrequiredthe fortbarelyfailedto gain two-thirds proofof a "highcrimeand misde- supportin the Senate,it drained meanoragainstthestate"[emphasis effectivpeowerfromthepresidenadded].

The states,likewise,we maynote, experimentedin theoryand practice witha varietyofmethodsofbridgingthisgap.

The presidenthas a unique com34 binationof formaland informal powersthatrevolvearoundhiscentralityto theexecutivebranch,his role as theprimeleader in national securitypolicy,his leadershipof one of thepoliticalparties,and his twentieth-centurryole in legislativeleadership,[are] stronglyaffectedbyall hisotherpowers,butgroundedin hispossessionof theveto,which effectivelmyakeshimone-thirdof the legislativeprocess. 
The presidentdoes notprevailall thetimein thesedomains,or even in anyone of them.But thepresident'srole in severalof themis almostalwayscritical,and is so even now.1 
The normalrequirementofAmerican governmenetngagesall these resources,as presidentsworkwith, against,and arounda varietyof allies and opponents.If anypresident wereto be removed,no otherperson could exerciseequivalentleadershipuntilthesuccessorhad developed his own relationships. 
The level of cost to thesystem goes farbeyondthis.It is in the intenseanimositythatalmostsurely willhave developed. 
These seventeenth-centucrayses thatI mentionedearlierare not meredecoration,but have direct application.Lawyers,of course,use themto tracetheverymeaningof thelaw itself(U.S. House of Representatives1974). These historical cases help me to statea simplehypothesis:Whatevernewweapon is introducedintothepoliticalbattle tendssoon to become domesticated, evenbanalized,so thatitsuse is moreand morecommonjudgment. It willbe adapted and adopted by manyothergroups.JamesJ.Kilpatrickwas nottalkingabout impeachments,but about [having]... theSupremeCourthold the Paula Joneslaw suitout untiltheconclusion of thepresident'sterm.But his statement[that]thedecision"is likelyto encouragetrumped-upharassmentsof futurepresidentson downtheline" (1998, 46) is apposite. mentalcareerof Lionel Cranfield, also wrotethat"The resurrectionof (this) antiquated weapon . . . produced some fortyimpeachmentbsetween1621 and 1688" (1958, 248). That is sixty-seveynears(67) times twelvemonths(12) fora sumof eighthundredand fourmonths (804). Divided byforty(40), the numberof impeachmentst,he result is,on a straight-linaeverage,one impeachmenteverytwentymonths. In fact,of course,theseimpeachmentscame in clusters,ratherthan on a straight-linaeveragebasis. But theechoes fromseventeenth-century England,withitsfifteento twenty impeachmentdsuringa threeyear period,withnumerousimpeachmentson slenderevidence(Holdsworth1924,260), are notto [be] takenlightlyI.n the slow-moving seventeenthcenturyf,actions broughteach otherto thetestwhetherroutinelyoverlongperiods or moreintenselyin periodicbursts.

The maintenanceof thiskindof seriousnesswillbe increasinglyproblematic,in somewhatthe same way of maintaininga highlevelof dignity has alreadyprovedproblematic. 
House leadershiphas, presumably withall seriousness,urgeddignity. 
But sincethebeginningof 1998,everylevelof theinquiryhas become moreraucousthananyonein the leadershippredictedbefore.It will continueto go beyondcontrolunless thereis some clear decisionthat producesthecontraryA.lexander Hamiltonwas rightto sayin Federalist65 (423): "The prosecutionof [actionsdeemed impeachable]... willseldomfailto agitatethepassionsof thewhole communitya,nd to divideit intopartiesmoreor less friendlyor inimicalto the accused." That tellsus thatsuchmatters shouldbe approachedwithprudence and wisdom. 
The impeachmentprocesslends itselfto thepersistentconflictof factions.Each ofwhichwillseek to use theprocessto advance itsown materialgoods and itsown revered symbolst,o pursuevengeanceand feudas iftheywere Capulet and Montague.Case in point:On October 8, 1997,duringtheHouse debate on the resolutionto launchan impeachmentinquiryintotheconductof PresidentClinton,one man fromAlabama called the CNN conservativephone line to saythatwhat he enjoyedwas frustratioannd defeatin theeyesof theliberalswho had been havingit all theirway, havingbeen in powerfor40 years. 
Such a statementshouldbe seen as thecloud no biggerthana man's hand.Again,to citeHamilton:"In manycases itwillconnectitselfwith thepre-existinfgactions,and will enlistall theiranimositiesp,artialities,influencea,nd intereston one side or on theother;and in such cases therewillalwaysbe thegreatest dangerthatthedecisionwillbe regulatedmorebythecomparative strengthof parties,thanbythe real demonstrationosf innocenceor guilt." 
The importanceof prosecution, withimpeachmentas itsleading case, as a weapon of recurrent groupconflictbecomesmoreimportantas each side disputesthe moralityand themethodsof the other. 
Politicalleadershave alreadylost too muchof the lessonsof how to tradewitheach otherand learned insteadto turneach conflictintoa dramaticmoralityplay,or to an occasion of politicalvengeance.The magnificationof conflictis somethingwe have seen before.Congress should[do] nothingfurtherto let thislion loose in the streets.Prudence and wisdomargueforterminatingthisprocess.Close the cage.
