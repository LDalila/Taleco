I.  THE  PHILOSOPHERS'  BRIEF

the  Court 

The  assisted  suicide  cases  are  the  most  dramatic  to  come  before  the
Supreme  Court  in  recent  years,  and  one  of  the  most  striking  (and  certainly
well-publicized)  documents  before 
is  widely  known  as  The
Philosophers' Brief.'  The  Brief bears  Ronald  Dworkin's  distinctive  mark,
and  indeed  Dworkin  is  listed  as  lead  counsel,  though  the  Brief is  also  signed
by  Thomas  Nagel,  Robert  Nozick,  John  Rawls,  Thomas  Scanlon,  and  Judith
Jarvis  Thompson.  The  Philosophers' Brief offers  an  ambitious  and  highly
theoretical  argument. 
It  says  that  some  "deeply  personal  decisions  pose
controversial  questions  about  how  and  why  human  life  has  value. 
In  a  free
society,  individuals  must  be  allowed  to  make  those  decisions  for  themselves,
out  of their  own  faith,  conscience,  and  convictions." 2  The  Brief urges  that
distinctions  between  "omissions"  (failing  to provide  continued  treatment)  and
"acts" 
"based  on  a
misunderstanding  of  the  pertinent  moral  principles. "3   Drawing  on  the
abortion  cases,  the  Brief says  that  every  person  "has  a  right  to  make  the
'most 
to  personal  dignity  and
autonomy,'"  a  right  that  encompasses  "some  control  over  the  time  and
manner  of  one's  death." 4   The  Brief thus  urges  the  Court  to  declare  a
constitutional  right  to  physician-assisted  suicide.  Dworkin's  personal  gloss
on  the  Brief says  that  the  requested  right  "defines  a  very  general  moral  and

invoke  fundamental 

arguments, 

this  disagreement  helps  get  to 

As  a  matter  of political  morality,  the  argument  in  the  Philosopher's
Brief is  certainly  reasonable,  and  it cannot  easily  be  shown  to  be wrong.  But
I  do  not  think  that  the  Supreme  Court  should  declare  a  right  to  physician-
assisted  suicide,  and 
the  heart  of  my
disagreements  with  Professor  Dworkin. 
I  believe  that  the  Court  should
generally  be  reluctant  to  invalidate  legislation  on  the  basis  of  abstract
philosophical  arguments,  because  the  Court  is  poorly  equipped  to  evaluate
those 
on  which
philosophical  arguments  tend  to  be  silent,  matter  a  great  deal  to  law.  By
contrast,  Dworkin  appears  to  think  that  the  Supreme  Court  should  not  much
hesitate  to  find  a  constitutional  right  of  some  kind  if  it  is  presented  with
(what judges  can  be  persuaded  to  find)  convincing  philosophical  arguments
for that right,  at least if the  right  "fits"  with the  rest  of the  legal  fabric.  Thus
while  Professor  Dworkin  and  I  do  not  much  disagree  on  what  justice
requires,  we  do  disagree,  hardly  all  the  time  but  I  suspect  not  rarely,  about
the appropriate  path of the Supreme  Court of the  United  States.

and  because  predicted  consequences, 

Yet  I  find  much  to  accept,  and  to  admire,  in  Professor  Dworkin's

incoherent-hopeless  for  law  or  for  anything  else.  An  argument  for
incompletely  theorized  agreements  cannot  sensibly  be  rooted  in  skepticism.
(Hence  there  is  all  the  difference  in  the  world  between  skepticism  and  a
recognition  of  cognitive  or  motivational  limitations  on  the  part  of  certain
people  engaged  in  distinctive  social  roles.)  As  an  abstraction  or  a  creed,
"antitheory"  makes  no  sense.  The  notion  of  "justificatory  ascent"  rightly
signals  the  fact  that  a judge may  have to  get  ambitious  in  order to  think  well
about  some  cases. 9  Dworkin  is  correct  to  say  that  "there  is  no  a  priori  or
wholesale  test  for deciding  when  [such  an  ascent]  will be  required.  A  lawyer
or  judge  must  be  well  along  in  thinking  about  an  issue  before  he  knows

I  like  especially  what  he  says  here  about  Richard  Rorty,  whose  position  (by  the  way)
ought  not  to be  taken  to represent  pragmatism.  John Dewey,  for example,  had  no  problem  speaking
in terms  of objectivity;  and  the  same is  true  for  Hilary  Putnam,  whose  self-described  pragmatism  is,
I think,  close  to Dewey's  version.

and  professional  grounds 

It  is  also  true  that  any  analogical  argument  depends  on  an  argument
of some kind,  and hence  on  a theory  of some  kind.  The  distinction  between
for  distrusting  philosophical
metaphysical 
abstractions  is  quite  important.  Dworkin's  suggestion  that my  own  argument
rests  on  "professional"  (or  role-dependent)  grounds  is  entirely  right.  And
Dworkin  has  described  my  own  position  with  both  courtesy  and  care;  for

that  those  who  celebrate  incompletely  theorized  agreements  in  a  qualified
way  are,  in  important  respects,  in the  same  basic  camp  as Dworkin."  And it
is  nice  to  see  an  essay  praising  theory  begin with  the  suggestion,  "Examples
are better  than  anything  ....."12

With  all  this  agreement,  why  might  anyone  be  reluctant  to  join  a
chorus  of praise  for  abstraction  in  law?  There  are  three  reasons.  The  first  is
mostly  a  matter  of emphasis;  the  second  is  more  substantial,  though  in  the
end  it may  be  a  matter  of emphasis  too;  the  third  involves  the  limited  role  of
it  lies  at  the  heart  of  my
the  Court  in  the  constitutional  system,  and 
disagreement  with  the  Philosophers' Brief.  My  basic  suggestions  are  that
Dworkin  places  too  little  emphasis  on  the  need  to  attend  to  facts,  which  are
crucial  to  law,  and  gives  too  little  attention  to  issues  of  institutional  role,
which are  a central part  of constitutional  law,  Dworkin's  particular  concern.

II.  INCOMPLETELY  THEORIZED  AGREEMENTS  AS  ORDINARY  PRACTICE

Judges  ordinarily  work  with  principles  of a  low  level  of  theoretical
ambition.  Conceptual  ascents  are  relatively  rare  in  law.  Like  all  of  us,
judges  have  limited  time  and  capacities,  and  like  almost  all of us,  judges  are
not  trained  philosophers.  They  know  that  if  they  try  to  resolve  large
philosophical  issues,  they may  blunder badly.  In  these  circumstances  judges
try,  to  the  extent  that  they  can,  to  bracket  large-scale  issues  of the  good  and
the  right,  and  to  decide  cases  on  grounds  that  seem  reasonable  to  those  who
have  diverse  views  on  those  issues,  and  (perhaps  even  more  important)  to
those  who have  little  idea  what,  on those  issues,  their views  are.

Certainly  we  are  united  in  our  opposition  to  those  who  think  that  legal  decisions  can  or
should  be  decided  on  the  basis  of some  "original  meaning,"  to be  invoked  and characterized  without
reference  to  moral  or  political  arguments  at  all.  See  generally ANTONIN  SCALIA,  A  MATTER  OF

ARIZONA  STATE  LAW  JOURNAL

[Ariz.  St.  L.J.

This  point  helps  explain  the  legal  culture's  distrust  of philosophical
abstractions  and  its  comparative  fondness  for  both  rules  and  analogies.
Many  rules  can  attract  support  from  plural  foundations-consider  a  speed
limit  law,  or  liability  for  intentional  torts-and  hence  rules  help  make
possible  a  form  of cooperation  that  is  indispensable  to  a pluralistic  society. 13
A  great  virtue  of  analogical  thinking  is  that  it  often  assists  in  this  same
endeavor,  for  people  who  are  uncertain  about  large-scale  issues  can  often
conclude  that,  whatever  they  think,  they  agree  that  X  is  like  Y,  for  a
relatively  lower-level  reason  on  which  they  can  converge.  To  engage  in
analogical  thinking,  we  need  not,  much  of  the  time,  attempt  to  think  in
highly  ambitious terms.

This  idea  of course  has  a resemblance  and  owes  a  great  deal  to  John
Rawls'  idea  of  an  overlapping  consensus.14  But  there  is  a  difference.  The
overlapping  consensus  is  itself highly  theorized  and  a matter  of abstractions.
Rather  like  Dworkin,  Rawls  is concerned  to  show  that when  people  disagree
on  particulars  they  can  make  progress  by  ascending  to  a  level  of  greater
theoretical  ambition.' 5  This  is  true;  it  helps  explain  the  role  of conceptual
ascent  in both  politics  and  law  (and  science  too).  But  something  different  is
also  true:  People  can  often  agree  on particulars  when they  disagree  about  or
are  uncertain  on  abstractions.  Conceptual  or justificatory  descents may  well
work  best.

This point  is  particularly  important  for  law  within  a highly  pluralistic
culture. 
It  is  important  because  it  is  a  way  of promoting  stability,  reducing
strains  on  time  and  capacities,  and  demonstrating  mutual  respect;  it  is  not
very  respectful  to  take  on  other  people's  most  fundamental  commitments
when  it  is  not  necessary  to  do  so.? 6  We  might  even  think  that  those  who
stress  incompletely  theorized  agreements  believe  that  ordinary 
law  and
politics  bear  the  same  relation  to  political  liberalism  as  political  liberalism
bears  to  the  great  questions  in  moral  metaphysics.  Just  as  Rawls  aspires  to
"leave  philosophy  as  it  is,"  by  bracketing  the  large  questions  in  general
philosophy,  so  participants  in  law  and  politics  seek,  if  they  can,  to  leave
political  philosophy  very  much  as  it  is,  by  bracketing  the  large  disputes  in
political  philosophy,  such  as  the  dispute  between  political  liberalism  and
perfectionist  liberalism.

In  much  of his  work,  Dworkin  has  emphasized  the  value  of abstract
theorizing  in  law,  and  he  invokes  abstractions  to  assist  in  the  decision  of

It  may  be  that  Dworkin  thinks  (as  many  do)  that  theories  and
than  that. 
abstractions  have  a  kind  of reliability  that  particular judgments  lack,  whereas
I  think  (with  Rawls)  that  neither  particular, nor  general  judgments  should  be
treated  as  foundational  for  law  or  morality. 
In  moral  thinking,  everything
(concrete  and  abstract)  is  subject  to  potential  revision  as  we  deliberate,  and
in  both  morality  and  law,  theories  have  no  special  priority  simply  because
they  are  general  and  abstract.  But  it  is  not  at  all  clear  that  Dworkin
disagrees  with this  point.

If our  difference  is  only  one  of emphasis,  why  might  it  matter?  To
take  a  large  example,  the  difference  bears  on  the  whole  idea  of  substantive
due  process  and  thus  on  the  dispute  over  Roe  v.  Wade, 18  whose  basic
outcome  Dworkin  enthusiastically  defends.  Unlike  Dworkin,  those  who
favor  incompletely  theorized  agreements  are  uncertain  about  the  very  idea  of
a  "right  to  privacy."  They  seek  more  cautious  grounds;  they  are  reluctant  to
invoke  large-scale  abstractions  about  any  such  right  in  order  to  invalidate  the
outcomes  of  political  processes.  And  if  courts  had  sought  incompletely
theorized  agreements,  they  would  have  proceeded  very  differently.  For
example,  they might have  been moved  to  decide  Griswold v.  Connecticut19-
the  beginning  of  the  modem  excursion  into  substantive  due  process-not  on
the  basis  of that  highly  contentious  right,  but  on  some  more  modest  ground.

that  left  most  women  unaffected  and  operated  only  to  prevent  poor  women
from  getting  contraceptives  from  clinics. 20 -  Thus  it  might  be  concluded  that
the  statute  was  a  largely  irrational  and  discriminatory  means  of promoting  its
own  asserted  goals.  A  fact-driven  opinion,  bracketing  the  most  controversial
questions,  would  have  said  little  about  a  right  whose  scope  need  not  have
been  much  defined  in  Griswold itself.  Or  the  Court  might  have  decided  the

the criminal  law  lapses  when  that  provision  appears  to  lack  any  real  support
from  its  own  citizenry,  so  much  so  that  it  has  not,  in  many  decades,  been
invoked  by  any prosecutor  in  any  prosecution. 2 1

Professor  Dworkin  appears  to celebrate  Roe  v.  Wade;  he  thinks  that
the  decision  reflects  the  right  conception  of  constitutional  liberty  under  law,
and  that  (for  that  reason)  the  case  was  rightly  decided. 
I think  that  the
decision  has  created  unnecessary  problems  for  the  Court  and  the  nation. 
It
did  so  because  in  its  (wholly  unnecessary)  breadth  and  in  its  blindness  to
matters  of  fact  and  institutional  role  (on  which  more  below),  the  Court  did
too  much  too  soon,  in  a  way  that  has  had  enduring  harmful  effects  on
American  life  (emphatically  including  that part  of American  life  that involves
equality  on the  basis  of sex 2 3).

I  am  not  arguing  that  Roe  v.  Wade  should  have  been  decided  the
other  way;  but  the  Court  ought  not  to  have  invoked  ambitious  abstractions
about  privacy  or  liberty  to  resolve  so  many  issues  so  quickly.  A  court  that
favored  incompletely  theorized  agreements  would  have decided  Roe  v.  Wade
quite  narrowly.  The  Court  might have  said,  for  example,  that the  Texas  law
was  unconstitutionally  vague  (as  Justice  Blackmun's  initial  draft  in  fact
argued).  Or  it  might have  said that  someone  who alleges  (as  did  Roe  herself)
that she  was  raped may  not  be  required  to bring  the  child to  term.  Or-if the
Court eventually  was  forced  to  think  more  ambitiously-the  Court may  have
bracketed  issues  involving  the  political  and  moral  status  of  the  fetus  and
argued  that  if men  are  not  obliged  to  devote  their bodies  to  the  protection  of
third  parties,  women  may  not  be  so  obliged  either. 24  This  view  also  requires
a  degree  of  theoretical  ambition,  but  perhaps  it  is  less  contentious  if  it

80-86  (1991)  (describing  various  approaches  to  the  relationship  between  majoritarian  preferences
and  the judicial  branch  of government).  Of course  there  is a  degree  of  theoretical  ambition  in the
notion  of desuetude,  and  it  is  probably  unproductive  to debate  in  what  sense  that  notion  calls  for
more  or  less  ambition  than  the  notion  of privacy. 
In  my  view,  the  more  difficult  and  contentious
questions  raised  by  a  right  to privacy  could  have  been  bracketed  through  this  democracy-promoting
device.  What  is  crucial  is  that  the  notion  of desuetude  (which  creates  a  kind  of  "remand"  to  the
public)  leaves  much  undecided  and  is  less  of  a  displacement  of  democratic  prerogatives  than  the
right of privacy.

the  fetus.25

It  does  not  much  matter 

if  any  of  these  particular  claims 

is
convincing;  I  offer  them  simply  for purposes  of illustration.  What  matters  is
that  those  who  stress  incompletely  theorized  agreements  on  particulars  are
likely  to  seek  to  avoid  conceptual  ascents  if (and  only  if) they  can,  especially
when  courts  are  asked  to  invalidate  legislation  on  constitutional  grounds.
This  idea  leads  in  directions  that  Professor  Dworkin  appears  to  reject.  But
perhaps  this  point  is  really  about  institutional  issues-or  about  profession-
specific  norms-on  which more in  a  moment.

My  second  difference  with  Professor  Dworkin-and  I  am  not  sure
that it  is a  disagreement-involves  the  role  of facts. 
In my  view,  the  greatest
achievement  of  the  well-known  Chicago  School 
incompletely
theorized  agreement  may  be  possible  on  this  point)  has  been  to  draw
attention  to  the  central  importance  of facts  to  an understanding  of law.  What
does  law  actually  do?  This  is  a  question  on  which  the  content  of law  must
(at  least  partly)  depend,  and  it  is  a  question  that  lawyers  and judges  ask  too
infrequently,  and  answer  with  inadequate  tools.  What,  for  example,  are  the
effects  of laws  calling  for minimum  wages,  rent  controls,  implied  warranties
of  various  sorts,  liability  for  drug  manufacturers?  Philosophy  alone  will  not
tell  us;  we  need  to  investigate  facts.  And  much  of normative jurisprudence,
with  its  heavy  philosophical  bent,  continues  to  operate  in  a  factual  vacuum.

how  to  approach  the  product  liability  questions  that  Professor  Dworkin  raises
without  investigating  a  range  of  factual  details;  judicial  assessment  of
philosophical  claims-figuring  out  what  is  "fair"-is  at  most  a  start. 
If
courts  imposed  liability  on  DES  manufacturers  without  a  demonstration  of

liability  produce  sharply  diminished  incentives  to  produce  new  medicines?
These  questions  can  hardly  be  irrelevant.  What  policy  for  products  liability

seems  poorly  suited  to  judicial  (not  to  mention  jury)  capacities.  Partly  for
this  reason,  the  topic  is  increasingly  removed  from  the judiciary  and  placed
in  the  hands  of people  who know  much  more  about  underlying  facts  and  also
have  a  better  democratic  pedigree. 
The  Consumer  Product  Safety
Commission  ("CPSC")  does  not  spend  most  of  its  time  on  philosophical
issues;  surely  the  CPSC  would  do  better  if it  were  both  concerned  with  and
capable  of  philosophical  analysis,  but  it  would  be  a  stretch  to  say  that
philosophical  confusion  is  the  principal  source  of existing  problems  with  the
CPSC.

institutional
development  of  the  twentieth  century.  Because  it  is  a  sensible  response  to
institutional  limitations  of the  judiciary-limitations  involving  not  theory  (as
Dworkin  understands  it)  but  understandings  of  fact  and  consequences-that
movement  is  (mostly)  to  be  celebrated.  Of  course  Professor  Dworkin  is
aware  of the  development,  but  in his  work  on  legal  interpretation  he  does not
much discuss  it.  The  gap  is  notable  in  light of the  fact that,  in what  is  by  far
the  most  important  case  on  legal  interpretation  in  the  last  two  decades,  the
Supreme  Court ruled  that precisely  because  interpretation  involves  judgments
of  policy  and  principle,  ambiguous  statutes  will  be 
interpreted  by  the
regulatory  agencies  entrusted  with  their implementation.2 9

Now  of  course  any  assessment  of facts  is  theory-laden;  as  Dworkin
rightly  stresses,  we  do  not  know  what  and  how  facts  count  unless  we  have  a
(normative)  account.  Nothing  I  have  said  here  denies  this  point.  But  many
legal  debates  are  sterile-conceptualistic, 
precisely  because  the  participants  do  not  investigate  facts,  when  it  is  facts  on
which they  may be  able  to  make  some  progress.  Perhaps  most  important,  an
understanding  of  the  facts  may  well  equip  people  with  different  theoretical
positions  to  converge  on  the  same judgment.  If,  for  example,  an  increase  in
rent  control  can  be  shown  to  diminish  the  available  housing  stock,  in  a  way
that  particularly  hurts  the  poor,  perhaps  people  can  reject  rent  control

The  point bears  on  approaches  to  legal  interpretation  as  well,  where
an assessment  of relevant  facts  can  be  quite  important.  To  see  the  point,  let
us  turn to  two  cases  of considerable  interest  to  Professor  Dworkin.  In Riggs
v.  Palmer, 
the  New  York  Court  of Appeals  held  that  a  nephew,  who  had
murdered  his  uncle  in  order  to  inherit  from  him,  could  not  receive  his
inheritance,  notwithstanding 
language  of  the  statutes
governing  wills  made  no  exception  for  murderers. 31  The  Court  carved  out
an exception  from  the  apparently  plain  language  of the  statute.

that  the
Endangered  Species  Act prohibited  the  government  from  completing  a  dam,
because  completion  would  endanger  the  snail  darter,  a  fish of little  ecological
interest. 33  The  Court  refused  to  carve  out  an  exception  from  the  apparently
plain  language  of  the  statute.  Professor  Dworkin  thinks  that  Riggs  was
rightly  decided  and  TVA  v.  Hill wrongly  decided,  because  the  court's  task  is
to  make  the  best  constructive  sense  of  a  past  legislative  event,  a  task  that
called  for judgments  against  the  nephew  and  for  the TVA. 34

I  do  not  disagree  so  much  with  the  proposed  results  as  with  this

In  my  view,  a  great  deal  depends  on
issues  involving  incentives  and  comparative  competence,  and  these  have  a
large  empirical  dimension.  On  this  count  there  are many  relevant  questions.
What  incentives  would  be  created  for  legislatures  by  decisions  like  Riggs  v.
Palmer,  or  by  judicial 
(as  the  dissenting  judge  urged)  on
mechanical  application  of the  apparently  unambiguous  text?  Would  the  latter
course  lead  legislatures  to  be  more  careful  in  advance,  and might  they  enact
exceptions  after  the  fact  when  exceptions  make  sense?  Would  the  costs  of
decision,  including  the  problem  of  legal  uncertainty,  much  increase  if  courts
were  willing  to  decide  cases  the  way  Professor  Dworkin  wants?  What  is  the
likelihood

[Ariz.  St.  L.J.

For what  it  is  worth,  I  believe  that  Riggs  v.  Palmer was  right  (and
thus  I  agree  with  Dworkin),  because  (to  make  a  long  story  short)  no
reasonable  person could  want  a  murderer  to  inherit,  and  because  this  easily-
contained  exception  from  the  statute  would  cause  little  increase  in  legal
uncertainty.  And  I  believe  that  TVA  v.  Hill was  also  right  (and  I  disagree
here  with  Dworkin),  because  reasonable  people  could  seek  to  protect  the
snail  darter  under  the  circumstances  of  the  case  and  because  this  (hard  to
confine)  exception  from  the  statute  would  create  a  great  deal  of doubt  about
the  future  meaning  of  the  Endangered  Species  Act.  But  these  conclusions
are  far  less  important  than  the  claim  that  an  assessment  of  the  underlying
issues  requires  not  only  conceptual  analysis  about  what  makes  something
"law,"  or  some particular  law  the best  it  can be,  but also  a  set  of predictions,

Some  members  of  the  most  prominent  Chicago  School,  and  here  I
happily  join  that  School,  may be  against  (some  kinds  of)  theory  in  the  (very
limited)  sense  that  they  are  pro-facts.  To  the  extent  that  there  is  a  single
message  in  Judge  Posner's  Overcoming Law, 
I  think  that  this  is  it.  In  this
respect  Professor  Dworkin's  emphasis  on  the  (occasional)  need  for  good
theory  strikes  me  not  so  much  wrong-indeed  it  is  not  wrong  at  all-as
misdirected. 
It  suggests  that  a  better  legal  system  will  come  from  a  legal
system  that  is  better  at  philosophy-as  if  the  real  flaw  of  American  law  is
inadequate  philosophy.  This,  again,  is  not  without  truth;  better  philosophy
might  well  make  law  better-more  fair,  coherent,  less  confused-in  some
contexts.  But any  claim  of this  sort  should  be  supplemented  by  an  emphasis
on  the  need  for  a  better  sense  of underlying  facts.  Does  the  problem  with

of sports.  In  the  1997  playoffs,  five  New  York  Knicks  players  left  the  bench  during  a  fight  on the
court,  and  National  Basketball  Association  officials  suspended  the  players  in  accordance  with  a  rule
that  calls  for an  automatic  suspension  whenever  players  leave  the  bench  during  a  fight.  One  of  the
suspended  players,  Patrick  Ewing,  left  the  bench  but  did  not  get  close  to  the  melee.  Did  the  NBA
officials  properly  interpret  the  rule?  Professor  Dworkin  thinks  not.  He  says,  "You  don't  punish
people  for acts  that  not only  don't cause  harm,  but  aren't  even of the kind  to cause  the  harm  that  the
statute  was  designed  to  prevent."  See Asking Around,  NEW  YORKER,  June  2,  1997,  at  35.  But  an
important  question  is  whether  attention  to  the  purpose  of  the  rule  ("the  harm  that  the  statute  was
designed  to  prevent")  significantly  increases  the  costs  of  decision  (and  uncertainty)-and  also
introduces  risks  of  error  of  its  own,  partly  because  of  bias,  partly  because  of  difficulties 
in
accurately  characterizing  the  purposes  of the  rule.  Hence  Dworkin-a  New  Yorker  and  perhaps  a
Knicks  fan?-seems  to  me  not  to  have  come  to  terms  with  the  best  arguments  on  behalf  of  the
officials'  mechanical  and  on one  view  extremely  wonderful  interpretation  of  the rule.  (On  the other
hand,  candor  compels  the perhaps  unsurprising  confession  that  the present  author  tends  to  favor  the
World  Champion  Chicago  Bulls.)

the  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  or  courts  reviewing  EPA  rules,  lie
(principally)  in  inadequate  normative  theory?  Exactly  how  valuable  would  a
conceptual  ascent  be  to  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission,  the  Federal
Communications  Commission,  or 
the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health
Administration,  and  to  courts  assessing  their  activities?  The  answer  is  not
that  it  would have  no  value  at  all.  But  it  is  only  part  of the  picture,  and  the
remaining  part  helps  show  the  limitations  of  theory  to  an  understanding  of
law.

law 

The  same  basic  point  applies  to  the  law  of  tort  as  tort  law  is
too,  emphatically

developed  by  judges; 
it  bears  on  constitutional 
including  the  right  to  physician-assisted  suicide.  This  point-I  have  said-
may  not  amount  to  a  disagreement  with  Professor  Dworkin,  but  it  has
concrete  consequences  for  how  to  do  and  to  think  about  law.  For  example,
the  philosophical  abstractions  offered  in  the  Philosopher's Brief seem  to  me
reasonable;  certainly  it  cannot  easily  be  shown  that  they  are  wrong.  But
(even  putting  the  institutional  issues  to  one  side),  do  they make  out a  case  for
a  constitutional  right,  invalidating  enacted  law  in  almost  all  states?  I  do  not
believe  that  they  do. 37   Even  if  the  theoretical  claims  are  right,  much
depends  on empirical  projections.

For  example,  a  crucial  question  is  whether,  in  practice,  a  right  to
physician-assisted  suicide  may  actually  reduce  patient  autonomy,  by  leading
doctors  to  bring  about  involuntary  or  nonvoluntary  suicide;  by  decreasing
autonomy  especially  among  people  who  are  poor  or  ill-educated,  who  may
become  unduly  vulnerable  to  doctors;  or  by  discouraging  patients,  families,
and  doctors  from  coming  to  terms  with  the  fact  of death.  These  questions

that
philosophy  alone  can  answer;  they  are  insistently  empirical.  Some  students
of the  Dutch  experience  believe  that  a  right  to physician-assisted  suicide  has,
in  practice,  promoted  the  autonomy  of  doctors  and  decreased  the  autonomy
of  patients,  leading  patients  to  take  their  lives  when  far  better  alternatives
were  available. 38  Perhaps  this  is  not  the  best  understanding  of  the  Dutch
experience, 39  but  even  if it  is  not,  what  would  a  right  to  physician-assisted
suicide  mean  in  America,  with  its  very  different  norms?

what a  right  to physician-assisted  suicide  would mean  in practice,  oppose  any
such  right.)

In  my  view,  the  Philosophers' Brief is  not  convincing  (a  normative
as  well  as  empirical  claim)  largely  because  it  does  not  sufficiently  explore
institutional  issues or  concerns  of the  sort just  raised-the  inevitable  focus  of
the  Court itself4°-and  mostly  relies  instead  on  a  combination  of  (reasonable)
philosophical  abstractions  and  passages  from  Supreme  Court  decisions.  To
be  sure,  the  Brief is  not  oblivious  to  the underlying  problems,  and  it makes  a
reference  in  this  regard  to  the  need  for  procedural  safeguards  to  counteract
those  problems.  But  such  safeguards,  however  well-designed  they  may  be
on paper,  cannot  alleviate  the underlying  concerns,  which  are  (it  is  necessary
to  emphasize)  empirical  rather  than  a  priori  in  character.  A  possible
conclusion  is  that  the  federal  system  is  admirably  well-adapted  to  deal  with

now  embarking  on  such  an  experiment,  and  other  states  will  undoubtedly
follow.  We  should  know  what  such  a  right  would  mean  in  practice  before
we  insist  that  it  should  exist in  law.

IV.  JUDICIAL CAPACITIES  AND  THE  JUDICIAL  ROLE

Who  could  possibly  object  to the  adoption,  by judges  or  anyone  else,
of a  good  theory  about  the  right  or  the  good?  If judges  are  able  to  identify
the  appropriate  category  of rights,  shouldn't  they?  If a  conception  of rights
embodies  the  appealing  notion  that  a  heterogeneous  society  consists  of  a
community  of  equals,  why  shouldn't  the  Court  identify  that  (by  hypothesis)
very  appealing  conception?  Dworkin,  asking  such  questions, 
is  puzzled
about why  anyone  would  want  our judges  to  be  ostriches.  Isn't an  antipathy
to theory  a kind  of willful  blindness,  or  a  form  of philistinism?

Judges  are  not  ostriches,  and  their  caution  about  theory  stems  from
the  distinctive  place  where  they  stand,  which  requires  an  understanding  of
the  particular  role  of judges  in  the  American  political  system.  Cognitive
limitations,  accepted  as  such  by  participants  in  all  social  practices,  are  a
central  part  of  any  account  of  the  responsibilities  of  those  who  find

in

We  can  find  many  instances  of (what  Professor  Dworkin  and  I  would  agree

and  Richmond  v.
Sanford,  Lochner  v.  New  York,  Buckley  v.  Valeo, 
Croson.44  In  all of these  cases,  courts  invoked  theoretically  ambitious  claims
about  liberty  and equality  to  invalidate  legislation.  In the  first  two  cases,  the
nation  lived  with  the  consequences  for  a  very  long  time.  In  the  second  two
cases,  the  nation  lives  with  the  consequences  still.

42 

But  these  cases  are  aberrations,  and  thankfully  so.  A  large  part  of
the  distinctive  morality  of  adjudication  is  role-morality,  and  it  involves  the
presumptive  avoidance  of theoretically  ambitious  arguments  as  a  ground  for
invalidating  enacted  law.  Thus  courts  generally  seek,  because  of  their  own
understanding  of  their  limited  capacities,  to  offer  low-level  rationales  on

consequence  of theoretical  ambition  would  be  to  invalidate  the  outcomes  of
democratic  processes;  it  is  here  that  the  Court properly  proceeds  cautiously,
again  because  of its  understanding  of  its  limited  capacities  in  thinking  about
philosophical  abstractions.  And  it  is  notable  that an  emphasis  on  these  points
focuses  attention  on  institutions  and  practices  that  Dworkin's  enthusiasm  for
philosophical  argument  tends  to  obscure:  administrative  agencies,  state-by-
state  experimentation,  and legislative  rather  than judicial  solutions.

An analogy  may  be  helpful here.  Of course  there is  a  sense  in which
philosophy  is  foundational  to  law,  just as  theoretical  physics  is  in  some  sense
foundational  to  the  construction  of airplanes.  And  at  times  those  who  build
airplanes  need to  know  something  about  theoretical  physics.  But  in  ordinary
practice,  those  confronted  with  the  problems  produced  by  the  construction  of
airplanes  are  not  assisted  by  accounts  of  the  foundations  of  physics;  such

lawyers.  The  issues raised  by  the  asserted  right  to  physician-assisted  suicide
require,  among  other  things,  intense  focus  on  particulars  and  (especially
important)  close  attention  to  facts.  Would  such  a  right, 
in  practice,
undermine  the  autonomy  of  those  approaching  death,  and  give  excessive

[Ariz.  St.  L.J.

Questions  of  this  kind  suggest  that  the  Court  was  correctly  wary  about
accepting  the  argument  in  the  Philosophers' Brief, not  because  the  argument
is  necessarily  wrong,  but because  judges,  in  light  of their  limited  role  in  the
should  be  cautious  about  accepting  abstract
constitutional  structure, 
arguments  on  behalf  of  rights  whose  real-world  consequences  are  hard  to
predict.

I  am speaking  of a presumption,  or a  mood,  and  not of a  rule.  Three
qualifications  are worth  mentioning.  First,  it is possible  that  an  incompletely
theorized  agreement  might  be  reached  on  the  presumption,  but  outside
observers  might  well  attempt  to  offer  a  more  ambitious  argument  on  its
behalf.  The  presumptive  argument  for  incompletely  theorized  agreements,
in  its  fullest  form,  depends  on  some  (controversial)  abstractions.  Second,
exceptions  to  the  presumption  might  be  made  when  the  abstractions  are
clearly  right;  consider  Brown v.  Board of Education.4 5  Sometimes  a period
of  common-law  development  can  show  that  an  ambitious  argument  is  too
insistent  to  be  ignored.  This  was  the  case  in  Brown,  and  it  may  eventually
be  the  case  in the  context  of discrimination  on  the basis  of sexual  orientation.
Third,  the  grounds  for judicial  humility-for judicial  reluctance  to  disturb  the
results  of  democratic  processes  on  the  basis  of  philosophical  abstractions-
are undercut  when  it  can  be  shown  that  political  processes  are defective  from
internal  morality  of
the  standpoint  of  what  we  might  consider 
democracy.46  Thus courts  should  be  less  reluctant  to  invoke  abstractions  as  a
basis  for  invalidating  enacted  law  when  the  relevant  law  excludes  people
from  political  participation,  or  when  it  undermines  the  right  to  freedom  of
political  speech.

the 

Of  course  these  conclusions  raise  many  questions,  and  they  are
themselves  theory-laden.47  Most of the  ordinary  work of law  is  incompletely
theorized,  and  hence  courts  have  not  self-consciously  adopted  theoretical
arguments  on  behalf  of  the  latter  two  qualifications,  even  though  the  law
generally  seems  to  follow  them.  To  defend  the  qualifications,  it  would  be
necessary  to  make  some  claims  about  institutional  capacities  and  the  nature
and  primacy  of democratic  self-government.  And  the  view  that  the  judicial
role  is  properly  aggressive  when  democratic  obstacles  beset ordinary  politics
may  itself  have  to  be  theorized,  both  in  defending  the  general  claim  and  in
specifying  it by  giving  content  to  the  notion of democratic  obstacles.

that 

I  think 

these  theoretically  ambitious  arguments  should  be
accepted  by  courts,  as  indeed  they  largely  have  been,  because  and  to  the
extent  that  they  can  be  shown  to  be  clearly  true.  What  must  be  emphasized
is  that  these  arguments  suggest-and  there  really  is  no  contradiction  here-
that  the  distinctive  morality  of  adjudication  in  a  pluralistic  society  calls  for  a
presumption  in  favor  of  theoretical  modesty,  especially  when  courts  are
asked  to  invalidate  legislation.

It 

is  here  that  my  difference  from  Professor  Dworkin  has  some
consequences. 
In  the  context  of  the  right  to  physician-assisted  suicide,  an
incompletely  theorized  agreement  in  favor  of  invalidation  seems  hard  to
obtain. 8  Judges  who  sit  on the  Supreme  Court are  rightly  reluctant  to  reject
the  considered  moral  judgments  of  their  fellow  citizens.  The  reluctance
might  be  overcome  if  those moral  judgments  were  plainly  wrong,  or  if there
was  a  problem  in  the  system  of  democratic  deliberation  that  has  produced
barriers  to  physician-assisted  suicide.  But  the  moral  issues  are  complex,  in
large  part  because  reasonable  people  believe  that  in  practice  a  right  to
physician-assisted  suicide  would  undermine  patient  autonomy, 
rightly
understood.  In  these  circumstances  courts  should  be  cautious  about  invoking
philosophical  abstractions

Dworkin  responds  to  the  plea  for  judicial  modesty 

largely  by
invoking  the  fact  that  the  Court  has  been  invested  with  the  power  of judicial
review.  He  thinks  that  I  have  confused  the  question  of jurisdiction  with  the
question  of justification.  But  I  wonder  whether  the  confusion  is  not  his
rather  than  mine.  The  existence  of jurisdiction-of judicial  review-is  quite

731-43  (2d  Cir.  1996)  (Calabresi,  J.,  concurring).

It  would  probably  be  better  if
the Court had  been  able  to  suspend judgment  on the  issue  of physician-assisted  suicide,  at  least  for  a
time;  it  is  most  unfortunate  that  American  law  lacks  an  explicit  doctrine  of  timing,  allowing
suspension  of a  constitutional  decision  until  the  nation  has  had  more experience  with  the  underlying
practice. 
Id.  at  2275.  Because  of  the  importance  of  facts,  and  the  complexity  of  the  moral
questions,  more  practice  would  be  desirable  before  the  Court  comes  to  closure.  I therefore  agree
with  Professor Dworkin's  suggestion-intended  as  a  second-best  substitute  for  invalidation-that  the
Court  might  have  done  well  to  think  seriously  about  techniques  for  suspending  judgment  on  the
constitutionality  of physician-assisted  suicide.  Alternatively,  the Court  might,  in  cases  of this  kind,
attempt  an  incompletely  theorized  agreement  in  the  form  of  a  "remand"  of constitutionally  sensitive
issues  to the  public,  as,  for  example,  through  a ruling  that  the  criminal  law  may  not be  invoked  in
certain  areas  without  a  focused,  recent  democratic  judgment  that  it  ought  to  be.  Two  prominent
enthusiasts  for  incompletely 
theorized  agreements-Professor  Bickel  and  Judge  Calabresi-are
associated  with  Yale,  but  they  may  well  be  taken  as charter  members  of  the  Chicago  School  insofar
as  they  have  sought  ways  to  enable  judges  to  bracket  high-level  moral  questions  in  the  interest  of
ensuring  more  in  the way  of democratic  deliberation.

American judges  have  a  wide  range  of devices  by  which  to  counteract  their

concrete  and  abstract,  both empirical  and  theoretical,  to think that judges  in  a

abstractions  when  they  can,  especially  if they  are asked  to  invalidate  enacted
