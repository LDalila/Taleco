M ANYpeople think that political outcomes can be "explained" as
productsof the influence of self-interested,well-organizedgroups with
highstakes in the outcome. Undoubtedlythis is often true. But causation
in politics is a complex matter.If we findthat a grouphas benefitedfrom
a publicpolicy, we know somethingimportant,but one thingwe do not
know is that the policy exists because it benefitsthat group. If controls
on automobileemissions are enactedin a periodin whichthe
labormovement is weakening, we know something, but we do not know that the
controlsare caused by the weakeningof the labormovement.These are
prosaic claims, but I think they have large implicationsfor many of the
argumentsof interest-grouptheory.</p>
      <p>Peltzman's intriguingarticle' is generally cautious. But in several
places, it becomes rather bold. In explainingthe decline of American
educationfrom 1960to 1980, Peltzmanclaims, "[T]he plausiblerule of
politicsis substantial."2Laterin the article, he says, "Industrypressure
does have a substantialeffect on performance."3These
claimsarereasonable, but we do not know that they are true. Both of them seem to me
inadequatelysupported. I conclude that Peltzman has generated
extremelyinterestingdata and shown some suggestivecorrelations.But he
has not yet made any real demonstrationof causation.</p>

I want to supportthis generalpoint with six particularquestions.
1. Did School Performance Really Deteriorate? Peltzman makes
strongargumentsfor the view that school performancedeterioratedfrom
1960to 1980,but the propositionremainsa bit blurred.4We do know that
ScholasticAptitudeTest (SAT) scores went down, but the SAT is taken
by a college-boundelite. Decreases in SAT scores do not necessarily
meandecreases in overall school performance.And thereis indeedsome
contrary evidence for high school students as a whole. For example,
nationalnormstudies-taken from 1955to 1983andincludinga nationally
representativesample of high school juniors-suggest a much steadier
set of scores. These studies do not reveal the same kindof decline as is
shown by the SAT trends. Othertests suggest similarresults. Indeed, a
federalstudy, ProjectTALENT, actuallyfounda slightgainin scores by
1970eleventh gradersover those by 1960eleventh graders.</p>
      <p>None of this demonstrates that Peltzman is wrong in claiming that
school performancedeteriorated.But it does suggestthe possibilitythat
the SAT decline shows a decline in performancefor elites, not for high
schoolers as a whole.5If this is so, the causal picturegets more
complicated. It may also be true that in 1960-80 the schools emphasizedskills
not pickedup by the SAT, a possibilitythatwouldintroduceeven greater
difficultiesinto the picture.</p>
      <p>2. What about Factors Independent of Schooling? School
performanceis almostcertainlya functionof family
structureandfamilybackground.6Childrenin two-parenthouseholdsappearto do
betterthanchildren with only one parent in the home.7We can speculate that school
childrendo less well if their parentsare in the midst of a divorce. It is
thus possible that the decline in SAT scores was attributableto factors
unrelatedto the educationalenvironment,narrowlydefined.</p>
      <p>Peltzmanwould do well to attemptto controlfor this
possibility,measuring his educational factors against noneducationalcauses. The
absence of such an effort makes it especially difficultto make confident
claims about causation.</p>
      <p>3. Timing Problems and the Aggregate Data. Peltzman explores
and sometimes seems to endorse the view that schools deterioratedin
partbecause of (a) the growth in labor unions and (b) shifts in financial

responsibilityfromlocal to state government.But if we look at the
aggregate data, we will find some general oddities. Between 1946and 1972,
the financingratios between local and state governmentremainedabout
the same. From 1946to 1950,the state fundedabout39 percent,whereas
local governmentfunded about 58 percent. By 1972, the state was still
funding39 percent, and local governmentwas fundingover 52
percenthardlya significantshift. And yet it was in the periodfrom 1961to 1972
that SAT scores were significantlydeclining. The aggregatedata thus
suggest a puzzle. The supposedly causal shift in financialresponsibility
did not occur at all duringa significantpartof the crucialperiod.</p>
      <p>The data for labor unions raise a similarissue. From 1961 to 1962,
there was a hugejump in National EducationAssociation (NEA)
membership-from less than 4 percent to 54 percent. But from 1962to 1971,
teacherunion density remainedroughlyconstant, risingto a statistically
insignificantlyincreasedlevel of 56.9 percent in 1971.Note againthat it
was in this very period-from the early 1960sto 1971-that SAT scores
were declining.The laborunion datapose an additionalpuzzle for
Peltzman since they suggest that teacher union density stayed
roughlyconstantwhile educational"output" declined.</p>
      <p>Perhapsthe disaggregateddata take care of the problem.Perhapswe
can thinkabout differencesin the natureof the NEA over time or about
the rise of the "badunion," the AmericanFederationof Teachers(AFT).
Buteven if this is so, Peltzman'sown, moreparticularfindingsundermine
the view that the data show a causal effect from unionizationand shifts
in financing.</p>
      <p>4. Labor Unions? Peltzmannotes thatthe evidence on laborunions
is mixed, because of matters of timing and detail.8 The disclaimer
seems necessary. School performanceactually seems to have improved
with the success of the NEA in the 1960sand 1970s.There is therefore
no evidence that the NEA contributedto a decline in education.There
appearsto be some correlationbetween such decline and success by the
AFT, but the data here are merelyfragmentary.The AFT has never had
a large percentageof teachers-somewhere between a tenth and a fifth
of teachers during the period of national SAT decline. Moreover, we
appear to have incomplete informationon AFT membershipbetween
1960and 1971. Surely there is too little evidence to claimcausationas a
resultof AFT membership,let aloneunionmembership.At the very best,
I thinkthat we have a mildly suggestive correlation.</p>
      <p>5. Shifts in Financing? There is apparentlya correlationbetween
the early shifts to state fundingand early declines in SAT performance.
8 Peltzman, supra note 1, at 352-56.
Butthereis no correlationat all betweenthe latershiftsto
statefundingthose in the 1980s-and SAT performance.For this reason Peltzman
concludes, consistentlywith the data, thatthe shift "is a symptomrather
than a cause."9 I am not certainwhat he means by this. But at least we
can agree that the data do not establish, or even stronglysuggest, that
the shift in financingproduceda decline in performance.Thus far, then,
the claimof causationseems unprovedwith respectto bothuniondensity
and financingpractices.</p>
      <p>6. Businesses? Peltzman's most strikingfindingis that school
performancedeclined in areas in which the use of educatedlaborby
politically importantemployees grew the most, and in which newly important
industriesused the most educated labor. As Peltzmanemphasizes, the
findingis stronglycounterintuitive.If industrypressurewas to have any
effect, one would expect school performanceto increase in precisely
those areas.</p>
      <p>Without more, we might think that this counterintuitivecorrelation
says absolutely nothing about causation. We might see this findingas
resemblinga demonstrationthat the performanceof a sportsteam, or the
economy of a foreigncountry, was correlatedwith shifts in SAT scores.
(Both of these are likely true.) Now it is possible to come up with a
plausiblestory to explain the anomaly-as Peltzmanhas in fact done.?1
But it is almost always possible for inventive people to come up with a
plausiblestory. The question is whetherwith respect to the causal role
of industrypressure, we have anythingmore than that. I think that on
the presentevidence, we do not.</p>
      <p>I conclude with a more generalremark,one that extends well beyond
Peltzman'sarticleto theoriesof regulationin
general."Functionalanalysis" involves the attributionof causalityto a practiceaftera showingof
its effects.l1A key partof pseudoscience, it is prominentin Marxism(X
is in the interest of capitalists; therefore, it exists because it is in the
interestof capitalist)and feminism(X is in the interestof men, therefore
it exists because it is in the interest of men). It is also prominentin
economics, includinginterest-grouptheory. Havingshownthata practice
is efficient,some people thinkthatthey have shownthatit exists because
it is efficient;having shown that a practice serves identifiableinterests,
some people think they have shown that it exists for that very reason.

      <p>1 It is well discussed in Jon Elster, Ulysses and the Sirens: Studies in Rationality and
Irrationality 28-35 (1979); Jon Elster, Explaining Technical Change, at ch. 2 (1983): Jon
Elster, Sour Grapes 101-8 (1983).</p>
      <p>Economistsand economicallyinclinedlawyershave become extremely
sophisticatedin revealing the effects of legal regulation.We might be
able to demonstrate, for example, that occupational safety and health
regulationis in the interest of large firms,or that regulationof new risks
(andexemptionof old ones) helps to cartelizeexistingindustry.But from
this it is often said to follow thatregulationexists because of its beneficial
effects on largefirmsor existing industry.I hope that I have said enough
to show that this does not follow. Often it is more than enough to be
able to demonstratethe social consequences of legal rules, withoutalso
claimingto have shown causation.'2</p>
      <p>12Of course, a demonstrationof effects may be relevantto the issue of causation;from
effects we can generateplausiblestories about contributingfactors. But there is a large
differencebetweenplausibilityandtruth.To assess the matterof truthaboutthe causes of
regulation,we need to knowa good deal morethaninterest-groupandpublicchoice theory
typicallyprovide.</p>
      <p>A relatedpoint:Sometimeseconomictheoriesof regulationappearinsufficientlyto
investigatethe possibilitythat the system precedingthe specificregulationat issue is itself the
productof self-interestedactionandthatthatspecificregulationis in some sense a counter
or a correctiveto an interest-drivenstatusquo. The lack of investigationhere has led to a
significantgap in the literature.It wouldbe exceptionallyinterestingto see whetherfailure
to regulateis sometimesattributableto interest-grouppower,or (less ambitiously)to show
thatthe absenceof regulationproducespredictablewinnersandlosers. See EinerElhague,
Does InterestGroupTheory Justify More IntrusiveJudicialReview? 101 Yale L. J. 31
(1991);Cass Sunstein,After the RightsRevolution2-3 (1990).The issue is not raisedby
Peltzman'sarticlehere, however, and hence I do not discuss it.</p>
