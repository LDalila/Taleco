        <p>Some people think that there is a deep opposition between
"government intervention" and "free markets." But the opposition is too
simple. No one is really opposed to "government intervention."
Markets depend for their existence on law, which is necessary to establish
property rights and to set out the rules governing contracts and tort.
Short of anarchy, a system of legal entitlements, set by the state, is
inevitable.1 If we are asking whether the state is an important part
of the solution to current social problems, there can be only one
answer: it had better be. But what is the relationship between the
state and social well-being?</p>
        <p>This question assumes special significance in light of the original
aspiration of the American founders - to create a deliberative
democracy.2 Public officials would be accountable to the citizenry at
large, but they were also supposed to engage in deliberative tasks,
and to profit from and to encourage deliberation among the people as
a whole. Both the structure of the national government and the
system of individual rights were intended to encourage public
deliberation.</p>
        <p>Things have not worked out as the Framers envisioned. One of
the most serious problems is the public emphasis on issues and events
that have little relevance to most people's lives. People lack accurate
information about what is most important.3 In elections, for example,
"soundbite politics" often replaces discussion about public issues.4 The
problem affects day-to-day governance too. Instead of focusing on,
for example, education and its improvement, public attention is often
directed to sensational anecdotes, crude oversimplifications of issues,

or scandals about public officials' private lives. In these
circumstances, we are likely to end up with misdirected policies or worse
a form of government by faction, the evil most feared by the American
founders.5 A high priority for those thinking about the role of the
state should be to develop methods for focusing attention on things
that matter to people's lives.</p>
        <p>An important part of this task is to establish criteria by which to
measure governmental performance. If broadly debated and
wellpublicized, such criteria should promote democratic discussion and at
the same time help to counteract the very problems to which they
draw attention. To develop criteria of this kind, we need a theory of
social well-being. To be helpful, the theory must be not only
substantively plausible but also practical to apply. This constraint is a
demanding one. The best substantive theory might well be abandoned
because it is not administrable - because the underlying data cannot
be compiled without great cost, because the theory does not allow
comparisons among regions or over time, or because it is too unruly
and complex.</p>
        <p>In the United States, there are many measures of economic
performance. But here and abroad, gross domestic product (GDP) is the
most influential indicator of social well-being. When GDP is growing,
it is often thought that a number of good things will happen
employment will increase, poverty will go down, and people will be
able to obtain a wide range of valuable things. Concentration on
GDP has important political effects. It focuses media, public, and
governmental attention in a distinctive way.</p>
        <p>Part of my goal here is to show - what most economists do not
deny - that GDP is an inadequate measure of social well-being, and
that we lack an adequate alternative. GDP is too crudely connected
to things that people should care about. To overcome the limits of
GDP, I offer a simple proposal: Democratic governments should
produce an annual "quality of life report," designed to measure their
performance in producing good lives for their citizens. This report
should be highly publicized and broadly disseminated. I also propose
that the ingredients in the report are plural and diverse. They are
not commensurable. Both the fact of incommensurability and the
general attack on GDP have some important consequences for law.</p>
        <p>I suggest as well that it is important to attend to the relationship
between legal provisions and the various ingredients of individual and
social well-being. Per capita GDP, for example, becomes more
important if money is both necessary and sufficient for the acquisition
of valuable things. We might ultimately be able to evaluate legal</p>

provisions by exploring their relationship to the various components
of individual and social well-being. A quality of life report would
help in initiating this project.</p>
        <p>In the course of the discussion, I offer a great deal of data about
social and economic trends within the United States. The failure to
identify the empirical dimensions of legal disputes is a continuing
weakness in the legal culture.6 While the facts identified by a "quality
of life" report will not dispose of strictly legal debates, they do have
implications for many legal controversies, especially those involving
the criminal justice system, race and sex equality, and government
regulation.</p>

      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-3">
        <title>A. In General</title>
        <p>One of the simplest measures of social and economic well-being,
used internationally and by many nations, is gross domestic product
(GDP). The term refers to the total quantity of goods and services
produced, weighted by their respective prices.7 Goods and services
that are not paid for are not included.</p>
        <p>GDP is highly influential in international comparisons. It also
plays a large role in the domestic sphere. To take a crude illustration,
consider the astonishing fact that the words "gross national product"8
appeared in I6,055 major news stories in the last two years - and
that the words "gross domestic product" appeared in 39,007 stories.9
It would be an absurd exaggeration to say that ordinary people
frequently talk about GDP or GNP.10 But the numbers for GDP affect
legislative deliberations, presidential judgments, media reports on the

regime for libel law in fact alters press behavior as compared with a negligence regime - and
whether the alterations lead to more or less information about public issues. In administrative
law, it is important to know whether stringent judicial review actually improves agency
performance.</p>

        <p>8 Gross national product (GNP) means GDP adjusted to measure the total income received
by the inhabitants of the country. It adds to GDP all interest, profits, dividends, and rents
coming into a country from abroad, and then subtracts all interest, profits, dividends, and rents
paid to people in other countries. See ECONOMIC INDICATORS HANDBOOK 59 (Arsen J. Darnay
ed., I992). In November, I99I, the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis
shifted emphasis from GNP to GDP. See id.</p>

A different measure would focus attention on different things.</p>

        <title>B. Criticisms</title>
        <p>Certainly GDP is a useful figure, for it bears a relationship to
important social goals. If we think of income as an all-purpose means
- as something that people want regardless of what else they want
- we might well attend to GDP. There are, however, a number of
problems with relying on GDP as a measure of well-being. Some of
these problems suggest that GDP is imperfect as a measure of purely
economic goals. Some of them suggest that important social, rather
than purely economic, variables are not reflected in GDP, though of
course it is artificial to distinguish the economic and the social.1"
i. GDP and Economic Well-Being. - GDP's ability to measure
economic well-being is doubtful for a number of reasons.</p>
        <p>(a) Distributional Issues. - If income is unequally distributed, a
high GDP may disguise the fact that many people are living bad or
even desperate lives. For example, the United States has the highest
per capita real GDP in the world. 12 But it also has a higher rate of
children living in poverty - one in five - than does any other
wealthy country in the world. The rate of children living in poverty
is double that of the industrialized nations taken as a whole and four
times that of Western Europe. 13 Nearly half of all black children in
the United States live in poverty.14</p>
        <p>(b) Excluded Goods and Services. - GDP does not include goods
and services that are free, including some that are plausibly connected
with economic well-being. For example, unpaid domestic labor is not
a part of GDP.15 Many environmental amenities, such as clean air
and water, are not reflected in GDP. The GDP figure thus fails
adequately to measure either the benefits of a healthy environment or
11 See A.C. PIGOU, THE ECONOMICS OF WELFARE I2 (4th ed. I962) ("[T]here is no guarantee
that the effects produced on the part of welfare that can be brought into relation with the
measuring-rod of money may not be cancelled by effects of a contrary kind brought about in
other parts, or aspects, of welfare; and, if this happens, the practical usefulness of our conclusions
is wholly destroyed. . The real objection then is, not that economic welfare is a bad index
of total welfare, but that an economic cause may affect non-economic welfare in ways that
cancel its effect on economic welfare.").</p>

the costs of its degradation.16 There are other gaps in what GDP
measures. It does not, for example, reflect changes in leisure time;
but it is clear that any increase in leisure is a gain. 17 Most generally,
a serious problem with GDP is that the figure excludes all social costs
and benefits that do not have prices.18</p>
        <p>(c) Unclear Correlations with Other Important Economic
Indicators. - GDP sometimes seems to be a general placeholder for a
number of indicators of economic well-being. But in fact, it may not
be closely correlated with some important indicators. Consider two
major social goals: reduction of poverty and of unemployment. Of
course GDP growth can be an important factor in counteracting both
unemployment and poverty, and nothing I say here is inconsistent
with this judgment. But it is also possible for GDP increases to be
accompanied by increases in unemployment and hence poverty (which
is closely correlated with unemployment); indeed, this phenomenon
has often happened.</p>
        <p>Economic growth is a function of productivity growth and
employment growth, where productivity is understood as GDP divided
by total employment. 19 Increases in productivity can contribute to an
increase in GDP, possibly without increasing employment levels at
all. For example, converting a plant to use industrial robots may
16 GNP needs to be modified to account for:
any depreciation of natural capital stocks, in the same way that net national income is
equal to gross national income less estimated depreciation on man-made capital. . [and]

disposal of materials and energy to the receiving environments.</p>

        <p>In I993, President Clinton directed the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic
Analysis to develop a new measure of GDP, one that incorporates the cost of pollution and the value
of environmental amenities. See ROBERT V. PERCIVAL, ALAN S. MILLER, CHRISTOPHER H.
SCHROEDER &amp; JAMES P. LEAPE, ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION 394 (Supp. 1993).</p>
        <p>17 In I952, Kuznets attempted to redefine GNP to take leisure into account. See Simon
Kuznets, Long-Term Changes in the National Income of the United States of America Since
I870, in INCOME &amp; WEALTH OF THE UNITED STATES: TRENDS AND STRUCTURE 29, 63-69
(Simon Kuznets ed., I952). Note also that a i968 study showed a spectacular gain in leisure
over the last century. See A.W. Sametz, Production of Goods and Services: The Measurement
of Economic Growth, in INDICATORS OF SOCIAL CHANGE 77, 83 (Eleanor B. Sheldon &amp; Wilbert
E. Moore eds., I968).</p>

raise production levels while eliminating the jobs of hundreds of
assembly workers. Increases in GDP may therefore fail to produce
increases in employment levels. Because poverty is well correlated
with unemployment, it follows too that when GDP goes up, poverty
may not go down..</p>
        <p>The following table shows changes in GDP, unemployment, and
poverty from I970 to the present. GDP growth rates are generally
correlated with changes in unemployment rates, particularly in
especially high and especially low GDP growth years. There are, however,
years in which the two figures are not correlated. For present
purposes, a key point is that GDP rates are far from identical to
unemployment and poverty rates. If we know what happens to GDP, we
do not necessarily know what happens to unemployment and poverty.

2. GDP and Social Well-Being. - Even if GDP has some virtues
as an indicator of economic welfare, it fails to capture important
aspects of social well-being.</p>
        <p>(a) Uncertain Relation to Valuable Things. - It is often thought
that GDP serves as a good proxy.for valuable things. But the
relationship between GDP and important social goals is far from clear.</p>
        <p>Consider, for example, the likelihood of subjection to violent crime.
Physical security is surely an important ingredient in well-being, but
it is at best indirectly reflected in GDP. Consider also the fact that
there is no inevitable connection between GDP and life expectancy.
Some countries have a relatively low GDP but long life expectancy
and low rates of infant mortality.21 Many countries have a high GDP
but do poorly in promoting longevity.22 Education is an important
part of a good life, whether or not educated people accumulate wealth;
but the association between education and GDP, while real, is crude.</p>
        <p>Certainly we can speculate, with some plausibility, that wealthy
people are less likely to commit crimes and better able to pay for
education, and that high social wealth can and will be devoted to
improving criminal law enforcement, life expectancy, and public
health. But what has been said thus far should show that the
connection between GDP and these other goods is unclear.</p>
        <p>(b) Dependence on Legal and Social Practices. - The most basic
point here is conceptual: The value of money depends on social and
21 See UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT I990
at 9, tbl. i.i (I990) [hereinafter HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT I990] (presenting information
on Sri Lanka, Jamaica, and Costa Rica). The level of childhood immunizations puts the United
States 2ISt in the world, tied with Pakistan and below India, Bulgaria, North Korea, Indonesia,
and Botswana. See Moseley, supra note I3, ? I, at 4.</p>
        <p>22 See HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT I990, supra note 2I, at 9, tbl. i.i. The points
discussed in the text are connected to a broader debate. Emphasizing some of the problems
with accounts inspired by utilitarianism, John Rawls proposes that judgments about well-being
might be made by reference to "primary goods." In his latest formulation, Rawls points to "a.
basic rights and liberties . . .; b. freedom of movement and free choice of occupation against
a background of diverse opportunities; c. powers and prerogatives of offices and positions of
responsibility in the political and economic institutions of the basic structure; d. income and
wealth; and finally, e. the social bases of self-respect." JOHN RAWLS, POLITICAL LIBERALISM
i8i (I993). This approach is in many respects a considerable improvement over utilitarian
accounts and those that rely on an aggregated figure representing the private willingness to pay.
In place of primary goods, Amartya Sen has suggested that a good measure of well-being should
focus on people's "capabilities" and "functionings." See AMARTYA SEN, INEQUALITY
REEXAMINED 79-84 (I993). The term "capabilities" refers to a person's capacity or opportunity to choose
among valuable activities or functionings. We might ask, for example, whether someone is able
to get access to food, medical care, shelter, education, political participation, and so forth, or
whether that person is able to avoid public and private violence, physical pain, and other forms
of suffering. Like the list of primary goods, the list of capabilities and functionings is
heterogeneous. Its chief advantage is that it enables us to focus on the question why such things as
wealth and income are valuable, that is, what they enable people to have and to be.
legal practices determining what money can be used to buy. If certain
exchanges are blocked - if money cannot be used to purchase
valuable things - per capita GDP becomes less important. Wealth is less
valuable when money cannot be used to buy votes or political power,
or education, or marriage, or self-respect. Similarly, the value of
money is reduced to the extent that it is unnecessary for someone to
have money to obtain important goods. If education, health care,
political power, and clean air are free, money is less valuable.23</p>
        <p>In short, the value of money is largely a function of the legal
regime. To understand the relationship between GDP and valuable
things, it is necessary to understand the set of legal entitlements
through which people are enabled to get, or are disabled from getting,
things of importance to their lives. It might then be possible to "map"
legal provisions onto the various ingredients of well-being.24
(c) Commensurability. - GDP is of course an aggregative
measure, and it is aggregative in a distinctive sense.25 GDP is not simply
an index of different values, created to allow ease of understanding
and comparison. Instead, it measures diverse items through the same
basic dimension of "value," defined by willingness to pay.</p>
        <p>This approach assumes commensurability in the sense that it acts
as if diverse goods can be assessed according to the same metric. This
form of valuation seems wrong because it ignores qualitative
differences among diverse social goods.26 Some things (like education and
health) have intrinsic as well as instrumental value; other things (like
cash) are simply for use. Intrinsically valuable things are themselves
valued in different ways.</p>
        <p>The problem with GDP is that because it is aggregative, it effaces
qualitative differences. For this reason it is a crude indicator of social
welfare and an unpromising foundation for democratic deliberation.
Suppose, for example, that we are told that if OSHA issues a certain
occupational safety regulation, GDP will be reduced by o.ooi%. To
23 Of course there may be harmful social effects from prohibiting the use of money as a
basis for exchange, or from providing goods for free. Both of these decisions may mean that
there is less wealth upon which to draw. But these are different matters.</p>
        <p>24 This is a generalization of the "entitlement approach" suggested in AMARTYA SEN,
POVERTY AND FAMINES 45-5 I (I980I).</p>
        <p>25 Economists and others critical of GNP have proposed a number of alternative measures.
William Nordhaus and James Tobin, two early critics, suggested that it would be better to
attempt to generate a "measure of economic welfare" (MEW). See William D. Nordhaus &amp;
James Tobin, Is Growth Obsolete?, in THE MEASUREMENT OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
PERFORMANCE 509, 512-I3 (Conference on Research in Income &amp; Wealth, Studies in Income &amp;
Wealth Vol. 38, Milton Moss ed., I973).</p>
        <p>A more recent measure is the Daly &amp; Cobb "index of sustainable economic welfare" (ISEW).
See HERMAN E. DALY &amp; JOHN B. COBB, JR., FOR THE COMMON GOOD 401-55 (I989).</p>
        <p>26 See ELIZABETH ANDERSON, VALUE IN ETHICS AND ECONOMICS 8-I6 (1993); Cass R.

make a sensible evaluation, we need to know a great deal more. To
what does this number refer? Does it include greater unemployment,
higher inflation, and the scaled-back production of important goods?
Does it mean more poverty? At least in principle, it would be much
better to have a highly disaggregated system for assessing the
qualitatively different goods at stake. People should be informed about
the diverse potential effects and make judgments on the basis of an
understanding of the qualitative differences. If all the relevant goods
are aligned along a single metric, they become less visible, or perhaps
invisible. 2 7</p>

        <p>GDP is hardly the only indicator of social welfare. In the United

approach is that the measures - offered in an endless and barely

number of people sixteen years of age or older who are actively seeking

27 The use of GNP creates other difficulties, but because these seem less fundamental and
in some ways more complex, I simply identify them here.</p>
        <p>(a) GNP depends on willingness to pay and thus on existing preferences for various social
goods. One could do much worse than to make assessments on the basis of existing preferences;
people's well-being is certainly connected with satisfaction of consumption choices. Existing
preferences are not, however, an adequate guide to social well-being, because they may depend
on unjust background conditions or on simple ignorance. See AMARTYA SEN, COMMODITIES
AND CAPABILITIES 48 (Professor Dr. P. Hennipman Lectures in Economics Vol. 7, I985).</p>
        <p>(b) As noted, GNP is an important method for making cross-national comparisons. But per
capita GNP is an inadequate comparative guide if there are large differences in conditions and
hence in needs. If distinctive needs are a product of local circumstances, GNP per capita will
be an inadequate proxy for well-being.</p>
        <p>(c) The existence of positional goods poses a problem for GNP. Positional goods are those
that are valuable because only a few people have them. Status symbols of various sorts,
including luxury automobiles, are examples. See Richard H. McAdams, Relative Preferences,
I02 YALE L.J. i, I8-I9 (I992). If GNP is growing partly because it includes a large number
of positional goods, it is not clear that welfare is growing as well.</p>

The poverty level emerged from the I96I plan of the Department
of Agriculture.35 Like judgments about unemployment, the judgment
about who is poor is far from a simple matter of fact.36 The I96I
estimate measured how much money was necessary to meet nutritional
requirements, and this amount was multiplied by three to determine
the total income necessary to meet all living expenses.37 Poverty
thresholds have been updated every year by taking into account the
consumer price index. Hence, the annual threshold for a family of
four was $3I69 in I964, $ii,6ii in I987, and $I3,924 in i99i.38</p>
        <p>The official measure of poverty does not include noncash income;
it therefore excludes "food stamps, Medicare and Medicaid, school
lunches, and subsidized rental housing."39

No official government statistics reveal the costs and benefits of
government regulation. Private estimates suggest that economic
regulation costs the economy about $46 billion annually, and that social
regulation (principally environmental controls) costs between $78
billion and $IO7 billion.47 The benefits of economic regulation appear
low, but the benefits of social regulation range between $42 billion
and $i8i billion.48 No one has fully explored the effects of regulation
on GDP. A I990 study suggested that between I973 and I985, the
GDP growth rate fell by o.I9 percentage points as a result of
environmental controls.49 This study does not, however, include the
health benefits of such controls, which probably lead to productivity
gains. There are significant disparities in regulatory policy, especially
with respect to expenditures per life saved:</p>

no democratic judgment about the ingredients of such key measures
as GDP, poverty, and unemployment. There is no effort to put some
or many of the indicators into a composite figure, to provide an

        <p>The United Nations makes what is probably the most influential
international effort to measure well-being, though there have been
illuminating efforts elsewhere. I summarize several methods here. A
key point is that alternative accounts often place a premium on health
and education as well as per capita income.</p>
        <p>i. Human Development Index. - The United Nations publishes
an annual Human Development Report in order to facilitate
comparative assessments of government performance.53</p>

      <title>I320 HARVARD LAW</title>
      <p>(a) Description. - The report ranks I73 countries and contains
comparative information on access to health services and safe water;
numbers of radios, telephones, and televisions; levels of child
immunization and malnutrition; public expenditures on education;
malefemale wage gaps; levels of homicide, rape, and drug crimes;
population per doctor; numbers of new AIDS cases; population growth;
energy consumption; pollution levels; and much more.</p>
      <p>The United Nations approach places particular emphasis on a
"human development index" (HDI). This figure is calculated on the
basis of longevity, knowledge, and income.54 "Longevity" is
determined on the basis of life expectancy at birth.55 "Knowledge" is
calculated by a formula based on adult literacy and mean years of
schooling, with literacy weighted twice as heavily as mean years of
schooling.56 To take account of the diminishing value of income, the
"income" ingredient is based on an adjustment of per capita GDP.57
The UN measurement weighs the three variables equally. What
follows is the ranking of the first twelve countries in the latest report:
The HDI compiles much valuable information and presents it in
a revealing way. For instance, the United States ranks first in both
per capita GDP and adjusted real GDP; it also ranks first in mean
years of schooling and in overall educational attainment. But it ranks

      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>AND THE STATE I32 I</title>
        <p>sixth overall. The reason is that life expectancy at birth stands at
75.9 years, for a ranking along that dimension of sixteenth.</p>
        <p>The UN report demonstrates that there is no necessary connection
between GDP and employment levels.59 Moreover, the performance
of some countries appears to be quite variable over time. Notably,
the literacy rate in the United States increased from a comparatively
low 96% in I985 to a very high 99% in i9go.60</p>
        <p>An intriguing question concerns the precise relationship among the
HDI's three variables of longevity, knowledge, and income. Some
countries with relatively high income ranks (including Algeria,
Namibia, and South Africa) have relatively low HDI ranks.61 Other
countries have HDI ranks that are well above their income ranks
(including China, Colombia, and Uruguay).62</p>
        <p>A key issue is whether significant variations exist among groups
within each country. In the United States, for example, whites,
standing alone, rank above Japan in HDI; if American whites lived alone
in their own country, it would rank first in the world.63 By contrast,
African-Americans rank 3ist, and Hispanics 35th.64 In addition, no
nation's HDI improves after being adjusted for sex inequalities, which
indicates that no nation provides as good lives for women as it does
for men.65 But there are important variations. For example, women's
wages are 88% of men's in France and 85% in Norway, but only 5I%
in Japan and 59% in the United States.66</p>
        <p>Many other questions involve comparative data not directly
reflected in the HDI's three principal variables. Between I980 and i986,
for example, there were only 3I drug crimes per ioo,ooo people per
year in Japan, 25 in Israel, and 38 in the Netherlands, compared with
225 in Canada, 234 in the United States, and 403 in Australia.67 The
reported rape rate in the United States is by far the highest - i i 8
per ioo,ooo women between I5 and 59.68 In Japan, the rate is only
5 per ioo,ooo, and in many countries it is somewhere between i8 and
59 For example, Canada had an unemployment rate in I990-9I of I0.2% despite a high per
capita GNP. See id. at 20I, tbl. 39. Notwithstanding its considerably lower per capita GNP,
Japan's unemployment rate was 2. I%. See id. Switzerland's unemployment rate of I.3% is the
lowest among industrialized nations, but its per capita GNP is slightly below that of the United
States, which has a 6.6% unemployment rate. See id.</p>

IOO,OOO, compared with I.5 for Japan and Sweden and somewhere
between 2 and 3 for Canada, Switzerland, Australia, Finland, Austria,
and New Zealand.70 It should not be surprising that the United States
has the highest rate of prisoners, 426 per ioo,ooo, compared with 94
in Canada, 54 in Switzerland, and 77 in the United Kingdom and in
Germany.7 1</p>
        <p>(b) Difficulties. - The HDI approach has important limitations.
Any "index" will be controversial, and the equal weighting of the three
variables seems somewhat arbitrary. In any case, the three variables
are interrelated. Income can "buy" good educational attainment and
also longevity; people who are poor tend to live shorter lives. So too,
people who are in good health and who are well-educated have a
better chance to make money. The use of the three variables is
controversial partly because of these complex interrelations.72</p>
        <p>The HDI is also insensitive to ethnic, racial, sex and regional
differences. If, for example, there are important differences between
men and women, people should know about this fact.73 It is also
possible for a country with a high HDI score to have a number of
people concentrated toward the bottom of the economic ladder and
facing desperate conditions.</p>
        <p>2. Alternatives. - Other nations, especially those in Scandinavia,
have implemented interesting alternatives to HDI. The Swedish
assessment of "standard of living" is more disaggregated and less
mathematical than the UN approach. The assessment takes account of
health and access to health care; education and skills; housing; security
of life and property (including freedom from crime); availability of
recreation and cultural resources; employment; income and wealth;
and political participation.74 Of special interest is the Swedish
rejection of unitary measures of well-being, and the insistence that
wellbeing is not to be measured in purely subjective terms.75 A key point
69 See id.
70 See id.
71 See id.</p>
        <p>72 In addition, there is a degree of crudeness in the choice of the three indicators. It might
make sense to include poverty level, access to food, employment figures, and more. Moreover,
educational attainment is not adequately measured by mean years of schooling. Literacy is a
form of educational attainment, but it sets a low floor, and in any case it is far from clear that,
in assessing educational attainment, we should count literacy for two and mean years for one
in some aggregate figure. Perhaps a composite figure could be developed on the basis of a more
precise inquiry into relevant factors. Cf. PARTHA DASGUPTA, AN INQUIRY INTO WELL-BEING
AND DESTITUTION 77-78 (I993) (noting the absence of attention to civil and political liberties
in conventional measures of well-being, such as the HDI).</p>
        <p>73 The report does, however, try to take distribution into account by using adjusted tables.
See HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT I993, supra note I2, at I7, tbl. I.4.</p>
        <p>74 See Robert Erikson, Descriptions of Inequality: The Swedish Approach to Welfare
Research, in THE QUALITY OF LIFE 67, tbl. I (Martha C. Nussbaum &amp; Amartya Sen eds., I992).

        <title>THE STATE I323</title>
        <p>here is that people may adjust their expectations in light of a status
quo characterized by deprivation and injustice, and for this reason it
is important to see what people can have or become, not merely what
they think about their situation.</p>
        <p>Another interesting alternative is a comparative survey of
Scandinavian countries, initiated by the University of Helsinki.76 In
addition to the Swedish factors, the Finnish approach emphasizes the
quality of the biological and physical environment, including air and
water pollution; the nature of relations with other people in the local
community, in the family, and within the workplace; and opportunities
to enjoy nature. 7 7 The comparative survey is intended to include both
objective and subjective indicators of welfare.</p>
        <p>In the same vein, UNICEF lists a wide range of basic indicators,
without attempting to aggregate them. These include male and female
adult literacy rates; life expectancy at birth; income shares of the
lowest 40% and the highest 20% of the population; GDP per capita;
and infant mortality.78 The Netherlands identifies sixteen variables
involving quality of life: three each involving housing, health,
spending power, leisure, and employment, combined with a single variable
for education. 79 There is also an effort to combine these statistics into
an aggregate number showing changes over time for different groups
in the population.80 An organization in Washington, D.C. attempts
to measure human suffering through a scale that takes account of
income, inflation, infant mortality, nutrition, access to clean water,
literacy, and personal freedom.81 Similar aggregative and separate
statistics might be offered for human rights violations.82</p>

and space, and to ensure that the relevant reports are widely
disseminated.</p>
        <p>The American government should compile an annual "quality of
life" report. I cannot give a full account of the appropriate ingredients
of such a report. But it seems clear that the report should include,
among other things, per capita income, poverty, housing,
unemployment, average weekly earnings, inflation, child mortality, longevity,
subjection to violent crime, literacy, and educational attainment. The
report should also specify minimum standards for such things as
income, education, health, and housing. The report should allow for
comparison across regions, between men and women, and among
different racial and ethnic groups.</p>
        <p>These comparisons may spur healthy competition to do well along
dimensions that count. If a state knows that it ranks forty-second in,
say, unemployment, there will be both local and national pressure to
make things better. If a state has an especially high level of violent
crime, perhaps priorities can be changed to redress the problem. And
if women are doing much worse than men, or blacks much worse
than whites, the public can see this fact and perhaps take corrective
action.</p>
        <p>The quality of life report should be widely disseminated to the
public and, in particular, to the news media. Strong evidence
indicates that the media can play a large role in counteracting social
problems by focusing public and private attention and by giving
government the incentives to respond.83 Instead of attending to
anecdotes and sensational scandals - or offering statements about
supposed trends - the news media should focus on the quality of life
report and thus allow debate to be based on actual evidence. The
report may well have an especially important role during elections,
but it could affect deliberation and policymaking more broadly as
well.</p>
        <p>A quality of life report of the kind proposed here could produce
two distinct benefits. First, the report may well have desirable social
consequences by facilitating priority-setting, imposing appropriate
incentives on governmental officials, and fueling public interest in
redressing serious problems. Accurate and widely disseminated
information can be an important check on governmental failure to redress
such problems.84 Consider the striking fact that in modern times, no

the important role of news media in combatting famines).</p>
        <p>84 See id.; see also Amartya Sen, Freedoms and Needs, THE NEW REPUBLIC, Jan. IO &amp; I7,
I994, at 3I, 33-34 (emphasizing the importance of free expression and the press to a
government's willingness to address human suffering).</p>

        <title>THE STATE I325</title>
        <p>country with an active, free, and democratic press appears to have
suffered from famine.85</p>
        <p>Second, the very process of compiling a quality of life report would
have advantages. We have seen that any conception of what matters
is a product of judgments that may be controversial. Human needs
have a great deal to do with the facts - do people have jobs? do
they have food or housing? - but they are not simply facts. Any
conception of needs is a product of human judgments about what
matters. Consider, for example, the very definitions of poverty and
unemployment, or the decision whether to include comparative data
about groups defined in racial, ethnic, and religious terms. The public
understanding of social problems should itself be a product, at least
in part, of a good process of social deliberation about how needs are
best characterized.86 By using GDP as the central indicator of social
welfare while publishing a wide array of unorganized and somewhat
random indicators, the current system offers no such educational
benefits.</p>
        <p>To say all this is not to suggest that such a report would be simple,
or that it would not create risks. But most of the information is now
compiled and available somewhere; its systematic presentation and
dissemination should not be costly. There is of course a risk of error
and bias, especially in view of the fact that the fortunes of an
incumbent administration may depend on what emerges. Government
manipulation of official statistics is hardly foreign to American
experience. At the same time, many government agencies have established
a reputation for objectivity, and there is no reason to believe that (for
example) the statistics relating to literacy, infant mortality, and
poverty levels reflect substantial bias.</p>
        <p>To be sure, people have limited information-processing capacities,
and these can lead to systematic errors through the use of bad
heuristics. Some release of information can actually make things worse.
But to some extent the confusion is a result of what has been made
public, and careful presentation of the data should help overcome
some of the faulty heuristics. One of the most common heuristics, for
example, is that of "availability."87 People seem to think that events
are more probable if an occurrence can easily be brought to mind.
85 See Sen, supra note 84, at 34.
86 See id. at 32. Sen writes:
Political rights can have a major role in providing incentives and information toward the
solution of economic privation. But the connections between rights and needs are not
merely instrumental; they are also constitutive. For our conceptualization of economic
needs depends on open public debates and discussions, and the guaranteeing of those
debates and those discussions requires an insistence on political rights.</p>

I326 HARVARD LAW
Some of this effect might be counteracted by a report that catalogues
a range of events, that allows comparisons, and that shows changes
over time. The very need to compile the data would also give
desirable incentives to government officials.88</p>
        <p>I have suggested that both personal and social well-being are in
important respects a product of law; that is, they are a function of
the things to which the law gives people access. The law can give
such access in many ways. It may provide guarantees of certain goods
(such as housing, food, medical care); it may allow people to sell their
labor; it may permit people to own certain things that they produce
or inherit; and it may say that people can freely exchange some, but
not all, of what they own. People's entitlements are a function of
law, and it is their entitlements that enable them to obtain much of
what provides for their well-being. We lack a systematic account of
the relationship between legal entitlements and the components of
well-being.</p>
        <p>These points have general implications. A homeless person, for
example, is deprived of shelter in important part through the law; if
he tries to sleep in a place with a roof, the law will call him a
trespasser and subject him to civil and criminal penalties.89 Whether
someone has access to medical care depends on the bundle of legal
rights that have been conferred. Property rights as we know them
are not brute or natural facts, but a product of laws granting and
conditioning entitlements of different kinds.90 It should ultimately be
possible to link various coniponents of well-being to different legal
permissions and requirements. We could begin to connect
deprivations and benefits of various sorts with a range of legal provisions. A
quality of life report would help initiate this endeavor.</p>
        <p>Of course, no report can substitute for actual reform. What
matters is what is done, not what is said. But in some contexts, what is
done is a function of what is said. In the area of risk regulation, for
example, there is evidence that disclosure of information can be an
important regulatory tool, prompting corrective action by employers,
employees, and governments generally.91 In any case, both citizens
88 A similar report should be compiled in other nations and be made available for
international comparison and review. See Cass R. Sunstein, Information, Please, 2 E. EUR. CONST.
REV. 54, 54 (I993).</p>
        <p>89 See Jeremy Waldron, Homelessness and the Issue of Freedom, 39 UCLA L. REV. 295,
304 (I99I).</p>
        <p>90 Amartya Sen writes:
Finally, the focus on entitlement has the effect of emphasizing legal rights. Other relevant
factors, for example market forces, can be seen as operating through a system of legal
relations (ownership rights, contractual obligations, legal exchanges, etc.). The law stands
between food availability and food entitlement. Starvation deaths can reflect legality
with a vengeance.</p>

        <p>91 See WESLEY A. MAGAT &amp; W. KiP Viscusi, INFORMATIONAL APPROACHES TO
REGULAand public officials are unlikely to know what to do unless they have
good information about existing problems and trends. These points
have general and complex consequences for the study of law, but I
end with a simple claim: Democratic governments could take few
more important steps than to initiate a process by which the
components of well-being would become a substantial part of political
debate.</p>
