        <p>congressionalprogramsfaithfully and effectively has called into question the
wisdom of the central institutionalinnovations of the New Deal: the
expansion of the regulatory state and the shift in power from the states to the
federal government. In this Article, Professor Sunstein challenges the New
Deal morefundamentally, examining not only the institutionalchanges
themselves, but also the shift in constitutional commitments that underlay those
reforms. Professor Sunstein identifies three aspects of New Deal
constitutionalism: the rejection of the original constitutionalcommitment to checks
and balances in favor of independent and insulated regulatory
administration, the recognition of substantive entitlements beyond those protected at
common law, and the abandonment of principles of federalism that vested
regulatory authority in both thefederal government and the states. Professor
Sunstein argues that many of the presentfailures of regulatory administration
- particularlythe problems of agency capture and factionalism - can be
traced to the New Deal's failure to incorporate the original constitutional
commitment to checks and balances into regulatory administration. The
remedy, he suggests, is to reinvigorate the commitment to checks and balances
through a system of coordinated review of agency action that includes a
strong supervisory role for each of the three branches of government - the
executive, the judiciary, and Congress. In addition, Professor Sunstein
maintains that the protection of new entitlements during the New Deal was
a natural andjustified outgrowth of the recognition by New Deal reformers
that the common law itself favors some social interests over others. He
suggests that this substantive aspect of the New Deal should be incorporated
into modern public law, in which common law categoriespersist despite the
insights of New Deal reformers. Finally, Professor Sunstein argues that the
third aspect of New Deal constitutionalism - the emphasis on national
rather than local control of regulatory issues - has been carried too far,
depriving citizens of the opportunity to participatemeaningfully in the debate
over the terms of their social life.</p>

crease in presidential power, and the creation of a massive
bureaucracy concentrated in the executive branch, have augmented factional
power and self-interested representation, often leading to regulation
that fails to serve the interests of the public at large. In significant
ways, the federal government both overregulates and underregulates.
The failure of national institutions to intervene or to exercise restraint
is not simply the product of the poor judgment of key government
officials or the triumph of a particular political agenda. Much of the
failure of public regulation over the past half-century reflects the
inadequacy of important aspects of the constitutional vision embraced
by the New Deal. Institutional reform is thus a major part of the
agenda of modern public law.</p>

          <title>A. New Deal Constitutionalism</title>
          <p>The regulatory system established during the New Deal' has failed
to fulfill its original promise. In the New Deal period, reformers
believed that administrative officials would serve as independent,
selfstarting, technically expert, and apolitical agents of change. This
basic understanding wedded the original constitutional belief in the
need for an energetic national government 2 to the desire, associated
with the Progressive movement, 3 to insulate public officials from
par' The initial period of growth for the regulatory agency came before the New Deal, during
the latter part of the 19th century and the first two decades of this century. See generally S.
SKOWRONEK, BUILDING A NEW AMERICAN STATE: THE EXPANSION OF NATIONAL
ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITIES, I877-1920 (z982) (surveying the early development of the modern
administrative state). It is important to emphasize as well that the New Deal was far from monolithic.
There were competing strands and several different periods of experimentation, with different
emphases. For all its novelty, the New Deal was not an altogether sudden break; it should
instead be understood as the culmination of a set of ideas with much earlier foundations. See
generally id.; W. WILSON, CONGRESSIONAL GOVERNMENT: A STUDY IN AMERICAN POLITICS

leadership of the Executive"); W. WILSON, CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT IN THE UNITED

dominant features. For discussion of the period, see generally P. CONKIN, THE NEW DEAL (2d

tisan pressures in the service of a long-term public interest. The
concept of autonomous administration, now under sharp attack, was
originally the source of enormous optimism about possible reformation
of the system of checks and balances. The New Dealers believed that
institutional changes were necessary to allow the federal government
to deal with the multiple social and economic issues that arose in the
wake of the Depression.</p>
          <p>The institutional program of the New Deal was one element of a
three-part critique of the traditional constitutional framework. The
first criticism, substantive in character, was the culmination of a long
period of rethinking both of that framework and of the system of
common law ordering. For the New Deal reformers, the common law
was neither natural nor prepolitical. Instead, it embodied a particular
social theory, serving some interests at the expense of others. 4 In
particular, the New Dealers viewed the common law as a mechanism
for insulating the existing distribution of wealth and entitlements from
collective control. The common law catalog of rights included both
too much and too little - excessive protection of established property
interests and insufficient protection of the interests of the poor, the
elderly, and the unemployed. Hence the New Deal reformers called
for substantial changes that would recognize new interests as
entitlements and redistribute resources.5 Most dramatically, President
Franklin Roosevelt urged a "second Bill of Rights," available to all
"regardless of station, race, or creed," and including:</p>

AND THE THRESHOLD OF PEACE, 1944-45, at 41 (1950). President Roosevelt described the</p>
      <p>The second element of the New Deal critique focused on the
institutional system of tripartite government and checks and balances.
The New Deal reformers believed that the original constitutional
structure, like the common law, was closely associated with protection
of the existing distribution of wealth and entitlements. In their view,
the system of separated functions prevented the government from
reacting flexibly and rapidly to stabilize the economy and to protect
the disadvantaged from fluctuations in the unmanaged market. 7 In
addition, the New Deal reformers believed that the distribution of
powers among the three branches of government created political
struggles that disabled officials in the executive branch from making
regulatory policies free of partisan pressure.</p>
      <p>Although the most radical attacks on tripartite government failed,
some of the impulses behind those attacks paved the way for both
enhanced presidential authority and the rise of regulatory
administration. 8 The newly created agencies, largely a creature of the New
Deal, 9 combined traditionally separated functions and remained free
of direct control from Congress, the federal judiciary, and sometimes
origin of the term "New Deal" in this way:</p>
      <p>The word "Deal" implied that the government itself was going to use affirmative
action to bring about its avowed objectives rather than stand by and hope that general
economic laws alone would attain them. The word "New" implied that a new order of
things designed to benefit the great mass of our farmers, workers and business men would
replace the old order of special privilege in a Nation which was completely and thoroughly
disgusted with the existing dispensation.</p>

      <p>9 Although administrative agencies have been a part of government since the founding of
the republic, the modern regulatory agency is a recent phenomenon. The Interstate Commerce
Commission was created in 1887, and the Federal Trade Commission in 1914, but it was not
until the New Deal that the modern agency became a pervasive feature of American government.
Eleven agencies were created between the framing of the Constitution and the close of the Civil
War; six were created from i865 to the turn of the century; nine agencies date from 19oo to
the end of World War I; nine more were created between 1918 and the Depression in 1929; and
no fewer than 17 were created in the decade between 193o and 1940. See ATTORNEY GENERAL'S
COMMITTEE ON ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE, FINAL REPORT 7-I1 (1941) [hereinafter
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S COMMITTEE]. These New Deal agencies included the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Social Security Board, the National Labor Relations Board, the Commodity
Exchange Commission, the Railroad Retirement Board, the Wage and Hour Division of the
Department of Labor, and the Selective Service Administration. See id. at io-ii. In addition,
of course, new duties were conferred on established entities during this period.
even the President.' 0 The institutional critique of the period, pointing
to the need for entities not burdened by tripartite government,
naturally accompanied the New Deal's substantive program."</p>
      <p>The third element in the New Deal critique, also institutional,
produced a massive shift in the relationship between the federal
government and the states. Interdependencies in the economy, a central
revelation of the Depression, made it increasingly difficult for
reformers to believe that states could solve social and economic problems on
their own. Competition among the states sometimes produced
paralysis; many problems called for a uniform national remedy. States
often seemed to be arenas for factional strife and parochialism. 12
Moreover, the size of state government and the dominance of
wellorganized private groups within the states made it difficult to credit
the traditional belief that local self-determination could genuinely be
achieved by state autonomy. In these circumstances, the call for a
dramatic increase in the exercise of federal regulatory power seemed
quite natural.</p>
      <p>In the New Deal period, the original constitutional framework was
thus reformulated in three fundamental ways. The New Deal set out
a different conception of legal rights, rejecting common law and status
quo baselines for deciding what constituted governmental "action" and
"inaction"; it proposed a dramatically different conception of the
presidency and a novel set of administrative actors; and it rejected
traditional notions of federalism. The term "New Deal constitutionalism"
describes the resulting structure.</p>

        <title>B. Current Controversies</title>
        <p>Although the reformers of the 1930's were largely successful in
changing both legal entitlements and institutional forms, American
nublic law has not entirely come to terms with New Deal
constitutionalism, and many current controversies reflect ambivalence about
its legacy. Some of modern public law, for example, is built directly
on common law or status quo baselines. For example, rights to a
hearing, 13 to an article III tribunal, 14 and to judicial review of agency
action' 5 -are powerfully influenced by common law categories; the
10 See infra pp. 444-45. The degree to which agencies were intended to be or have in fact
been immune from presidential control is subject to dispute. See id.; infra note 352.</p>

courts to regulate economic activity); Hale, Coercion and Distribution in a Supposedly

existence of a right protected at common law is highly relevant in all
three areas. One of the greatest ironies of modern administrative law
- an area whose origins lay in a substantial repudiation of the
common law - is its continuing reliance on common law categories.</p>
        <p>The institutional issues are in a similar state of flux. Over the last
three decades, autonomous administration has come under pressure
from a variety of directions. In a number of statutes enacted since
I96O, Congress has attempted to limit administrative discretion
through timetables, deadlines, and clear instructions about
implementation. In the i96O's and 1970's, the courts became increasingly
aggressive in reviewing administrative activity. Since 1970, the
President has sought to impose greater control. There has also been a
resurgence of doubt about the constitutional status of agencies that
are "independent" of presidential control. In all of these areas,
traditional checks and balances have been reinvigorated in an effort to
police the administrative process and to restore electoral
accountability. Current failures of regulatory agencies have thus undermined the
institutional learning of the New Deal during a period in which the
New Deal skepticism about "limited government" remains for the most
part intact, at least in the context of social regulation. 16</p>
        <p>Recent efforts to impose judicial and executive checks on the
regulatory process have been especially controversial. In light of the
ideological tension between the President and the judiciary during the
Reagan Administration, it should perhaps be unsurprising that those
who favor an active judicial role tend to oppose the exercise of
presidential authority 17 and that those favorably disposed toward
presi16 President Reagan, for example, has not fundamentally altered the regulatory state. During
his first term, he spoke approvingly of the "social safety net," and his intrusions on spending
and regulatory measures were not intended to eliminate minimum floors. See generally

ADMINISTRATION (J. Weicher ed. 1984) (examining changes in income security and redistribution
programs during Reagan's first term).</p>

dential authority are skeptical about the supervisory role of the federal
courts. 18 But the disagreement between advocates of presidential
control and advocates of judicial power is undergirded not only by
divergent views about how much social and economic regulation is
desirable, but also by disagreement over the respective roles of politics,
law, and technical expertise in the regulatory process. 19 The
advocates of a strong judicial role generally embrace a technocratic
conception of regulation - also associated with the New Deal - in
which immersion in the law and facts leads to uniquely correct
solutions, or at least to a sharply restricted range of acceptable outcomes. 20
In a curious reversal of the New Deal understanding that technocratic
rationality precludes judicial control, some observers maintain that
the courts should play an important role in regulation - to ensure
"legality" and to prevent factionalism - and that the role of the
President is secondary. 2 1
        </p>
        <p>The advocates of presidential control are deeply skeptical of this
conclusion. For them, regulatory issues are above all "political."
Here, as elsewhere, the precise meaning of the term "political" is not
always clear, but the central ideas are that regulation poses issues of
values and not of facts, and that the relevant values should be
implemented by those accountable to the public. In addition,
presidential control is said to promote technocratic rationality. 2 2 It follows
igo-gi. Courts have also reviewed administrative inaction and sometimes compelled
administrative action. See, e.g., Doyle v. Brock, 821 F.2d 778, 783-87 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (invalidating
a decision by the Secretary of Labor not to challenge a union election procedure); NAACP v.

that the President should play a critical role in regulation, and that
the courts should do very little.</p>
        <p>Controversies over clear congressional instructions to agencies
often turn on similar disputes about the relationship between the
political and technocratic features of regulation. Advocates of
congressional specificity point to the risk of regulatory failure and the
advantages of the legislative process in terms of visibility and
accountability. 23 Critics contend that Congress is itself beset by factionalism 24
and that a measure of agency autonomy is necessary to ensure
flexibility and specialization in the matter at hand. In all of these areas,
the debate over the regulatory process has refocused attention on the
nature of tripartite government in an era of positive regulation.</p>
        <p>Finally, efforts have been made to achieve some of the goals
associated with the original federal structure. Proposals for increasing
state autonomy, promoting local self-determination, and achieving
economic democracy recall the roots of the Constitution in principles of
civic republicanism. 25 At least for some, the goals of such proposals
are to find a realm for active citizen participation in deciding the
terms of social life, to promote flexibility and diversity, and to ensure
that political outcomes result from civic virtue and deliberation rather
than from self-interest and bargaining.</p>
        <p>The principal purpose of this Article is to describe the relationship
between the original constitutional structure and the New Deal
reformation and to outline some of the lessons of the last half-century
for dilemmas in modern public law. The Article suggests that the
New Deal's substantive critique was largely correct; indeed, in some
ways it did not go far enough. 26 An important task for the future is
therefore to generate a new set of entitlements to accompany the
development of public law. On the other hand, the institutional
framework of the New Deal was largely a mistake - an unnecessary
and in some ways counterproductive means of achieving its own
substantive program. Even if the institutional goal of insulating
officials from constituents is grounded in established features of

institutional innovations of the New Deal. Administrative agencies have
failed to serve as vehicles for democratic aspirations, and the
regulatory regimes they have designed have often been unsuccessful.</p>

pathologies of the current institutions and to consider new initiatives. Such
strategies must of course recognize the need for regulatory agencies
that can provide both flexibility over time and specialization in the
subject at hand. But in the wake of the abandonment of the New
Deal vision of independent administration, the best alternative is to
develop a system of aggressive legislative, judicial, and executive
control - a system in which the three institutions bring about
something close to the safeguards of the original constitutional framework
without retreating to anachronistic understandings of "limited
government." Such a system, accompanied by a reformulated network of
rights and strengthened federalism, will promote those aspects of New
Deal constitutionalism that have the strongest claim to contemporary
support.</p>
        <p>I propose a number of reforms to accomplish these goals. These
include (i) increased presidential supervision of the executive agencies,
accompanied by various safeguards; (2) reformulation of executive
control to include the power and responsibility to encourage the
undertaking of regulatory initiatives - to some degree on the
ombudsman model28 - as well as the authority to discourage unnecessary or
counterproductive proposals; (3) continuation of a moderately
aggressive role for the federal judiciary; (4) development of a greater role
for Congress in agency administration, through specifications of
regulatory ends, deadlines, and various sorts of oversight; (5) reduction
of statutes that identify the means by which agencies are to accomplish
statutory goals; (6) inclusion of independent agencies within the
supervisory authority of the President; (7) revision of the system of rights
to extend the New Deal abandonment of common law and status quo
baselines; (8) reformulation of administrative law doctrines to place
regulatory beneficiaries on the same plane as regulated entities; and
(9) a departure from the national focus of the New Deal to a system
that increases opportunities for local self-determination and democratic
participation.</p>
        <p>This Article is organized as follows. Part II describes the
relationship between limited government and the traditional distribution of
national powers; it also explores the ways in which New Deal

institutional critique and in its opposition to limited government. Part III

describes and evaluates changing attitudes of the President, the courts,
and Congress toward the administrative process, suggesting that
because of the various intrusions on agency autonomy, traditional
conceptions of administration have become anachronistic. Part III also
addresses the relationships among the various forms of control and
discusses the constitutional attack on independent agencies, relating
that attack to the declining faith in New Deal administration. Part
I argues in favor of a revised system of checks and balances, adapted
for a period of active governmental regulation of the economy. Part
IV discusses the reformulation of rights during the New Deal period,
substantive regulatory reform, and the question of local
self-determination.</p>

      <title>I. THE NEW DEAL REFORMATION</title>
      <sec id="sec-5-1">
        <title>A. The Distributionof National Powers: Underlying Functions</title>
        <p>The New Deal was a self-conscious revision of the original
constitutional arrangement of checks and balances, and some of the
problems of modern regulation are a product of the myopic reaction of the
New Deal reformers to the system of separated and divided powers.
New Deal constitutionalism must therefore be understood against the
backdrop of the traditional framework. It is necessary at the outset
to note that the notion of separation of powers is in important respects
a mis characterization of the constitutional system, which should
instead be understood in terms of checks and balances. 2 9 The three
branches of course have overlapping functions; each is involved to
some degree in the activities of the other.30 The term "separation"
tends to disguise this fact.</p>
        <p>The distribution of national powers was powerfully influenced by
the Madisonian revision of classical republican thought and in
particular by the Madisoiian conception of representation. 3 1 In Madison's
framework, the central danger for a political system lay in factionalism
- the usurpation of governmental power by well-organized private
29 See F. McDONALD, Novus ORDO SECLORUM 258 (1985) ("The doctrine of the separation
of powers had clearly been abandoned in the framing of the Constitution; as Madison explained
in Federalist numbers 47-51, mixing powers was necessary to ensure a system of checks and
balances.").</p>
        <p>30 Examples of overlapping control include the President's role in lawmaking, most
prominently the presentment clause; the power of Congress to advise and consent to presidential
appointments; the power of Congress to vest the appointment authority in the President alone,
department heads, or courts; judicial review; and the mixed roles of Congress and the President
in the area of foreign affairs.</p>
        <p>31 See D. EPSTEIN, THE POLITICAL THEORY OF THE FEDERALIST 93-99 (1984) (discussing
Madison's view of the duty of representatives to promote the public good).
groups with interests adverse to those of the public as a whole. 32
Madison believed that politics should not consist of a series of
unprincipled trade-offs among self-interested factions. The process
should instead have a significant component of deliberation and
dialogue about the public good. As Madison saw it, however, experience
had shown that the classical republican belief in small-scale
democracy, calling for active citizen participation 33 in government, was
unrealistic and counterproductive. 3 4 In view of the self-interested
character of citizen behavior, efforts to promote decisions by the
citizenry at large would produce factional warfare. 35 Widespread citizen
participation therefore would not serve the traditional republican
belief in deliberative government.</p>
        <p>Madison's solution dramatically revised traditional republican
thought.3 6 For classical republicans, only a small republic with direct
self-rule could produce and benefit from a virtuous citizenry.3 7
Madison turned this understanding on its head. In his view, it was a large
republic, with comparatively insulated representatives, that would be
uniquely able to produce a well-functioning deliberative democracy.
A small republic would be torn by factional warfare; in a large one,
by contrast, representatives would be able to escape the pressures of
powerful groups and engage in the deliberative tasks of politics. It
was therefore necessary to place decisions in the hands of
representatives chosen from a large territory, "whose wisdom may best discern
the true interest of their country and whose patriotism and love of
justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial
considerations. '38 In this respect, there is a Burkean strand in Madison's
theory of representation. 3 9 Madison abandoned the classical
republican belief in direct self-rule by the citizenry 40 without rejecting the
underlying republican faith in deliberative democracy. Of course, the
framers set out other safeguards as well, including federalism and a
measure of political accountability, achieved through direct election
of the House of Representatives and through electoral control of other
institutions.</p>
        <p>The distribution of national powers served two principal
purposes. 4 1 The first was efficiency, brought about by a sensible division
of labor. Often the separation of powers is thought to confine
authority, but in some respects it increases and liberates it. For example,
a central defect of the Articles of Confederation was its failure to
provide for a strong executive. The framers, responding to this
failure, created an executive branch designed to promote energetic and
consistent governance. 4 2</p>
        <p>The goal of governmental efficiency was also promoted by the
coordination of executive action, which was to be achieved through
the creation of a unitary executive branch. 43 The framers rejected a
"plural executive" on the ground that the fragmentation of power
would make expeditious action impossible, attenuate accountability,
and prevent coordination and centralization of policy. 44 Hence
executive power was vested in the President alone.4 5 The division of power
between the executive and the judiciary also served to free the
executive from responsibility for decisions that all or parts of the citizenry
might disapprove. By conferring adjudicative functions on a separate
institution, the framers ensured that the executive would not be held
responsible for decisions unfavorable to particular factions. 4 6</p>
        <p>Even though the distribution of national powers can be understood
as an efficient division of labor, the best-known justification for the
distribution is the need to diminish the risk of tyranny. Even as
Madison extolled the value of a large republic in promoting
publicspirited representation, he recognized that "enlightened statesmen will
not always be at the helm." 47 The distribution of national powers
was designed to check unenlightened or self-interested representatives.
Above all, it diffused governmental power, reducing the likelihood
that any branch would be able to use its power against all or parts
of the citizenry. The system of checks and balances allowed each
branch - armed with its own ambitions - to attempt to counter the
other. 48 In these respects, checks and balances fit comfortably into a
system in which dangers were thought to lie principally in
governmental action rather than failure to act.</p>
        <p>In view of this history, it should not be surprising that the New
Deal reformers associated the system of checks and balances with
governmental inaction. This association prompted advocates of
governmental intervention to seek a substantial reformation of the original
distribution of national powers. The reformation has been only partly
successful, however, and many of its failings recall the purposes
underlying the original system of checks and balances. It is therefore
45 See Flaumenhaft, supra note 42, at 70-71, 74; id. at 70 (arguing that in the Hamiltonian
system of energetic national government, "[o]nly replacing the vestiges of democratic participation
by an efficacious administrative system could supply the energy to protect [Americans] against
turmoil and invasion and the energy to manage their prosperity," and stating that "[t]he rejection
of classical politics culminates in the politics of administration"). This understanding fits
comfortably with Madison's theory of representation; it also presages the New Deal. See 'infra pp.
441-42.</p>
        <p>46 See Holmes, Precommitmentand the ParadoxofDemocracy, in CONSTITUTIONALISM AND
DEMOCRACY (J. Elster &amp; A. Slagstad eds. forthcoming 1988).</p>
        <p>47 THE: FEDERALIST No. io, at 58 (J. Madison) (C. Van Doren ed. 1945).</p>
        <p>48 This justification appears in THE FEDERALIST No. 47 (J. Madison) (C. Van Doren ed.
1945): "The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary in the same hands,
whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed,. or elective, may justly
be pronounced the very definition of tyranny." Id. at 322. This basic theme can also be found
in Justice Brandeis' celebrated suggestion that the "doctrine of the separation of powers was
adopted by the Convention of 1787, not to promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise of
arbitrary power. The purpose was, not to avoid friction, but, by means of the inevitable friction
incident to the distribution of the governmental powers among three departments, to save the
people from autocracy." Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 293 (1926) (Brandeis, J.,
dissenting).
necessary to explore the ways in which the distribution of national
1owers operates as a safeguard against tyranny. The framers
emphasized several considerations; most are highly relevant to current
institutional dilemmas.</p>
        <p>r. The Rule of Law. - The distinction between the legislature and
the executive ensures that the power to execute the law is not in the
hands of those who make it. Because legislators are unable to exempt
themselves from law execution, they must, in enacting laws, take the
perspective of ordinary citizens subject to the force of the law. Thus
"[i]f a separate executive will enforce the law even against the
lawmakers, the lawmakers will not have a 'distinct interest from the rest
of the Community." 49 In this way, the distribution of national powers
promotes generality in lawmaking - a fundamental constitutional
value.</p>
        <p>2. Rulers Versus Ruled. - A related but more general justification
stresses the desire to ensure that government officials will not act in
their own interests, but in the interest of the public as a whole. The
concern that rulers might have independent interests, and use them
to oppress the public, played an important role in the framing of the
Constitution.50 The term "self-interested representation" describes the
phenomenon of representatives seeking to promote their own
interests. 5' If authority were concentrated in one branch, that branch
would be more likely and able to increase its own power at the expense
of the governed. By allowing each branch to check the others, the
distribution of national powers was intended to act as a partial
solution to this problem, increasing democratic control over
representatives and safeguarding both liberty and private property against
governmental action. 52</p>
        <p>3. Limited Government. - A different rationale for the
constitutional distribution of powers stresses the goal of limited government.
The executive and judiciary must concur with the legislature in order
for a law to be enforced. No law can be brought to bear against the
citizenry without a broad consensus. Each branch has the power to
prevent legal impositions. This system tends to make it difficult for
government to act unless there is something close to general agreement
that it ought to do so. This rationale echoes Montesquieu's
observation that a system with three branches "should naturally form a state
of repose or inaction."5 3</p>
        <p>49 D. EPSTEIN, supra note 31, at 130 (quoting J. LOCKE, Two TREATISES OF GOVERNMENT
410 (P. Laslett ed. 1965) (3d ed. 169S)). In this respect, the system of checks and balances has
an implicit but powerful equal protection theme.</p>
        <p>so See THE FEDERALIST No. 5X (J. Madison).</p>
        <p>51 The economic term is "agency costs." See Jensen &amp; Meckling, Theory of the Firm:
Managerial Behavior,Agency Costs, and Ownership Structure, 3 J. FIN. ECON. 305 (1976).
52 See Levi, Some Aspects of Separationof Powers, 76 COLuM. L. REV. 371, 374 (1976).
53 C. MONTESQuIEu, THE SPIRIT OF THE LAWS 211 (D. Carrithers ed. 1977) (T. Nugent
trans. 2d ed. 1748).</p>
        <p>For the framers, the legislature posed the primary threat of
unjustified intrusion into the private sphere. The period immediately
before the Constitutional Convention of i787 was characterized, in
the view of many of the framers, by dangerous interventions by the
legislature into the realm of liberty and private property.5 4 The
distribution of national powers was therefore intended to ensure the
protection of individual rights - most prominently rights of property
- against the legislature.5 5</p>
        <p>There is in this respect an intimate connection between the
distribution of national powers, the protection of private ordering, and the
framers' emphasis on the need for "deliberation" before governmental
action.5 6 Deliberation was designed in part as a check against popular
passions for redistribution of wealth.</p>
        <p>4. The Problem of Faction. - The distribution of powers at the
national level also helped resolve a central problem of government:
factionalism, which poses the risk that private groups might usurp
public power in order to redistribute wealth or opportunities in their
favor.5 7 Such private groups, whether minorities or (more likely)
majorities, might use governmental authority to oppress others. The
separation of powers and the system of checks and balances were
intended to reduce that risk. A faction might come to dominate one
branch, but it was unlikely to acquire power over all three. The
distribution of national powers thus operated to protect minorities
from the tyranny of powerful private groups. It is important to
emphasize that the framers' concerns about factionalism,
self-interested representation, and limited government were closely linked, and
indeed ultimately merged in the general effort to use constitutionalism
to limit the thrust of democracy.5 8
5. Stability. - The distribution of national powers does not only
limit government; it also promotes stability by insulating the status
quo from rapid change. In many cases, two or more branches must
concur in order to alter current law; the system is structured to provide
each branch with the means and the will to resist the others. The
desire to promote stability was closely related to the framers' belief in
private property and economic development in a commercial republic.</p>
        <p>Significantly, the system of checks and balances ensured that the
terms of regulation often would be set by the common law courts,
which had a vital place in the system. The importance of this point
cannot be overstated. 5 9 Courts creating and implementing the
common law could play a major role in social ordering, promoting private
markets and resisting the various dangers associated with a
government that combined the power to make, interpret, and execute the
law. A politically insulated judiciary was permitted to assume this
function because the common law was supposed to embody a system
of natural or prepolitical rights; 60 in acting according to the dictates
of "reason," courts were not subject to the risks posed by a
combination of powers in the legislative or executive branch of the national
government. As we will see, all of these understandings came under
sharp attack during the New Deal period.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the federal nature of the system generated
another series of constraints on government, 6 1 promoted flexibility,
accountability, and diversity, and permitted a measure of
self-determination through classically republican participation in government.
The result was a complex system. Madisonian representation at the
national level would allow for deliberation in government; the creation
of a unitary executive and the division of labor would permit national
action to meet national needs; the distribution of national powers
would furnish checks diminishing the risks associated with
factionalism, self-interested representation, and incursions into private property

framing was characterized by excessive democracy); I THE FOUNDERS' CONSTITUTION, supra

        <p>60 See F. McDONALD, supra note 29, at 1-4o, 111-14 (tracing the relevance of common
law to the framers' system). A recent commentator has illustrated this view in a manner
characteristic of the nineteenth century. See R. EPSTEIN, TAKINGS: PRIVATE PROPERTY AND
THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN (1985); Epstein, A Theory of Strict Liability, 2 J. LEGAL
STUD. 151 (1973). The framers' understanding of the common law differed from the
nineteenthcentury formulation; McDonald's historical account of the relevance of property and the common
law is thus substantially different from that offered by Epstein.</p>

distributing power and therefore a means of protecting against abuse).
and liberty; and the federal system would create supplemental
safeguards and allow a measure of citizen self-determination as well.</p>

      <sec id="sec-5-2">
        <title>B. The Second Bill of Rights, the New Deal Agency, and Limited Government</title>
        <p>i. Substantive and institutionalreform. - The modern regulatory
agency emerged largely from deep dissatisfaction with both the
common law system of private ordering and the original distribution of
national powers. 62 The Progressives criticized the common law on a
number of grounds. 6 3 A prominent part of their critique focused on
the antidemocratic character of judicial lawmaking - a problem
particularly severe in the constitutional context, but also troubling with
regard to the common law. The problem was posed most sharply
during the Lochner era, 64 when constitutional constraints owed their
origin and shape to common law categories.</p>
        <p>An additional concern was the anachronistic, or at least
incomplete, character of common law rights. The Depression and the
failures of unregulated businesses made it harder to argue that
governmental intervention beyond common law rules65 was antithetical to
economic productivity. The collapse of the common law market
system during the Depression made the utopian premises of laissez-faire
thought seem fanciful. Indeed, economic recovery seemed to call for
greater coordination and planning. A final concern was the perceived
need for redistribution of wealth and entitlements, 66 which could not
be brought about through the common law. Most fundamentally,
many New Deal reformers regarded the common law itself as a
regulatory scheme, not as prepolitical, and asserted that the common law
had proved wholly inadequate in this regulatory role. 6 7 The very
term "New Deal" is highly suggestive. It connotes a reshuffling of the
cards, from which a different distribution of benefits and burdens
would result.</p>
        <p>Reformers in the New Deal period thus called for the recognition
of a new category of legal rights. Traditional rights of market ordering
no longer captured the category of fundamental interests; they were
both over- and under-inclusive. Rights to governmental assistance in
the employment market, for example, were insufficiently protected by
the common law, as were the interests of the poor, consumers of
dangerous food and drugs, the elderly, traders on securities markets,
and victims of unfair trade practices. At the same time, the common
law system gave undue protection to rights of private property. In
some settings the common law itself seemed a product of factional
power in its protection of some interests and its unwillingness to
recognize others. 68</p>
        <p>This basic theme, a central ingredient of New Deal
constitutionalism, was prominent throughout Roosevelt's presidency. In his
speech accepting the Democratic nomination for the presidency in
1936, for example, Roosevelt argued that although the constitutional
framers were concerned only with political rights, new circumstances
required the recognition of economic rights as well, because "freedom
is no half-and-half affair."6 9 The most dramatic statement of this
revised notion of entitlement came in President Roosevelt's State of
the Union address of I944, which set forth the "Second Bill of Rights"
quoted above. 70 These rights were to apply to all citizens, "regardless
of station, race, or creed."'7 1 The substantive program of the New
Deal thus constituted a rejection of the common law system in favor
of a new conception of rights, albeit of uncertain dimensions. 7 2 The
1987]
program dramatically altered the baselines from which governmental
action or inaction and partisanship or neutrality would be measured.
Although the new conception of rights revised the original
understandings, it maintained a measure of continuity. President Roosevelt
placed the new spirit of entitlement squarely within the framework of
rights; his nomenclature both recalled the original Bill of Rights and
added to it.</p>
        <p>The case for departure from common law ordering took various
forms. Sometimes New Deal reformers emphasized the need for
centralized planning under the authority of the national government. 73
On occasion they stressed the benefits of cartelization in promoting
economic productivity. 74 There is, in this regard, a close connection
between public interest justifications for regulation and explanations
that see regulation as a product of interest-group deals; 75 such deals,
in the form of cartelization, were designed to improve the operation
of a depressed economy. Sometimes regulation was justified on more
conventional economic grounds, such as "market failure" in the form
of externalities ignored by the common law or a lack of information
on the part of consumers and workers. 76</p>
        <p>
          Alternative and potentially more radical grounds for expanding
substantive rights stressed the essentially undemocratic character of
market ordering. In this view, collective control was necessary in
order to achieve democracy. 77 Some regulation was thought to be

        <p>73 For a detailed discussion, see 0. GRAHAM, JR., cited in note I above. The National

centralization.</p>
        <p>74 See The National Industrial Recovery Act, ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195 (i933). The NIRA, of
course, was invalidated in part in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 542
(1935), as an unconstitutional delegation of public power to private groups. Cf. K. DAvIs, supra
note z, at 260-75 (arguing that large business interests dominated the NIRA); E. HAWLEY,

to assert collective control. As an earlier commentator argued:</p>
        <p>For better or worse the American people have proclaimed themselves to be a democracy,
and they have proclaimed that democracy means popular economic, social, and moral
emancipation .... The economic and social changes of the past generation have brought
out a serious and a glaring contradiction between the demands of a constructive
demo</p>
        <p>HeinOnline -- 101 Harv. L. Rev. 439 1987-1988
should remain with the agency. A promising development in this
regard is the recent effort to require agencies to generate timetables
and deadlines within which to respond to petitions to engage in
rulemaking. 3 13</p>
        <p>Under such a system, neither presidential nor judicial control
would be accepted on its own; each would balance the other. In such
a system, political choices would be made by those most accountable;
the paralysis associated with intra-executive checks and balances
would be avoided; collective choices would be permitted; and there
would be a safeguard against decisions that do not accord with the
law or that stem from factional power or self-interested representation.</p>
        <p>(b) The Continuing Value of Checks and Balances. - The
discussion thus far suggests that the New Deal critique of the original
distribution of national powers and its checks and balances was
contingent on a status quo of laissez-faire and a judiciary hostile to
regulation. That critique was badly overdrawn, even (or perhaps
especially) if one believes, as the New Deal reformers did, that
substantial regulatory intervention is highly desirable in some settings.
Four basic factors underlie this conclusion.</p>
        <p>First, a concentration of powers in the presidency or in
administrators insulated from congressional or judicial control does not
necessarily lead to vigorous enforcement of regulatory programs. Such
concentration may instead produce inaction or decisions inconsistent
with the commitments underlying the creation of the regulatory
scheme. If administrators are fully committed to regulatory goals,
checks and balances may seem to be an obstacle to reform; but in a
period of executive ambivalence, checks may be an important
instrument of statutory implementation.</p>
        <p>Second, the distribution of national powers is far from a guarantor
of regulatory inaction. The New Deal critique has its greatest force
when a laissez-faire system prevails; it is possible that checks and
balances may help to perpetuate that system. For this reason, the
critique was more powerful in the 1930's than it is today. If the status
quo favors regulatory intervention, however, checks and balances may
increase the likelihood that regulation will remain in place.</p>
        <p>Third, a system of distributed powers may in fact help those who
seek change, including relatively powerless groups. An important
function of the division of powers is to assure that different branches
pursue different agendas. The existence of three branches of
government thus multiplies the points of access to government, allowing for

Library).
expression of diverse political views. Such a system increases the
likelihood that at least one branch will be responsive to the interests
of politically weak groups and thus will become an advocate for
reform. A single branch often has initiated forms of social change.3 14
For example, the New Deal itself was largely a product of the
leadership of one branch of government - the presidency. In a system
of centralized and undivided power, by contrast, the likelihood that
powerful majorities will remain entrenched is enlarged; no alternative
institution exists to pursue interests adverse to the majority. In this
sense, a government of separated powers has considerable advantages
over more unitary systems.</p>
        <p>Vigorous advocacy by one branch - an option under a system of
distributed powers - may thus serve to create momentum for change.
Such momentum can be especially strong if one branch has the power
to produce reform largely on its own - if, in short, government does
not merely check and balance itself but is truly divided. The current
constitutional structure to a large degree meets this condition because
all three branches are able to generate change independently. In these
circumstances, the New Deal belief that the original distribution of
national powers would inevitably produce inaction, or inevitably
frustrate governmental intervention, is unfounded.</p>
        <p>Fourth, and finally, even if a system of checks and balances may
sometimes decrease the rate and amount of change, rapid change is
hardly always desirable. In any case, the risks of too little change
may be worth incurring in order to decrease factionalism and increase
deliberation in government. The concentration of power in regulatory
agencies may increase responsiveness to swings in popular opinion,
but such responsiveness is far from an inevitable good. A balanced
system of oversight of the sort recommended here is thus preferable
both to the New Deal conception of administrative autonomy and to
partial systems of control as represented, for example, in
recommendations for increased presidential control and decreased judicial
review.3 15</p>
        <p>314 Judicial oversight of executive agencies, when the President has been skeptical of
regulatory enforcement in many areas, is the most recent example. The judiciary has also initiated
substantial changes in the criminal justice system. See, e.g., Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436
(I966); Batson v. Kentucky, io6 S. Ct. 1712 (1986) (holding that the equal protection clause
forbids a prosecutor from challenging potential jurors solely on account of their race). Congress
likewise has brought about significant reform in environmental protection. See Clean Air Act,
42 U.S.C. §§ 7401-7642 (1982); Ackerman, Elliot &amp; Millian, Toward a Theory of Statutory
Evolution: The Federalizationof EnvironmentalLaw, i J.L., ECON. &amp; ORG. 313, 317-18,
33538 (1985) (describing the circumstances surrounding passage of the Clean Air Act).</p>
        <p>31s To be sure, some difficulties accompany the present system of checks and balances, quite
outside the area of administrative law. In particular, the current regime makes it especially
difficult for the President to implement his program, with the occasional exception of vigorous
action at the beginning of the presidential term. More generally, the split between the executive</p>
        <p>At the same time, it is important to be realistic about the value
of institutional changes of the kind proposed here. Indeed, a focus
on institutional checks tends to perpetuate the possibly anachronistic
preoccupation of administrative law with control of discretion. 3 16
Regulatory performance, for example, depends on a wide range of
factors other than institutional arrangements. Appropriations, quality
of personnel, distributions of social power, ideological commitment,
public attitudes, and substantive regulatory controls all play critical
roles. 3 17 The various changes suggested here by themselves will not
cure excessive regulation and implementation failure. Improvement
of the regulatory process must be accompanied by a variety of other
reforms, 3 18 some of which are discussed below. Nonetheless,
institutional changes should make a substantial difference. The increase in
presidential, judicial, and congressional control is likely to serve the
institutional purposes of the original constitutional structure without
at the same time returning to anachronistic conceptions of limited
government.</p>

        <title>E. ConstitutionalConstraints</title>
        <p>The simultaneous rise of executive, judicial, and legislative control
has been accompanied by growing doubts about the constitutional
status of regulatory agencies. Administration has of course been an
important part of the national government since the founding. 3 19 The
recent constitutional doubts, reminiscent of pre-New Deal challenges
to the regulatory process, do not challenge administration in general,
but only particular aspects that are perceived as threats to basic
constitutional principles. Some of those doubts manifest themselves
in renewed efforts to use the nondelegation doctrine to limit agency
discretion. 320 Others form the impetus to urge courts to interpret
article III literally and thus to remove adjudicative functions from
regulatory agencies. 3 2 1 The most important set of challenges question
congressional power to create agencies independent of the President.</p>
        <p>In all these cases, the basic concern is that regulatory agencies
combining traditionally separated functions and immunized from
presidential control are subject to the risk of factionalism and
self-interested representation. The question of congressional authority to create
"independent" agencies is closely associated with the issues explored
thus far; it too calls for an analysis of the relationship between the
system of checks and balances on the one hand and New Deal
constitutionalism on the other.</p>
        <p>The independent agency, defined as an agency whose members are
not subject to the plenary removal power of the President, is the
model of the New Deal institution. It received constitutional sanction
largely on the ground that the Constitution could not be read to bar
expert and insulated officials from designing regulatory policy at the
request of Congress, even though these officials do not fall within any
of the constitutionally specified branches. 322 This understanding has
met sharp criticism in the last decade, 323 however, and it would not
be surprising to see a fundamental attack on the concept of
independent administration in the near future. Such an attack would be the
constitutional analogue of the increasing distrust of New Deal
administration, manifested in the growth of legislative, presidential, and
judicial control.</p>
        <p>These attacks on various aspects of modern administration,
however, are flawed. They rest on methods of constitutional interpretation
that are inadequate, especially in the context of administrative law.
Literal interpretation of the constitutional text and the intent of its
drafters is unhelpful in light of vast changes in the national
government since the founding era. These changes call for an approach that
takes changed circumstances into account, but at the same time
reintroduces into the regulatory process some of the safeguards of the
original constitutional system.</p>

i. Formalism, Holmesianism, and Functionalism.- The last few
years have seen a sharp rise of constitutional "formalism" in cases
involving the separation of powers. Formalist decisions are premised
on the beliefs that the text of the Constitution and the intent of its
drafters are controlling and sometimes dispositive, that changed
circumstances are irrelevant to constitutional outcomes, and that broader
"policy" concerns should not play a role in legal decisions. Although
this type of analysis was most prominent during the early growth of
the modern regulatory state, 324 recent decisions also reflect some of
these ideas. For example, in Buckley v. Valeo, 325 the Supreme Court
struck down provisions of the Federal Election Act on the ground
that members of the Federal Election Commission were not appointed
by the President. Similarly, in INS v. Chadha,32 6 the Court
invalidated the legislative veto on the grounds that it violated the
presentation clause and evaded the constitutional requirement of
bicameralism. And in Bowsher v. Synar,327 the Court invalidated the
GrammRudman-Hollings Act on the ground that article II prohibits Congress
from granting to itself the exclusive power to remove an officer
charged with the execution of the law. All of these decisions treated
the text of the Constitution and the intent of its drafters as if they
supplied clear, self-evident answers to the problem at hand. Changed
circumstances and even underlying considerations of constitutional
structure were largely ignored.</p>
        <p>Constitutional formalism of this sort rests on weak foundations.
The formalist approach is vulnerable to a wide range of objections
relating to the appropriate characterization of the framers' intent, 328
the problem of interpretive intent, and the question how intent should
be treated in unforeseen circumstances. 329 In the context of
administrative law, the critical problem for formalism lies in the massive
alterations in the executive branch since the New Deal. Formalist
approaches assert, for example, that the notion of a "unitary executive"
is sufficient to resolve many questions involving federal administrative
agencies. But the federal government and the executive branch in
particular have changed so dramatically since the founding that
"framers' intent" cannot be mechanically applied as if it settles the matter.</p>
        <p>324 See, e.g., Hampton &amp; Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 404-11 (1928); Field v. Clark,
143 U.S. 649 (1892). For a modern example, see Currie, The Distribution of Powers After

215-17.</p>
        <p>The modern presidency is so different from the entity contemplated
by the framers that it is unrealistic simply to "apply" their choices to
the present situation. At its inception, the American presidency was
by modern standards weak, especially in domestic affairs. 330 Its
regulatory role was minimal. Police powers were exercised principally
by the states. Federal lawmaking was the province of Congress.
General questions of regulation were decided by the state legislatures
and common law courts. Since the New Deal, however, the executive
branch has become a major national policymaker; it often takes the
initiative in lawmaking, exercising powers originally thought to lie
within the domain of Congress and the states. 33 1</p>
        <p>For this reason, the Supreme Court's reasoning in Chadha and
Bowsher was far too mechanical. The constitutionality of the
legislative veto cannot be resolved solely by reference to the constitutional
text. 332 For similar reasons, efforts to reinvigorate a literal approach
to article III in order to remove adjudication from the executive
branch should be resisted. 333 A general revival of the nondelegation
doctrine would also be a mistake in light of a range of considerations:
good reasons support the delegation of discretion, 334 standards can be
extrapolated from seemingly vague statutes, judicial administration of
a nondelegation principle would be both difficult and intrusive, and
surrogate safeguards are available. 33 5 Of course, extreme measures,
like that in Schechter Poultry, should be invalidated.</p>
        <p>At the opposite pole from constitutional formalism is a position
that one might associate with Justice Holmes: courts should presume
that whatever Congress does in the area of separation of powers is
constitutional, unless no plausible argument can be made in its
favor.336 Under the "Holmesian" view, separation of powers questions
are essentially nonjusticiable, because the relevant institutions are able
to protect themselves. 3 37 Some observers have argued in favor of a
Holmesian approach on the ground that changed circumstances make
the original constitutional commitments less relevant or more
obscure. 338 Others have adopted the position because of the alleged

indeterminacy of the constitutional text.3 39 In the 1930's, the Supreme
Court used a Holmesian approach to decide several cases involving
separation of powers issues and administrative agencies, 34 0 but it has
not done so recently.</p>
        <p>The Holmesian approach, however, is little better than formalism.
In its usual form, it amounts to a wholesale abandonment of the
separation of powers, and its belief in a self-calibrating institutional
equilibrium, based on the supposedly equal power of the opposing
forces, is without historical or theoretical support. There is good
reason to suppose that without adequate controls one branch will
sometimes exercise too much power over the others. 34 1 One of the
purposes of the Constitution was to prevent that outcome and to check
imbalances when they occur.34 2 Acquiescence by one branch to a
redistribution of national powers may not prevent - indeed it may
increase - the danger that the new arrangement will jeopardize some
of the purposes that underlie the constitutional structure. The
Holmesian position, effectively immunizing political outcomes from
constitutional checks, is therefore inadequate.</p>
        <p>The alternative to formalism and Holmesianism might be described
as functionalism. 343 In general terms, functional approaches examine
whether present practices undermine constitutional commitments that
should be regarded as central. The text of the Constitution and the
intent of its drafters are relevant, but they are not sufficiently helpful
in hard cases to be determinative; it is the basic structural principles
that play the critical role. 3 44 As suggested above, those principles
include the unitary execution of the laws, avoidance of factionalism,
protection against self-interested or unaccountable representation, and

to develop new institutional forms); cf. Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 53-54 (1932) (arguing
that a congressional grant of limited adjudicative powers to a non-article III tribunal can be
justified to the extent it relieves the judiciary of an excessive workload).</p>

v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952).</p>
        <p>342 Moreover, the fact that the legislative and executive branches are in agreement is an
insufficient reason to foreclose a constitutional attack; the relevant provisions are designed not
only to ensure the integrity of the branches but also to protect the citizenry. See Chadha,462

promotion of deliberation in government. 345 A functional approach
maintains, for example, that the constitutionality of the legislative
veto should not have been resolved solely by reference to the text. 3 46
Nonetheless, a functional approach would yield the same result as in
Chadha. Practice had shown that the legislative veto aggravated the
problem of factionalism 34 7 - the very problem it was designed to
solve. In practice, the device provided well-organized private groups
an additional opportunity to fend off regulation. In this way, it
undermined the central constitutional effort to diminish the power of
well-organized private groups over governmental processes.</p>
        <p>Although Bowsher is a harder case, it can be analyzed similarly.
The congressional vesting of power in the Comptroller General
removed the power of execution of the laws from the direct control of
executive officials because, in practice, the Comptroller General
operated independently of the President. 348 Execution of the laws was
thus placed in the hands of someone who was, in practice, accountable
to no one. An- alternative defense of Bowsher would point to the
dangers of combining legislative and executive functions, because the
Comptroller General is subject to congressional removal and has
traditionally viewed himself as a congressional agent.</p>
        <p>Of course, there are problems with the functional approach as
well. In particular, it allows for a large degree of discretion (and
therefore uncertainty) both in characterizing the appropriate
constitutional commitment and in deciding whether it has been violated.
By contrast, the formalist and Holmesian approaches are highly
predictable. The vices of functionalism in this regard can also be
regarded as virtues, however, because they permit functionalism to
avoid the defects in formal and Holmesian approaches.</p>

        <p>tutional formalism has been of special importance in recent attacks
on "independent" agencies. Although the first independent agency, the
Interstate Commerce Commission, was created in the late nineteenth
century, the notion of agency independence did not become popular
until several decades later, as a result of fears about an unduly
powerful presidency and an accompanying belief in the salutary effects of
impartial expertise. 34 9 In part, the rise of independent agencies can
also be viewed as an indication of the power of private industries,
which believed that commissions would treat them more favorably. 35 0

The New Deal saw the creation of a number of independent agencies,
although, as with the Interstate Commerce Commission, limitations
on presidential removal power predated the New Deal. 35 ' The form
has been much less popular in the last twenty years, partly because
of a perception that independent agencies have been, in practice,
subject to the influence of well-organized private groups. 3 52</p>
        <p>The notion of independent administration is congruent with the
Madisonian conception of representation in its desire to insulate public
officials from political pressures. 3 53 But the New Deal conception of
administration coupled the belief in insulation with optimism about
the power of immersion in the facts and of technical expertise to
resolve regulatory problems. Moreover, the advocates of the New
Deal saw insulation as a mechanism for disrupting rather than
preserving the status quo - a reversal of the view of the constitutional
framers. The independent agency was a natural outgrowth of the
New Deal plan.</p>
        <p>Despite some continuity with Madisonian theory, the independent
agency is in considerable tension with principles traceable to the

regulatory authority to an agency that is somewhat more susceptible than an executive
department to influence, persuasion, and eventually, capture and control"); see also D. TRUMAN, THE
GOVERNMENTAL PROCESS 417-19 (2d ed. 1971) (asserting that regulated groups have preferred
regulation by independent agencies to supervision by an executive commission).
351 See infra notes 358-61.</p>
        <p>352 An influential critique of agency independence written thirty years ago can be found in
M. BERNSTEIN, cited in note 3 above. For a contrary view, see Jaffe, cited in note 126 above,
at 1187, 1193, 1198--99. The decline of agency independence apparently reflects the belief that
presidential supervision will operate as a buffer against factionalism. The EPA and OSHA are
within the executive branch. Only a few of the modern safety and health statutes are
administered by independent agencies. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 717i(a) (1982) (the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission); I5 U.S.C. § 2053(a) (1982) (the Consumer Product Safety Commission).
Recent history thus suggests considerable congressional ambivalence about the independent
agency.</p>
        <p>In practice, there is little difference between independent and executive agencies in terms of
their functions. Many departments within the executive branch engage in activities that are
indistinguishable from those of the independent agencies. Both types of entities undertake the
basic tasks of adjudication, rulemaking, and prosecution. Moreover, independent agencies are
by no means genuinely liberated from political control. Such agencies perceive themselves as
subject to the control of Congress, whose committees exercise a powerful supervisory function.
The President, furthermore, has a range of formal and informal mechanisms for controlling
agencies nominally outside of his jurisdiction. See Strauss, supra note 43, at 589-91; see also
M. BERNSTEIN, supra note 3, at 109-13 (describing such mechanisms). Indeed, a recent study
suggests that the behavior of independent agencies varies systematically with presidential
partisanship. See Moe, Regulatory Performance and PresidentialAdministration, 26 AM. J. POL.
SCI. 197, 221 (1982). In some cases, however, Congress has decided that immunity from plenary
presidential control is desirable. There can be no doubt that independence allows agencies some
measure of insulation from presidential authority and increases the supervisory power of
legislative committees, which need not contend with the insulating effect of presidential support.

inal constitutional framework. The first section of article II vests
executive power in "a President. '35 4 The "take Care" clause makes it
the duty of the President, and no one else, to "take Care that the
Laws be faithfully executed."355 These provisions reflect the framers'
self-conscious decision to create a unitary executive who would be
both accountable to the electorate and capable of energetic execution
of the laws.</p>
        <p>This basic understanding of the executive branch found powerful
vindication in Myers v. United States,35 6 in which the Supreme Court
held that Congress could not involve itself in the decision whether to
remove a postniaster. 35 7 In Humphrey's Executor v. United States,358
however, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the constitutionality of
the independent agencies. Referring to the need for expertise and
impartiality, the Court stated that the members of the FTC were to
be independent in all things but their appointment, and that the FTC
was not "in any proper sense ... an arm or an eye of the
executive. ' 35 9 For the Court, the Commission "acts in part
quasi-legislatively and in part quasi-judicially" and is "an agency of the legislative
and judicial departments." 3 60 At least until recently, Humphrey's
Executor has been interpreted ag establishing congressional discretion to
create independent agencies as long as the relevant officials have
adjudicative or rulemaking functions. 36 1</p>
        <p>Skepticism about the constitutional status of the independent
agency has been renewed in the last decade, however,3 62 and there
are signs that the legal meaning of independence will change in the
near future. Such developments should not be surprising in light of

a misunderstanding. At the time of Humphrey's Executor, it had not been established that the
FTC had rulemaking power. By "quasi-legislative" functions, the Court was referring to
investigatory and reportorial actions. See Scalia, supra note 323, at lo9.</p>
        <p>Strictly speaking, Humphrey's Executor is an exceedingly narrow holding. The Court held
only that a discharged member of the FTC has a right to back pay. The case did not involve
a suit for reinstatement, and thus the Court did not conclude that Congress may ensure job
tenure - only that compensation is due to those whom the President discharges. Moreover,
the case did not involve a discharge on the ground of a refusal to implement presidential policy.</p>

put a high premium on insulation. This skepticism has been boosted
by the formalist approach of recent Supreme Court decisions - an
approach that is in severe tension with the analysis in Humphrey's

notion of quasi-legislative and quasi-adjudicative functions, pivotal to
the decision, is unhelpful. 363 The simple point for the formalist critics
is that the Constitution makes no room for a governmental entity
existing "outside" the three enumerated branches, and constitutional
silence suggests that no such entity may exist. Constitutional
formalism provides at least as powerful an argument against the existence
of independent agencies as it offers against the
Gramm-RudmanHollings Act and the legislative veto. The President, not independent
administrators, is the constitutionally specified agent of Congress in
the execution of federal law.</p>
        <p>There are, however, several counterarguments to the formalist
position. The text of the Constitution and its history 364 do not provide
unambiguous support for the attack on independent administration;
and the changing character of the modern presidency makes it
unrealistic to rely on founders' intent or to pretend that it can be
mechanically applied to current problems. In light of the massive
changes in the nature of the presidency, the decision to create a unitary
executive cannot be treated as if it resolved the matter. Indeed, the
decision to permit the creation of "independent" agencies might be
understood as a necessary quid pro quo for the downfall of the
nondelegation doctrine. The independent agency device allows Congress
to limit presidential power in lawmaking, which has assumed
unprecedented dimensions since the New Deal. In this sense, it might be
thought to bring the national government closer to the original system
of checks and balances.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the term "independent" is in practice a misnomer.
There are lines of control from both Congress and the President to
the independent agencies. 365 Even if the Constitution might bar
Congress from creating regulatory agencies entirely immune from
presidential control, congressional creation of independent agencies need
not be understood in such terms.</p>
        <p>Although the formalist attack against independent agencies was at
least implicitly at issue in Bowsher, the Court attempted to evade the
problem. The Court indicated that its decision had no bearing on the
constitutionality of the concept of independent administration. 366 The
363 See Miller, supra note 323, at 93.</p>

        <p>365 See Strauss, supra note 43, at 587-96; supra note 352.
366 See Bowsher v. Synar, io6 S. Ct. 3181, 3188 n.4 (1986).
Court's language in Bowsher, however, may have an impact on the
issue, in ways that fit comfortably with a functional approach to the
question. The Court held that the enumerated bases for removal of
the Comptroller General by Congress - inefficiency, neglect of duty,
abuse of office - were "very broad" and permitted discharge "for any
number of actual or perceived transgressions of the legislative will." 36 7
Yet the statutes creating independent agencies use almost precisely the
same language. If this language creates "very broad" removal
authority, the so-called independent agencies are not in practice
independent of presidential control. 368</p>
        <p>Whatever the ultimate meaning of agency independence, and
whether or not it is found constitutional, it should not be surprising
if the recent attacks on independence and the related decline in the
New Deal conception of administration eventually lead to increased
presidential control of all regulatory agencies. Such a development
would be highly desirable. Understood functionally, total
independence threatens central principles of electoral accountability. There is
evidence that the lack of accountability of independent regulatory
agencies has led to abuses. 3 69 The constitutional commitments to the
avoidance of factionalism and to limitations on the disjunction
between rulers and ruled tend to support presidential supervision. The
various policies underlying the notion of a unitary presidency are also
relevant.3 70</p>
        <p>In any event, there is no reason to believe that the independent
agency form - if independence is understood literally - is needed to
carry out the principal substantive purposes of New Deal
administration.3 7 1 Moreover, such control increases the likelihood of achieving
an irriportant institutional goal of the New Deal - to provide for
agency officials who serve public law. At the same time, presidential
supervision of independent agencies would be an additional step in
the reintroduction of checks and balances into the current
administrative process, supplementing the various measures described and
advocated above.</p>
        <p>367 Id. at 3190.</p>
        <p>368 This conclusion is buttressed by clear-statement principles of statutory construction, which
counsel courts to avoid interpretations of statutes that pose constitutional issues. See, e.g., Kent
v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, 127-30 (1958) (construing statute so as to avoid constitutional questions).
Under this approach, statutes with ambiguous language should be read to allow considerable
presidential supervisory power.</p>
        <p>369 See M. BERNSTEIN, supra note 3.</p>
        <p>370 See id. at 163, 286-87; NATIONAL ACADEMY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, supra note
145, at 15-20.</p>
        <p>371 Some independence, however, is necessary if the agency is to serve any role at all. For
example, although the President may not make the ultimate decision, a point recognized in
Myers itself, he may remove an officer after the decision is made. See supra p. 498. Moreover,
agencies require some independence when acting in an adjudicatory mode. See Myers v. United
States, 272 U.S. 52, 135 (1926).
IV. REGULATION, RIGHTS, AND LOCAL SELF-DETERMINATION
The discussion thus far has dealt primarily with the challenge of
the New Deal to the system of checks and balances and with the
reaction to those innovations in the last quarter-century. As discussed
above, however, the New Deal significantly altered two other aspects
of the constitutional structure: individual rights and federalism. The
New Deal reformers rejected common law and status quo baselines
for defining substantive entitlements, and believed that the presidency
and regulatory agencies provided better opportunities than state and
local government for democratic self-determination. A complete
discussion of constitutionalism after the New Deal must thus address not
only the questions of national institutions, but also those involving
individual rights and federalism. Such a discussion must also deal
with substantive, as opposed to institutional, reform of administrative
law. 3 72 For present purposes, a few brief remarks should suffice.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-5-5">
        <title>A. Rights</title>
        <p>The New Deal reformers asserted that the catalog of rights
protected by the common law was not natural or prepolitical, but a
conscious social choice.3 7 3 This understanding dramatically shifted
the baseline for distinguishing between governmental "action" and
"inaction," or neutrality and impermissible partisanship - a point
that modern public law has insufficiently recognized. In the pre-New
Deal era, courts sometimes viewed deviations from the common law
and the status quo as interference with the natural order, and as
impermissible violations of principles of neutrality and
nonpartisanship. This was the understanding that prevailed in the Lochner era,
during which an aggressive Supreme Court identified the requirements
of the due process clause with those of the common law.3 74</p>
        <p>When the Court rejected Lochner, it did so largely on the ground
that the common law baseline from which the Court had been
operating could no longer be justified. 3 75 The Court recognized that
re372 See generally S. BREYER, supra note 26 (presenting a general analysis of regulatory
reform); Stewart, supra note 318 (advocating the adoption of "reconstitutive" regulatory strategies
as an alternative to both reliance on current regulatory systems and deregulation).
373 See supra p. 423.</p>
        <p>374 See New York Cent. R.R. v. White, 243 U.S. 188, 201 (,9,7) (suggesting that if
government abrogates common law rights it must provide a "reasonably just substitute"). See generally
Sunstein, supra note 135 (describing the influence of common law baselines).</p>
        <p>375 It should be unsurprising that the same Court that rejected the Lochner era understanding
decided Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), in which the common law was similarly
found to be constructed rather than natural or prepolitical. See West Coast Hotel v. Parrish,
300 U.S. 379, 399 (,937) (finding that failure to have a minimum wage law is a "subsidy" to
employers); Miller v. Schoene, 276 U.S. 272, 279 (1928) (stating that failure to regulate is
"nonetheless a choice").
spect for the common law baseline and for the existing distribution of
wealth and entitlements could itself be governmental "action" or the
product of faction; the common law was itself a creation of the legal
system.3 7 6 The lesson of the demise of Lochner was that common
law or status quo baselines should no longer be used reflexively in
public law.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding this understanding, pre-New Deal conceptions of
legal rights permeate modern public law. For example, doctrines of
judicial review of administrative action depend importantly on the
common law. The interests of regulatory beneficiaries are not always
judicially cognizable, most significantly in the areas of standing and
judicial review of agency inaction. 3 77 State action doctrine turns not
on whether the state has "acted," but on whether it has departed from
governmental functions that are seen as normal or natural, 378 largely
from a -common law point of view. The partial abrogation of a
trespass law is thus uncontroversially state action, and possibly
unconstitutional, 379 whereas the enforcement of the law of trespass, and
the repeal of a law prohibiting private racial discrimination, are
treated as constitutionally legitimate and perhaps do not represent

        <p>This view of law as a social construct was an outgrowth of legal realism. See Hale, supra
note ii,at 493-94. The Coase theorem, see Coase, The Problem of Social Cost, 3 J.L. &amp;
ECON. i (ig6o), was a natural product of New Deal understandings. It, too, upset ordinary
understandings of action and inaction by revealing that judgments about causation, or about
who injured whom, were conventional rather than natural. See B. ACKERMAN, supra note 135,
at 46-7, (1985). The Coase theorem was thus the private law analogue to the constitutional
overruling of Lochner.</p>

state action at all. 380 Similarly, the right to a hearing depends in part
on whether a common law interest or instead an interest thought to
be "created by the government" is at stake. The law of procedural
due process thus reflects a distinction, based on common law
categories, between natural and positive rights38 1 - a distinction that
was repudiated during the New Deal.</p>
        <p>The debate over "positive" and "negative" rights also depends on
the choice of baselines. Whether a right is "positive" or "negative"
turns out to depend largely on whether it calls for alterations in
existing practices. The selection of such baselines has been
particularly critical in cases involving the imposition of "affirmative" duties
on government: The protection of the trespass laws is thus generally
perceived as a negative guarantee, whereas protection of welfare rights
is viewed as a positive one. 3 82 Distinctions of this sort turn not on a
genuine inquiry into the negative or positive character of the rights,
but on whether they require government to depart from common law
categories.</p>
        <p>Cases involving discrimination on the basis of race and gender
raise similar issues. Thus, for example, the constitutional attack on
"affirmative action" - indeed the very term - depends on acceptance,
as a baseline, of the existing distribution of benefits and burdens as
between blacks and whites and women and men. If the existing
distribution were seen as a product of public and private decisions, it
would be harder to argue that indifference to race, as reflected in
market outcomes, was the course of "neutrality" or "inaction."
Similarly, gender-discrimination law is marked by a debate whether some
differences are "real" rather than socially constructed. 3 83 An approach
consistent with New Deal understandings would recognize that even
"real" differences are given their meaning by legal and social
practices. 384 Such an approach would recognize, for example, that the

indicating that repeal of those statutes is by itself permissible).</p>

(suggesting an approach to gender discrimination that focuses on the ways in which differences are
turned into disadvantages, rather than on the ways in which differences arise).

legal treatment of reproductive rights and of abortion raises questions
not only of privacy, but also of sex discrimination. 385</p>
        <p>A major task for the future is to bring the basic understanding of
the New Deal - the socially constructed character of legal rights
to bear on current doctrine. 386 Such a step would produce significant
shifts in the baselines from which decisions are made. 387 The eventual
goal would be to produce a theory of legal rights that is sometimes
critical of existing practice, that is not merely positivist, and that does
not rely on the status quo or the common law as the foundation from
which to evaluate legal outcomes. That task is a large one, and it is
doubtful that the courts can perform it on their own. The legislative
and executive branches must play an important role. The effort,
discussed above, 3 88 to place the interests of regulatory beneficiaries on
the same footing as those of regulated industries would be an
important step in this direction, and it might serve as a model for future
development.</p>

        <title>B. Republican Self-Government and Substantive Reform</title>
        <p>In the original constitutional system, federalism provided an
avenue for local self-determination. Self-government by the citizenry
could be achieved through state and local government. 3 89 At the same
time, the states and the national government would control each
other,3 90 generating a vertical check on government oppression.
Competition among the states for residents would act as an additional
safeguard, encouraging humane and efficient policies.</p>
        <p>In the New Deal period, however, the belief in localism seemed
unrealistic or perverse. State government seemed to be a forum for
parochial pressures rather than for republican self-government. 3 9 1
The states were far too large to allow for face-to-face democracy. The
notion of vertical checks and balances among competing local and
federal spheres seemed inconsistent with the need for active
govern385 See C. MAcKINNON, supra note 383, at 32-45.</p>

that normative commitments are built into language itself); T. NAGEL, THE VIEW FROM

mental intervention to counteract the Depression. Competition among
the states would generate a "race to the bottom" that would both harm
the disadvantaged and prevent coordinated action. New Deal
reformers willingly abandoned the belief in self-determination through local
government and looked instead to national institutions, and in
particular to regulatory agencies and to the presidency, to fulfill democratic
aspirations. 3 92</p>
        <p>In the 1930's, there was good reason for this basic position.
Economic conditions, in particular, made local measures appear hopelessly
inadequate. In retrospect, however, the New Deal's wholesale
abandonment of the original goals of federalism was myopic. The New
Deal actors were far too cavalier in their treatment of the problem.
National institutions are at best an imperfect arena for obtaining
selfdetermination by the citizenry, and federal controls are often
excessively rigid and inefficient. The presidency itself, although visible, is
hardly a forum for republican self-government. More importantly,
experience has shown that the New Deal faith that autonomous
administration would serve democratic goals was unjustified. The
modern administrative agency has attenuated the links between citizens
and governmental processes. Although reinvigoration of checks and
balances should increase the democratic character of federal
administration, it is no longer credible to believe that federal agencies can
serve as an outlet for democratic aspirations. In this respect, the
original framework of dual sovereignty was far superior to the New
Deal understanding.</p>
        <p>In the last quarter-century, there have been numerous efforts to
provide mechanisms to ensure citizen participation in the public and
private spheres. 393 The task for the future is to incorporate New Deal

interstate competition, 3 94 and more recent perceptions of the frequently
negative effect of state autonomy on disadvantaged groups, 3 95 into a

system that seeks to promote geographical diversity, local
self-determination, and citizen participation in government.</p>
        <p>That task is also a large one, but it is possible to identify some
promising reforms. One strategy would be to reformulate national
regulatory schemes, taking the form of prescriptive rules, through a
sort of "reconstitutive law" that allows increased state, local, and
private flexibility.396 Reconstitutive approaches do not attempt to
mandate particular results; they are thus distinguished from, for
example, national occupational or health standards and "command and
control" regulation requiring companies or states to reduce pollution
to a certain level by specified means at a specified time. Reconstitutive
approaches attempt to promote regulatory purposes through such
flexible methods as reallocating entitlements, altering procedures, or
shifting jurisdictional boundaries. Such methods encourage but do not
compel particular outcomes; instead, they create incentives or
pressures that nonetheless allow for private and local flexibility in a
restructured marketplace.</p>
        <p>Some reconstitutive approaches include protecting and encouraging
collective bargaining in labor law instead of imposing uniform national
standards, 3 97 providing for tradable emissions permits instead of
mandating national pollution controls, 39 8 allowing diverse forms of
broadcasting regulations in different communities, and relaxing conditions
in federal grant programs. 39 9 In the area of welfare and social
services, states might also be granted some powers currently reserved to
the federal government. Such an effort might have as its purpose the
encouragement of experimentation and diversity in job training for
the unemployed. Another approach to promoting self-determination
is the movement toward economic and workplace democracy, 400 which
has the advantage of seeking participation and self-determination in
areas in which citizens are already actively engaged. 40 1 In all of these</p>

contexts, state and local officials might be given authority to establish
procedures and to impose different sorts of controls. The national
government could create ceilings and floors that permit local
discretion.</p>
          <p>Strategies of this sort, however, should be undertaken only in
certain areas. As the New Deal reformers were aware, competition
among the states has a dark side. States often try to outbid each
other in an effort to attract job- and revenue-producing industries by
eliminating desirable regulation, 40 2 such as occupational health and
safety measures. In addition, competitive pressures make minimal
guarantees of income and social services extremely difficult to furnish
at the state level. 40 3 In some contexts, moreover, a national moral
commitment, often having constitutional foundations, calls for
uniform federal standards - a point that is buttressed by the frequently
negative effects of state and local autonomy on traditionally
disadvantaged groups. 40 4 Discrimination on the basis of race and gender
is a particularly inapt area for devolution of regulatory control to the
states. The case for national requirements is thus strongest when
interstate competition reduces regulation and income redistribution
below the optimal level, when there are interstate spillovers or
freerider effects, and when powerful moral commitments call for
uniformity.</p>
          <p>The case for deregulation and devolution to state and local
authorities often depends on the purpose of a regulatory scheme. Some
regulatory schemes are designed to promote economic goals; 40 5 some
are redistributive; 40 6 others are designed to protect rights. 407 Some
regulatory programs are also intended to shape preferences, 40 8 to
reflect the outcome of deliberative processes among the citizenry or
representatives, or to promote noncommodity or public values. 40 9
Such measures include regulation of broadcasting, protection of the
environment, 4 10 and prohibition of discrimination on the basis of race

and gender. 41 ' Efforts to sort out and specify the various purposes of
regulation often reveal that deregulation or devolution to states and
localities will be beneficial.</p>
          <p>The basic goal of deregulation, devolution, and reconstitutive
strategies is to promote economic productivity, diversity, and flexibility,
while recognizing the need, on both economic and noneconomic
grounds, for substantial national intervention into private markets.
By relaxing national controls, these strategies would also promote
selfdetermination at the local level. Such strategies should be seen above
all as an effort to integrate the New Deal reformation of rights with
the existence, in the original constitutional regime, of opportunities
for local self-determination. Movements toward local control are thus
the analogue, at the vertical level, to the revival of the system of
checks and balances at the horizontal level. In concert, such reforms
will promote the purposes of the original constitutional plan without
relying on common law or status quo baselines or retreating to
anachronistic understandings of private rights.</p>
          <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>
          <p>The distribution of national powers was designed to ensure a
sensible division of labor, to promote deliberation in government, and
to provide a series of checks against factional power and self-interested
representation. The original constitutional framework was also
associated with the system of common law ordering, because the scheme
of checks and balances made national action more difficult, thus
allowing states and the common law courts to set the basic terms of
regulation.</p>
          <p>In its substantive dimension, New Deal constitutionalism
self-consciously rejected the common law. It held that a new conception of
legal rights was necessary to protect workers, the poor, the elderly,
consumers, and others disadvantaged by the marketplace. Above all,
New Deal constitutionalism recognized that baselines derived from the
common law or the status quo no longer provided neutral or natural
standpoints from which to make legal decisions.</p>
          <p>The institutional position of the New Deal followed naturally from
this critique. In the view of the 193o's reformers, the original
distribution of national powers obstructed necessary governmental action.
The New Deal alternative was both to increase the power of the
presidency and to create the modern administrative agency, comprised
of technically sophisticated officials promoting the public interest.
New Deal agencies were expected to energize government and to
411 See, e.g., Lawrence, supra note 81, at 350-51.
escape the paralysis associated with the judiciary and the system of
checks and balances.</p>
          <p>The New Deal period thus saw a simultaneous attack on the
substantive and the institutional legacy of the original constitutional
regime. New Deal constitutionalism maintained a measure of
continuity with the Madisonian belief in deliberative government, but the
reformers of the 1930's intended deliberation to result in reconstruction
rather than preservation of the existing distribution of wealth and
entitlements.</p>
          <p>The last three decades have seen a growing rejection of the New
Deal conception of administration, although the substantive critique
of the common law has remained largely intact. Because they lack
internal checks and balances, administrative agencies pose special
risks from the standpoint of the traditional distribution of national
powers. Dangers of factionalism and self-interested representation
have been the foremost concern of modern administrative law. Most
proposals for regulatory reform, whether judicial, executive, or
legislative, stem from that preoccupation.</p>
          <p>The demise of the New Deal institutional structure first manifested
itself in the courts, as judge-made doctrines were developed to "flush
out" impermissible bases for regulatory decisions. The consequence is
the modern hard-look doctrine, which rests on a deliberative
conception of administration. Properly understood, the doctrine protects
beneficiaries of regulation on the same terms as regulated class
members. American presidents, too, have increasingly exerted control over
the bureaucracy, most recently by delegating supervisory power to
OMB. In addition, Congress has enacted judicially enforceable
deadlines, "goals" statutes, and precise regulatory guidelines to ensure that
agencies do not subvert regulatory statutes in the implementation
process. The three branches of government have thus intruded on
agency autonomy in ways that have restored some of the features of
the original constitutional framework.</p>
          <p>The recent exercises of power by each branch of government reject
the New Deal conception of administration. All have been highly
controversial. Judicial control is said to substitute uninformed,
unaccountable judges for technically expert and politically responsible
administrators. Presidential power has generated sharp attack by
critics who favor a New Deal model of autonomous administration.
Congressional specificity is said to give rise to risks associated with
factionalism and lack of technical competence.</p>
          <p>Simultaneous presidential, legislative, and judicial control can,
however, be tied tightly both to the underlying goal of deliberative
government and to the purposes of the original distribution of national
powers. These controls can ensure that agency decisions take account
of governing statutes, technical facts, and "politics," properly
understood. It is a mistake to adopt a wholly technocratic or wholly
political conception of administration. The deliberative approach outlined
here maintains continuity with both the original framework and the
New Deal, and accommodates political choice and technical
specialization. A system of oversight by the constitutionally specified
branches does not produce blind adherence to the status quo. By
proliferating points of access to government, it may, on the contrary,
increase the opportunities for groups to seek and obtain reform.</p>
          <p>The task for the future is to achieve some of the purposes
underlying the distribution of powers without abandoning the understanding
that the common law system of regulation is insufficient. This task
has three components. At the national level, the goal is to promote
Madisonian representation while furnishing safeguards against
factionalism and self-interested representation. At the local level, the
task is to promote diversity, participation, and self-government in such
a way as to accomplish traditional republican goals, which are
inadequately served either by modern state government or by the
presidency.4 12 In terms of legal rights, the goal is to develop a set of
entitlements that does not take the common law or the status quo as
the baseline for decision. In this context, New Deal insights have
been insufficiently incorporated into modern public law, which
continues to rely on questionable understandings of "neutrality" and
"inaction."</p>
          <p>All of these tasks are formidable ones. In particular, the notion
of Madisonian representation has to some degree broken down in
practice, 413 and the system of checks and balances is closely associated
with fear of governmental "action" and acceptance of governmental
"inaction." Devolution to the states must be selective, and must guard
against elimination of regulatory safeguards that national institutions
are uniquely able to furnish. Development of a system of legal rights
that rejects status quo baselines is enormously difficult.</p>
          <p>Reforms of the sorts suggested here must be part of a far broader
strategy for reconstruction of the constitutional system in light of
developments occurring during and after the New Deal. It may not
be too optimistic however, to suggest that we have put in place some
of the structures with which to begin the task of integrating the growth
of bureaucracy and the rejection of the common law into a system
that seeks to diminish the risks of factional tyranny and self-interested
representation.</p>
