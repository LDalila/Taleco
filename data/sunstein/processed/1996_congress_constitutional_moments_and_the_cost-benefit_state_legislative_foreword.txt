Congress,  Constitutional  Moments,  and the
Cost-Benefit  State

Cass  R.  Sunstein*

In this article, Cass Sunstein explores the 104th Congress' attempts at reg-
ulatory reform.  Professor Sunstein believes that the election of this Congress,
with  its distinctive approach to government, signals the dawning of a  "consti-
tutional moment"  in which the role of government at all levels will be reexam-
ined.  Without full public support for sweeping changes in government, this
moment has not yet materialized.  When and if it does, regulatory reform will
be one of its aspects. Indeed the nation has already begun to examine regula-
tion to determine if the benefits justify the costs.  Unfortunately, the 104th Con-
gress has, thus far, failed adequately to  address this burgeoning cost-benefit
state.  Sunstein claims that Congress'failure reflects its inability to  redesign
the massive federal regulatory scheme.  He suggests that the executive branch
should oversee regulatory reform, with  Congress relegated to providing broad
policy direction. Sunstein also suggests that Congress adopt an Administrative
Substance Act,  building upon  the recent learning about the performance of
regulation and modeled after the Administrative Procedure Act.  Sunstein fur-
ther calls for the enactment of a  "substantive supermandate" requiring a gen-
eral background rule of cost-benefit balancing for all federal regulation; but
he contends that any  description of costs and benefits  should reflect the full
range of diverse values expressed by  the public at large.

LEGISLATIVE FOREWORD

A.  A  Stalled Constitutional Moment

I. 

INTRODUCTION

The  104th  Congress  promised to  change the national  government  in funda-
mental  ways.  Spurred  by widespread  popular  dissatisfaction  with  government,
the  House  of Representatives  attempted  to  rethink  national  institutions  more
deeply  than at  any time  since  the New Deal;  in  fact the New Deal  itself was  a
central  target  of the process  of rethinking.  America  may be  on the verge  of a
constitutional  moment  in  which  Americans  answer  foundational  questions  in
novel  ways.'

The  election  of the 104th  Congress  signalled the transformation  of America
into a genuinely post-New  Deal regulatory  state.  This  emerging nation  remains
in a process of development; but  it may be described  as  a cost-benefit state, one
whose performance  will be assessed,  both in particular  and in general,  by com-
paring  the  costs  of government  action  with  its  benefits.  This  idea  requires  a
good  deal  of specification,  but it unites  developments  not only  in  the  national
legislature,  but in  the executive  branch,  the judiciary,  and state  government  as
well. 2

My purpose  here  is  to  evaluate  the  efforts  of the  104th  Congress  to  give
legal  form  to  this  constitutional  moment.  My particular  interest  is  Congress'
effort to reform the modem regulatory state.  Charged  by a popular mandate  for
reform  and  a  high  level  of ambition,  Congress  debated  both  substantive  and
procedural  "supermandates"  cutting  across  all  federal  regulation. 3  Thus  the
104th  Congress  devoted  a large part  of its  agenda to  "rethinking the regulatory
state."  The  Contract With  America also  promised  to  address  basic  regulatory
issues.4  In  large-scale  hearings,  Congress  examined  problems  of overregula-

1.  I  borrow the  idea of a constitutional  moment  from  Bruce  Ackerman,  who proposes  a "dualist"
approach  to constitutional  interpretation-an  approach that claims that America  has witnessed two  types
of decisions:  foundational  ones  made  by the  American  people  and more ordinary  ones made  by  their
representatives.  1 BRUCE AcKEImsAN,  WE  Ta  PEOPLE:  FoUNDATIONS  6  (1991).  A constitutional  mo-
ment  is  a  period  of popular  development  of principles  that results  in  revolutionary  reform.  Id.  at  21.
Ackerman  identifies  three  such moments  in  American  history:  the  Founding, Reconstruction,  and  the
New  Deal.  Id. at  58; see also text  accompanying  notes  16-34  infra.

2.  Thus Executive  Orders by Presidents Reagan and Clinton endorse cost-benefit  analysis in some
form. See Exec.  Order No.  12,866,  3 C.F.R.  638  (1994),  reprinted in  5 U.S.C. ยง  601  (1994)  (mandating
that agencies  assess the costs and benefits of a regulation  before  adopting it);  Exec.  Order No.  12,498, 3
C.F.R. 323  (1986),  repinted in 5 U.S.C.  ยง  601  (1988)  (requiring  agencies  to submit a plan  of proposed
regulations  annually)  (revoked  1993);  Exec.  Order  No.  12,291,  3  C.F.R.  127  (1982),  reprinted in  5
U.S.C.  ยง 601  (1988)  (prohibiting regulatory  action  unless  the potential  benefits  of the regulation  out-
weigh  its costs) (revoked  1993).  On the role  of cost-benefit balancing in  the courts,  see  Motor Vehicles
Mfrs.  Ass'n v. State  Farm Mutual  Auto. Ins., 463  U.S. 29, 54-55 (1983)  (endorsing cost-benefit  analysis
for automobile  safety  standards regarding automatic  seatbelt  systems); Corrosion  Proof Fittings v.  EPA,
947  F.2d  1201,  1215-17 (5th  Cir. 1991)  (rejecting  EPA's ban on asbestos  because  EPA failed  to adhere
to its statutory  mandate  to  impose  the least  burdensome  solution).  On  state and local  government,  see

tion and  the prospects  for  cost-benefit  balancing.5  Finally,  the  House passed
and  the  Senate  debated  measures that,  if enacted,  would  have  represented  the
largest  changes  to  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act6  since  its  enactment  in
1946.

By  the  close  of the  first  session,  however,  relatively  little  had  happened.
There  was no constitutional  transformation for  a simple reason:  The public has
not  (yet)  called  for  one  in  the  way that  American  institutions  require.  To be
sure,  the  House  passed  eleven  major  pieces  of legislation  in  two  months-
including  the Congressional Accountability  Act,7 the Line Item Veto  Act s  and
the  Unfunded  Mandates  Reform  Act.9  But  only  six  of those  measures  were
enacted  into  law.  The  Balanced  Budget  Amendment 10  passed  the  House  but
faced  defeat  in the  Senate,  as  did  tax  legislation, welfare  reform,  a new crime
bill,  and term limits  legislation.  The Line  Item  Veto Act and  litigation reform
passed  the House  and  Senate  in  different forms,  but await the  work of confer-
ence  committees,  stalled in  the  case  of the line  item  veto by the  Republicans'
reluctance  to  give this  power  to  President  Clinton."

All  in  all, there  was  a great deal  of noise  and bluster-a  great  deal  of sig-
nalling-but  surprisingly  little  in  the way of concrete  results.  In the  end,  the
enacted measures  proved  modest and  mostly procedural.  The  apparently  more
ambitious  proposals  contained  some  good  features.  But many  of their  provi-
sions  were  crude,  unimaginative,  and  far  more  procedural  than  advertised.
Rather  than  reflecting  new  and  better  thinking  about  substantive  regulation,
these  provisions  represented  an  effort  to  clog  the  administrative  process  with
paperwork.  In  fact,  members  of Congress  sometimes  appeared  to  misunder-
stand the content of the very legislation they were  debating.  Congress  revealed
only  a partial  awareness  of the  recent  outpouring  of research  on regulation-
research  that  could have  produced  the basis not  only  for  fundamental  change,
but also  for a consensus  cutting (more or less) across  partisan  lines.  Congress'

LEGISLATIVE  FOREWORD

emphasis  on cost-benefit  analysis  showed  a healthy  appreciation  for  balancing
rather than absolutism;  but it was  only a  start.  Congress may well have  laid the
groundwork  for  future  developments.  But  because  of  its  own  institutional
weaknesses  and  the  system  of checks  and  balances-including  above  all  bi-
cameralism  and  the possibility  of presidential  veto-actual  changes  will take
more time.  As  a  practical  matter, these  institutional  weaknesses  significantly
hamper Congress'  ability to produce  a constitutional  moment  in the  context of
the modem  regulatory  state.

B.  Lessons

Both institutional  and  substantive  lessons will emerge  from this  article.  On
the  institutional  side,  I  claim  that  Congress  is  quite  ill-equipped  to  produce
sensible,  constitution-like  reform,  at  least  if it tries  to  offer  details.  With  re-
spect to  regulation,  a  group  of generalist  representatives-all  with  numerous
issues  to  address,  few with  particular  expertise  in  regulatory  law,  and  many
beholden  to  special  interests-is  not in  a position to  produce  desirable,  large-
scale  reforms, unless  it restricts itself to  generalities.  Such a group  is prone  to
sharp  internal  divisions  that  are  not subject  to  reasonable  mediation  without  a
good deal  of specialization  in regulation.  Indeed,  the task of producing  consti-
tution-like  change  in  the modem  state  is  far more  difficult  than  it was  in  the
New  Deal era.  It is easier to create a regulatory state than it is to dismantle one,
especially  in  an era  in which  every  industrialized  nation  is  committed  to  con-
trolling the  operation  of the marketplace.

These  skeptical  claims  about  Congress'  institutional  capacities  are  rein-
forced  by  recent  experience.  As  we  will  see,  the  104th  Congress  was  split
between two  different sets  of interests:  technocratic forces  seeking to discipline
agency  decisions  with better  policy  analysis  and  forces  of reaction  seeking  to
stop  agency  action  even  when  it would  improve  social  well-being.  There  is
thus an  interesting contrast  between  the performances  of Congress  and the  ex-
ecutive  branch.  Even  those who reject  President Clinton's  approach  to regula-
tion should recognize  that his administration has  shown far more  sophistication
and  creativity  in this  area than  Congress. 12  (The same  is true  for the  adminis-

trations  of Presidents  Reagan  and  Bush. 13)  The  executive  branch  has  been
highly  attuned  to  the  need  to  compare  costs  and  benefits,  to  attend  to  results
rather  than processes,  and to  enlist  the private  sector  in  engineering  least-cost
solutions.  Improvements  in  regulatory  performance  are  more  likely  to  come
from the executive than from  a Congress  saddled with its institutional  deficien-
cies.  Perhaps  Congress should give  substantial  discretion to administrators,  al-
lowing them  to design  appropriate regulatory  tools and perhaps  to  set priorities
as  well.14  Indeed  many current  problems  result from  statutes  that  either  pro-
duce  poor  incentives  or forbid more  imaginative,  cheaper,  and  more  effective
solutions-or  that  ban  cost-benefit  balancing  altogether.' 5

On the  substantive  side,  a  cost-benefit  state  may  well  be better  than what
we  now  have:  a  system  containing  both  economic  and  democratic  failures,
where  priorities  are  not set carefully  and where interest groups  wield  excessive
power  over  government.  Certainly  it  is  important  to provide  methods  for  as-
sessing regulatory  performance.  At least in principle,  some form  of cost-bene-
fit  analysis  could  simultaneously  promote  political  accountability  and
regulatory  efficiency.  In this  way,  it could  be part  of a system  of deliberative
democracy.  But any movement  toward  a cost-benefit  state should be accompa-
nied  by an  understanding  of the  importance  of public judgments  in regulatory
law,  the  limits  of the  criterion  of private  willingness  to  pay,  and  the  need  to

create  market  mechanisms  that  do  not place  excessive  informational  demands
on  government.

More  specifically, I  suggest  that a general  requirement  of cost-benefit  anal-
ysis  would  indeed  be  a  constitution-like  amendment,  and a  highly  undesirable
one,  if it  is  understood  in  the  most  ambitious  possible  way:  as  an  effort  to
ensure that all regulatory  statutes are  implemented by reference  to the principle
of economic  efficiency  based  on  the  criterion  of private  willingness  to  pay.
Regulatory  measures  have  diverse  foundations,  and  many  legitimate  statutes
are  not rooted  in  the  efficiency  criterion  at all.

If cost-benefit  analysis  is understood  more  modestly  as  an effort  to require
balancing  rather  than  absolutism,  it  is  a  good  idea  and  should  generally  be
required.  But  so  understood,  cost-benefit  analysis  can  be  specified  in  many
different ways.  Congress should give appropriate  guidance  so that agencies  can
make reasonable  rather  than unreasonable  specifications.  I offer  some  sugges-
tions  about  how  these  tasks  might  be  accomplished;  to  this  end  I  emphasize
qualitative  as  well as  quantitative  factors,  public judgments  about risk, and  the
highly  diverse  foundations  of regulatory  enactments.

This  article  comes  in  four  parts.  Part  I  examines  the  popular  shift in  the
perceived  role  of the national  government-a shift that may yet  culminate  in a
constitutional  moment.  Part  I  also  outlines  what  has  been  learned  thus  far
about regulation.  Part II  describes  what the  104th  Congress proposed  and  sum-
marizes  this  failed  constitutional  moment.  Part  III  explores  how  the principal
proposals  might be  improved.  Part IV  addresses  the future  of the  cost-benefit
state.

II.  THE  ATrACK  ON  THE  NEw  DEAL

A.  A  New  Constitutional Moment?

The New  Deal  was  of course  a substantial  reformation  of the  original  con-
stitutional  structure. 16 It qualifies  as a  substantial reformation  above all because
it refashioned  the three  basic  cornerstones  of that structure:  federalism,  checks
and  balances,  and  individual  rights. 17

In  the  1930s  the powers  of the  national  government  were  expanded  in  an
extraordinary way,  in  favor of a system that exercised  something close  to gen-
eral police powers.' 8  The  original understanding  of a sharply  constrained  cen-

tral  government  was  therefore  repudiated  by  the  nation.  There  were  simple
grounds  for  this repudiation.  First, state  autonomy seemed an obstacle  to dem-
ocratic  self-government,  not a crucial  part of it-especially in  the midst of the
Depression,  when  states  were  generally  perceived  as  ineffectual  entities  buf-
feted by private factions.  As  a result of the New Deal, state autonomy was very
different  in  1940  from what it had  been  in  1920.

Second,  the system of checks  and balances came  under  sharp  criticism.  To
many observers,  especially  during the Depression, that system seemed  dysfunc-
tional and anachronistic  in modem society. 19  Effective  businesses do  not oper-
ate through checks  and balances;  why should government  paralyze  itself in this
way?20  In response,  Congress  delegated  enormous  policymaking  power to  the
President  and  created  a  large  number  of powerful  executive  and  independent
agencies.2'  Crucially,  Congress  designed  these  agencies  to  limit  the  conse-
quences  of the  system  of checks  and  balances  by  allowing  a high  degree  of
administrative  autonomy.  Thus the new agencies  had  a large degree of discre-
tionary  authority  under  open-ended  statutory  standards.  They  also  combined
traditionally  separated  powers  of adjudication,  execution,  and  legislation.

These  institutional  shifts  resulted  from  a  critical  national judgment  made
during the Depression:  that individual  rights, properly conceived,  included not
merely  the  common  law  catalogue  of private  interests,  but  also  governmental
protection  against  many of the harms  and  risks  of a market  economy.  These
harms and  risks  included unemployment,  poverty,  malnutrition,  homelessness,
lack of education,  and hopelessness  as  a result  of disability.22  Indeed  the com-
mon law catalogue seemed  overprotective  as well  as underprotective,  for it was
unduly  solicitous  of private property.  The  common  law was  a regulatory  sys-
tem  enjoying  no  special  status;  it  should  be  evaluated  pragmatically  and  in
terms  of its  consequences  for  the  human  beings  subject  to  it.  Here  it often
seemed  to  fail.  Hence  the national  government  was  authorized to  engage  in a
wide  range  of redistributive  policies.

If the  New  Deal  qualifies  as  a  constitutional  moment,  it  is  because  of its
revolutionary  redefinition  of constitutional  commitments. 23  Indeed,  an  aston-
ishing feature of the New Deal was its relative  rapidity.  Many  changes  came in

32  (reviewing  ACKERMAN,  supra note  1).  The  idea of a constitutional  moment should,  I think, be  seen
as a metaphor, connoting  large-scale  change  spurred by popular wishes, rather than as a genuine  consti-
tutional  amendment.  Nor do  I intend  to  specify the  criteria for deciding  whether the  nation  has exper-

the brief period  from  1932  through  1936,  and were  clearly  supported  and  rati-
fied  by the public.  Such  rapid  change  was possible  partly because  it  is a  rela-
tively  simple  step  for  a  legislature  to  create  a  range  of  new  bureaucratic
institutions,  at least  if  the  legislature  does  not specify  each  agency's  duties  in
advance.  In fact,  the New Deal  entities  operated  with little  statutory guidance;
Congress  usually  contented  itself with  open-ended  delegations  of authority. 24
As  we  shall  see,  the relative  simplicity  of the New  Dealers'  task contrasts  dra-
matically with  the complexity  of the task faced  by the  104th Congress. 25  More-
over, in the early  1930s the public's  support for the New Deal was broader  and
deeper  than  public  support  for  fundamental  change  in  the  1990s-though  the
public  may  unite  behind  such  change  before  long.

The  New  Deal  reformation  served  as  the  foundation  for the basic  orienta-
tion  of the national  government  until the election  of President Ronald  Reagan.
One  development  during  that  period  has  been  of  special  importance: 
the
"rights  revolution"  of the  1960s  and  1970s,  which  reinforced  many New  Deal
tendencies  through  the creation  of a remarkable  array  of new agencies.  These
agencies  were designed  to protect against threats  to life, health,  and safety from
consumer  products,  workplaces,  and,  above  all,  to  protect  the  environment. 26
Economic  arguments  about  external harms  reinforced  claims  for new statutory
"rights."  Hence  this  period  saw  the creation  of the  Environmental  Protection
Agency,  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration,  the  Consumer
Protect  Safety Commission, the Council on Environmental  Quality, and several
other  administrative  agencies.

It  is  notable  that  during  both  the New  Deal  and  the  rights  revolution,  no
mechanism  was  created  to  evaluate  regulatory  performance.  No  system  as-
sessed  whether  agencies  were making things  better or worse.  In the New Deal,
any such system might have seemed peculiar  in light of the widespread  national
enthusiasm  for the  President  and  for the possibilities  of benign  administration.
In  addition,  cost-benefit  thinking  was  largely  foreign  to  political  actors,  and
hence cost-benefit  analysis  played little or no role in public  debate.  No mecha-
nism existed to  protect  against the possibility  that "government  failure"  would
replicate  "market  failure."

One  of the  most  striking  features  of the period  since  1980  has  been  sus-
tained national  criticism of the New  Deal  reformation.  In  light of the election
of the  104th  Congress,  this criticism  may well be  signalling the first genuinely
foundational  challenge  to American government  since the New Deal itself.  The
Contract with America clearly  suggested  that  large-scale  change  was  at issue.
It  is  worthwhile  to  pause  over  the  constitution-like  character  of recent  chal-
lenges  to  the current  governmental  structure.  Critics  often  suggest  that the na-

ienced  a constitutional  moment.  If the term  is seen  as  a metaphor, rather  than a  legal  term of art,  it is
sufficient  to work  from more  abstract and  intuitive  ideas of the sort  described  in the  text.

tional  government  has  far exceeded  the  appropriate  limits  of its  authority  and
argue  for  a return to  the original  structure.2 7  Many  assert  that  a devolution  of
power  to the  states would  promote both  democratic  and economic  goals;2 s  the
Unfunded Mandate  Reform Act and Congress'  recent interest in "block  grants"
for states  to  use  basically  as  they wish  reflect  this  criticism.2 9

In this way there is a wholesale  attack on the existing allocation  of authority
between  the  national  government  and  the  states.  But  "horizontal"  issues  of
government  structure  are  receiving  similar  attention.  Concerned  about  the  ex-
tent of policymaking  discretion given to regulatory  agencies,  many suggest that
Congress should  reassert  its constitutional  prerogatives  by narrowing  adminis-
trative discretion. 30  It is urged that the New Deal's enthusiasm for independent
bureaucracy,  and  for  a large  lawmaking  role  for executive  agencies,  should  be
revisited,  and  that  Congress  should make  the  fundamental  choices  of policy.
Finally,  and  perhaps  most  fundamentally,  pre-New  Deal  principles  of pri-
vate  right  have  enjoyed  a  rebirth  with  the  suggestion  that  modem  regulatory
programs  violate  liberty, rightly  conceived. 31  These  principles  play  a  signifi-
cant  part  in  current  debates,  as  reflected  in  arguments  in  favor  of removing
constraints  from  the marketplace  and imposing  new compensation  obligations
on  government. 32  Thus  the movement  for  deregulation  has  become  far  more
sweeping  than  it was  in the Reagan period.  The Takings  Clause has become  a
rallying cry  for  a new enthusiasm  for the protection  of private  property-chal-
lenging  such well-established  federal  programs  as  the Endangered  Species  Act
and  the  Federal  Water  Pollution  Control  Act's  protection  of wetlands.

Some  criticisms  of regulatory  performance  have  been  far  narrower  and
more  pragmatic  in  character,  focusing  less  on  basic  theory  and  more  on the
economic  consequences  of regulation.  It  is  here  that  cost-benefit  balancing,
accompanied  by risk analysis,  has  played  a  special  role.  As  I  have noted,  the
New Deal period was  accompanied by no mechanism for monitoring  regulatory
performance.  But it  is  now  suggested  that national  government  has  failed  to
perform  the  tasks  assigned  to  it  and  has  often  made  things  worse. 33  In  this

view,  there  is  no  suggestion  that  markets  are  ideal;  but  often  markets  work
better than the regulatory programs  designed  as  solutions.  Increasingly,  assess-
ment  of regulatory  performance  has  taken  the form  of cost-benefit  analysis. 34
If we  are  indeed in  the midst of a constitutional  moment, it began  with the
election  of President  Ronald  Reagan  and  was  spurred  by  the  dramatic  and
largely  unanticipated  shift in the  direction  and composition  of the  Congress  in
the  1994 elections.  The  Contract With America presented the electorate  with  a
set  of  promises  for  fundamental  reform.  The  importance  of  the  Contract
should not be understated,  for it helped to  organize  a formerly unruly House  of
Representatives  and  provided  public  benchmarks  against  which  the  House
would be measured.  It is clear that in the  104th  Congress, the House of Repre-
sentatives  acted in  a remarkably  rapid  and  sweeping  fashion,  offering  the  Sen-
ate  a chance  to  make  the most significant  changes  in  the national  government
since  the New Deal.  The  Senate  declined  the opportunity,  largely because  the
public  showed  its  uncertainty  about  such  far-reaching  change.  If the  nation
follows  the Senate's  course, the effort at constitutional revision will have failed.
But any  predictions  on this  count  are premature.  Let us  turn,  then,  away  from
theory and toward  more  pragmatic  issues involving the performance  of the reg-
ulatory  state.

B.  Post-New Deal Learning About Regulation

In  the  last decade,  something  very  close  to  a  consensus  has  emerged  on
some  of the  most  important  problems  in  existing  government  regulation.  If
government  were  to  act  on  this  consensus,  it  would  introduce  important
changes.  Those  changes  need not amount to  anything like a constitutional  mo-
ment;  here  we  are  not  speaking  of the  most basic  constitutional  commitments.
But the  changes would  be far from  a mere matter of tinkering.  The  consensus
has the  following  features.

1.  Government should engage in  better priority-setting.

As  we will  see, measurement  of costs  and benefits  can be highly  controver-
sial.  But  under  any  measure,  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  resources  for  risk
reduction  are  badly  allocated.3 5  As  much  as  $500  billion may  be  spent  each
year  on  regulation,3 6  and  of this  amount,  more  than  $130  billion  is  spent  on

ing  that  regulatory  agencies  created  to  protect  the  public often  succumb  to  interest  group  pressures).

environmental  protection alone.37  A recent study suggests that better allocation
of health  expenditures  could  save  60,000  additional  lives  at no  increased  cost,
and  that,  alternatively,  we  could  maintain  the  current  number  of lives  saved
with  $31  billion in  annual  savings.3 8

This  overall  spending  pattern  includes  serious  and  apparently  unjustified 39
asymmetries  in  life-saving  expenditures  among  the  areas  of  regulation.  For
example,  compare  transportation  safety  regulation,  which  costs  a  median  of
$56,000 per life-year  saved, to occupational  safety regulation, costing  a median
of $350,000  per  life-year  saved,  and  environmental  regulation,  costing  a  me-
dian of $4,200,000  per life-year saved. 40  These variations  are  compounded  by
variations  in  the  effectiveness  of safety  standards  within  each  area. 41  Annual
lives  saved  are highly variable.  In transportation,  the Federal  Aviation Admin-
istration's  seat  cushion  flammability  regulation  saves  thirty-seven  lives  each
year,  while the  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration's  passive  re-
straints/belts  regulation  saves  no  fewer  than  1,850  lives  annually;  in  occupa-
tional  safety,  OSHA's  hazard  communication  regulation  saves  200  lives  per
year,  OSHA's  oil  and  gas  well  service  regulation  saves  fifty  lives  per  year,
OSHA's grain dust regulation  saves  four lives per year,  and OSHA's  formalde-
hyde regulation  saves  0.010 lives  per year;  and in environmental  safety, EPA's
asbestos regulation  saves ten lives each year, while EPA's land disposal regula-
tion  saves  2.5  lives  per year.42

Of course  calculations  of costs and benefits  are  somewhat  speculative,  and
these  numbers  are  only  estimates.  But with better  allocation  of resources  and
more  deliberative  judgments,  much  could  be  improved.  Consider  Table  1,
which certainly does not capture  all relevant factors-it does not even  describe
total  benefits-but  which  is  at  least  highly  suggestive  of  poor  resource
allocations. 43

In  addition  to  this  apparently  inconsistent  structure,  the  goal  of achieving
sensible  priority-setting  is  undermined  by the  fact  that  agencies  have substan-
tially  different  standards  for  deciding  when  risks  are  large  enough  to  require

any  regulation  at  all.44  For example,  the International  Commission  on Radio-
logical  Protection  recommends  that  environmental  factors  be  regulated  when
calculated  to  cause  an  incremental  cancer  risk  of about  3  in  1000,  for  those
exposed  over  a  lifetime.  American  agencies  do  not  follow this  recommenda-
tion,  and national practices  are highly variable.  The Nuclear  Regulatory  Com-
mission  mandates  regulation  where  incremental  cancer risks  exceed  1 in  1000;
the  EPA does  so when  the risk exceeds  an acceptable  range  that varies  from  1
in  10,000  to  1 in  1,000,000.4 5  The FDA  set its  standard  at  1 in  1,000,000,  but
courts  have interpreted  the  Delaney Clause  to require  a  standard  of essentially
zero.46  OSHA  interprets  the  "significant  risk"  requirement  in  its  governing
statute  to mean that an  incremental  cancer risk of 1 in  1000  will initiate regula-
tion;4 7  labor  groups  have  sought  to  require  regulation  when  the  risk  is  1 in
1,000,000.  As we  will  see,  a  single  number  may  not  make  sense  in  light  of
different  contextual judgments. 48  But in  the face  of these  variations,  good pri-
ority-setting  is  unlikely.

2.  Government should favor flexible, market-based incentives rather

than rigid commands.

Too  often government  regulates  through rigid commands,  precluding indus-
tries  from  using  more  flexible  and  cost-effective  measures  that  achieve  the
same  goals.49  For  example,  in  air and  water  pollution  control,  the  rigid  "best
available  technology"  approach,50  which  mandates  control  technologies  for
hundreds or even thousands  of firms,  gives  industries little incentive  to improve
existing  pollution  control  technologies.  Incentive-based  systems  could  save
billions  of dollars. 51  Yet  in  spite  of the  potential  advantages,  efforts  to  seek
better  regulatory  tools  are  hobbled  by  the  statutory  status  quo,  which  either
forbids  such  tools or  engrafts  them  onto  a  bureaucratically  complex  system.52

LEGISLATIVE FOREWORD

A  study  based  on data from  1984  suggests  that the EPA's  "netting"  emissions
trading  program saves  between  $525  million and $12  billion each year.5 3  The
Clinton  Administration calculates  that its market-oriented  proposals  for amend-
ing the Clean Water Act could save between  $1 and $12  billion over alternative
approaches.5 4  Thus  studies  show that incentive-based  mechanisms  for  control-
ling  air  pollution  could  have  accomplished  the  same  result  at one-quarter  the
cost. 55

Encouraging  companies  to  disclose  information  is  an  especially  valuable
incentive-based  approach  to  risk  regulation.  If companies  offer  information
about  risk,  consumer  and  worker  behavior  will  probably  be  affected.5 6  The
national government  has offered  many initiatives  in this  direction.  Consider in
particular  the  Toxic  Release  Inventory  of the  Superfund  Amendments,  which
requires  companies  to  publish  annual  reports  detailing  the  amount  of toxics
they  release  into  the  environment.  This  program  has  been  highly  successful,
spurring voluntary  reductions  at relatively  low  costs.  Reacting  to  public  con-
cern  about  the  information  in  these  mandatory  disclosures,  many  companies
have  voluntarily  pledged  to  reduce  toxic  releases. 57  A  great  deal  of work re-
mains  to  be  done  in  conceiving  and  designing  appropriate  informational  ap-
proaches  to  risk.5 8

3.  Government should recognize and counteract harmful unintended

consequences of regulations.

Many  regulatory  initiatives  result  in  harmful  unintended  consequences.
Under the existing regulatory  system, there  is no  systematic  way to  ensure that
those  consequences  receive  attention.5 9  Hence  regulation  tends  to be based  on
partial perspectives  that emerge  from close attention to mere pieces of complex
problems.  This  myopic approach ignores  the importance of ensuring that regu-
lation  does  not have unexplored  side-effects  or increase  harms or risks  on bal-

[Vol. 48:247

ance.60  A particular  problem arises  from  "health-health"  tradeoffs,  which arise
when  regulation of one health risk increases another health risk.61  Suppose,  for
example, that elimination  of asbestos, a carcinogenic  substance, makes  cars less
safe because  asbestos  is the best substance to use in making brake linings. 62  Or
suppose that the ban  on asbestos  encourages  companies  to use  even more  dan-
gerous  substitutes. 63  It  is  pervasively  true  that  controls  on  one  risk may  in-
crease  another  risk.  Unfortunately,  risk  regulation  is  not  designed  with  this
problem  in  mind.

An incipient literature  deals with a related  issue.  It suggests that regulatory
expenditures  can  profoundly  affect  social  well-being  and  actually  cost health
and  even  lives.  Regulatory  expenditures  may produce  greater  unemployment
by  increasing  production  costs  and  decreasing  profits.  Unemployment  breeds
poverty,  which,  in  turn,  breeds  poor  health  and  increased  mortality  rates.  A
1990  study developed  a model  to quantify the common sense  view that "richer
is  safer."' 4  The  study  suggests  that  a regulatory  expenditure  of $3 million  to
$7.5  million may  cause  a  statistical  fatality.65

In  a concurring  opinion  in  a  1991  D.C.  Circuit  case involving  an  occupa-
tional  safety  and  health  regulation,  Judge  Williams  invoked  this  evidence  to
suggest  that  OSHA's  refusal  to  engage  in  cost-benefit  analysis  might  not  be
beneficial  for workers. 66  Judge Williams  reasoned that if a fatality results from
an  expenditure  of $12  million, some  regulations  might produce more fatalities
than they prevent. 67  As Table I  illustrates,  many regulations  do cost more than
$12  million  per  life  saved.  In  Judge  Williams'  view,  an  agency  that  fails  to
measure  the  overall  social  costs  against  benefits  falls  accurately  to  measure
mortality  gains  against losses.

60.  What constitutes  an "increase"  depends  not  merely on quantitative  considerations  but also  on

normative  judgments.  See text accompanying  notes  74-88  infra.

[Vol.  48:247

This  work  is  in  its  initial  stages,  and  any  findings  should  be  taken  with
many grains  of salt.70  But certainly  it would be  good for government  to  know
about unintended  adverse  consequences  and  to  try  to  counteract  them  to  the
extent  feasible.  Unfortunately,  there  is  now  no  systematic  mechanism  by
which  government  regulators  are  made  attentive 
to  harmful  unintended
consequences.

4.  Government needs more  information and should create better
incentives to compile and provide accurate information.

Often  government  lacks  information  about  the  harms  that  regulation  is
designed  to counteract.  Often it must act, or fail to  act, in a context  of consid-
erable  scientific uncertainty. 7 1  Without accurate  data, any exercise  in  quantifi-
cation  can  be  illusory,72  giving  the  impression  of far  more  knowledge  than
people  actually  have.

In these circumstances  government  should place  a high premium on  acquir-
ing as  much  accurate  information  as  possible.  Much  of the relevant  informa-
tion  can  be  found  in  the private  sector,  which  is  best  equipped  to  determine
actual emissions  levels and the costs  of risk control.  But the current regulatory
structure does not create incentives  to compile accurate  information about risks.
Indeed,  it creates  incentives to distort the facts.  Hence  industry faces incentives
to  report  costs that  are  far higher than  reality73  and is not  encouraged to  com-
pile  more  information  than  is  already  available.

5.  Government should respond to  both expert and citizen judgments in

regulating risks.

It  seems  clear  that  government  should  respond  to  reasonable  judgments
about  risk;  but whose judgments  should  be counted  as  reasonable?  Countless
studies  show  systematic  differences  between  expert  and  citizen  judgments
about  risk.7 4  This  is  one  of the  most  robust  findings  in  an  extensive  litera-

70.  See  Portney  &  Stavins, supra note  37,  at  118-19  (advocating  use  of cost-benefit  analysis

A  recent study  in Canada  shows  similar  results.77  It reveals  that the  Cana-
dian public  sees  cigarette  smoking and motor vehicle  accidents  as  far less  dan-
gerous  than  do  Canadian  toxicologists.  It  also  shows  that  the  public  ranks
many risks higher than do toxicologists;  the most dramatic disparities along this
dimension involve chemical  pollution, ozone  depletion, nuclear waste,  food ad-
ditives,  pesticides  in  goods,  and  PCBs.

What accounts  for  these  differences?  Some  are  simply  attributable  to  citi-
zens'  ignorance  of scientific facts.  This  ignorance  has  many sources,  including
sensationalist  media  reports  and  heuristics  that  produce  systematic  biases. 78

For example,  people tend to think that an event is more  likely when it is "avail-
able,"  that is,  when previous  occurrences  can  come readily  to mind.79  Perhaps
it is for  this  reason  that people  believe  that deaths  from  accidents  occur  much
more  often  than deaths  from disease,  when  in fact  disease claims  fifteen  times
as  many lives. 80  The  availability  heuristic  suggests  also  that the public's  risk
assessment  will be partly an artifact of what the media emphasize.  Notably, the
media  tend  to  emphasize  unusual  and  provocative  events  rather  than  chronic
risks.81  The result is substantial distortions in policy, reflected in the "pollutant
of the  month"  syndrome  that  characterizes  many regulatory  responses.8 2

When citizens  are misinformed,  government  should not base regulatory  de-
cisions  on  their judgments.8 3  Instead,  government  should  act  on the  basis  of
scientific  realities.  Public  judgments  should  dictate  regulatory  policy  only
when they  are undergirded  by sound science, as  opposed to  sensationalist anec-
dotes  or  scare  tactics. 84  This  is  part  of the  defining  creed  of a  deliberative
democracy.  Too  often,  however,  the  scare  tactics  have  prevailed. 85

But the misguided fears  of citizens  provide  only part of the  story.  Some  of
the  differences  between  citizens'  and  experts'  assessments  of  risks  involve
value judgments  rather  than  factual  misunderstandings.  Experts  focus  princi-
pally  on aggregate  lives at stake.  By contrast,  citizens  consider a range  of other
variables:  whether risks  are  equitably distributed,  likely  to be  faced  by  future
generations,  especially  dreaded, well-understood,  or voluntarily incurred.8 6  Ta-
ble  4  summarizes  psychological  research  on the  effect of value judgments  on
risk  perceptions.

Qualitative  distinctions  of this kind do not play a role in most expert  assess-
ments.  But citizen judgments  on these  points  are  entirely reasonable.  So long
as  those judgments  are  both reflective  and  informed,8 7 they deserve  respect. 88
Any regulatory  reform  should reflect  these  qualitative  public judgments  about
which risks  are  most  severe.

6.  Government should concentrate on  basic ends rather than means

and should use performance standards rather than
design standards.

Regulatory  policy  often  deteriorates  into  an arena  for interest-group  strug-
gle.  This  happened  most  famously with  efforts  in  1977  to  use  the  Clean  Air
Act to  promote the interests  of eastern  coal89  and, in  1990,  with interest-group
lobbying  on behalf of ethanol  producers  and  other parochial interests. 90  Inter-
est-group  maneuvering  is an  omnipresent  issue in federal  regulation,  especially
when the  issue  is the  "means"  of promoting regulatory  goals.

Government  can  limit  interest-group  power,  and  at the  same  time  reduce
costs, by focusing legislative  attention on ends rather than  on means  of achiev-

account  of  "many  other  dimensions  of  risk  that  are 
important  psychologically,  ethically,  and
politically").

88.  It is not,  however,  always  simple  to distinguish  between  irrational judgments  resulting  from
sensationalism  and  legitimate  public  value  judgments.  For example,  synthetic  risks  receive  far more
attention  than natural risks  in public judgments.  This pattern tends to explain many apparent anomalies
in federal  risk  regulation,  as synthetic  risks  are more frequently  and more  severely regulated.  See W.
Kip Viscusi, supra note 86, at 51-52.  Viscusi suggests that this perception reflects  "bias" and "overreac-
tion." Id. at 54.  Perhaps it does.  But it is  not a simple  computational mistake,  and it does not reflect,  in
any obvious  way, a misunderstanding of facts.  Perhaps citizens are making judgments  about which risks
deserve priority.

ing those  ends.  For this  reason,  "performance  standards"  are  generally  better
than "design  standards." 9 1  When a legislature  is  discussing  "means"--ethanol,
electric  cars,  water pollution  control mechanisms-well-organized  groups  will
see  that  the  choice  can  provide  large  competitive  benefits  (or  impose  large
competitive  burdens).  Hence  the choice  of means  invites  interest-group  strug-
gle  with  a  public-spirited  veneer.  After  all,  what  matters  to  the  public  is
whether  the  level  of emissions  is  low or  high,  not whether  the  relevant  com-
pany has  installed  specific  scrubbers.

In general, Congress  should let administrators  decide the appropriate means
for reaching  legislatively chosen  ends,  and  administrators  should,  to  the extent
feasible,  rely  on market  forces  in  selecting  those  means.  For  example,  if an
industry  can  comply  with  a  sulfur  dioxide  emission  standard  by  either  using
clean  coal  or implementing  energy  conservation  methods,  government  should
not command  a particular  method  of compliance. 92  Industry will  understanda-
bly  choose  a  method  that is  cheapest.

These,  then,  are  the  principal  lessons  of the  last generation  of experience
with  regulation:  government  should  set  better  priorities  for  risk  regulation;
favor  flexible, market-based  incentives;  establish  mechanisms  to counteract  un-
intended, harmful  consequences;  create  incentives  to encourage  the private  sec-
tor  to  compile  risk  data;  account  for  public  and  expert  judgments;  and  use
performance  standards  rather  than  design  standards.  In view of these  lessons,
we  might  conclude  that  it  is  well  past time  to  enact  an  "Administrative  Sub-
stance  Act."  The  point  of such  an  act would  be  to  capture  new learning  with
respect to regulatory  successes  and  failures.  Though  the Administrative  Proce-
dure  Act has been successful  in many  ways, it reflects the lawyer's  characteris-
tic  preoccupation  with  procedural  regularity  rather  than  with  substantive
outcomes.  An Administrative  Substance  Act  would  track  the  important  ques-
tion:  Does regulation  actually  make  things  better  for  citizens?

91.  Recent  initiatives  in the area  of occupational  safety and health reflect this point.  See Remarks
on the National  Performance  Review,  31  WEEKLY  Comp.  PRES.  Doc.  838,  840  (May  16,  1995)  (urging
modification  of detailed  regulatory  standards  in  favor of greater  flexibility);  see also Memorandum  on

THE  DEATH  OF  COMMON  SENSE:  How  LAW  Is  SUFFocATING  AMERICA  (1994)  (criticizing  regulations
that  do  not permit  common  sense judgment).

92.  The Clean Air Act Amendments  of 1990 made some progress  in this direction. See, e.g., Clean
Air  Act Amendments  of 1990  ยง 401,  42  U.S.C.  ยง 7651(b)  (Supp. V  1993)  (setting  numerical  goals for

LEGISLATIVE  FOREWORD

III.  REGULATORY  REFORM  AND  THE  104TH  CONGRESS:  A  FAILED  EFFORT
AT  FUNDAMENTAL  CHANGE

9 3

Substantive  regulatory  issues  are hardly new  to Congress.  Recent  congres-
sional  sessions  have  devoted  significant  attention  to  substantive  regulatory  re-
form,  usually on  a statute-by-statute  basis. 94  In  1990,  for  example,  Congress
enacted  a  set of major  changes  to  the Clean Air  Act.95  Changes  to  the  (disas-
trous 9 6 )  Superfund  statute97  and  the  Federal  Water  Pollution  Control  Act 98
have received  considerable  attention  in  recent  years  as  well.

But the  104th  Congress  sought something different-far  more fundamental
and less piecemeal  change, challenging the basic  foundations of our legal  order,
reappraising the welfare  and taxation  systems, and reassessing federalism  in the
context  of the  modem  state. 99  And  after the  1994  elections,  it was  clear  that
regulatory  reform  would  be  an  important  legislative  priority.  Perhaps  this  re-
form  would  launch  a  basic  assault  on  the  regulatory  state  and  indeed  on the
New  Deal  reformation  of American  public  law.

Note, however,  that the  104th  Congress  faced  a far more  difficult and  com-
plex task than did the New Dealers.  This  is not only because  the nation has not
unambiguously  endorsed  such fundamental  change.  It is also because  there is a
difference  between the elaborate project  of reforming existing programs  and the
relatively  simple  creation  of new bureaucracies  acting  under  vague  statutory
guidance.  Under  current  conditions,  the  task  of fundamental  reform  calls  for
far more numerous  and far harder judgments,  especially  at the legislative  level.
Understanding  this  problem,  members  of the  104th  Congress  introduced  a
truly remarkable array of proposed legislation.10 0  In the regulatory  arena, cost-
benefit  balancing  dominated  the  debate.  As  we  shall  see,  the  notion  of cost-
benefit  assessment  is quite open-ended;  everything  depends on the relevant the-
ory of valuation.  But  there is an unmistakable  general  trend in  the direction  of

evaluating  government  performance  in  cost-benefit  terms.  This  development
may  ultimately  help  organize  and incorporate  recent  learning  about  regulatory
performance.10 1

A.  The  Contract and Two  Kinds of Supermandates

The Contract with America expressly addresses  government regulation,  and
it promises  prompt action.  In an especially  good paragraph,  one that  deserves
bipartisan  endorsement,  the  Contract states:

Congress  is never forced to ensure  that the benefits of regulation,  better health
and  productivity,  outweigh  the  costs,  lost jobs,  and lower  wages.  Nor  does
Congress pursue  integrated  health  and safety goals.  Instead,  Congress and fed-
eral regulators  often attack  whatever  health risk  has caught the public's  atten-
tion,  even  if its regulatory  solution  exacerbates  other health  risks.102
The  Contract promised  several  concrete  steps,  including:  (a) risk  assess-
ment  for expensive  regulations;  (b)  a statement  of the  costs  accompanying reg-
ulatory  initiatives;  (c)  a  comparison  of  costs  and  benefits  to  accompany
regulations;  (d) an independent peer review panel to certify the risk assessment;
and (e)  an annual  report  detailing  a regulatory  budget, to  be  capped  below the
current  level.  This  cap  would  require  agencies  to  find  cost-effective  mecha-
nisms  and  identify  policies  whose  benefits  exceed  their  costs. 10 3  Taken  to-
gether,  these  steps  may  or may not  qualify  as  constitutional  in  character;  but
they certainly  would  amount  to  a  large-scale  revision of current  practice.

We  might  distinguish  at  this  point  between  two  different  possible  super-
mandates-requirements  that cut across  all regulatory  statutes  and that, in this
sense,  operate  like  constitutional  amendments.  A  substantive supermandate
enacts  new decisional  criteria that  agencies must henceforth follow.  A general
requirement  of  cost-benefit  balancing  would  fall  within  this  category,  espe-
cially if cost-benefit  balancing  is  defined with a degree  of precision.  Similarly,
a general  ban on regulation  of insignificant risks is a substantive supermandate.
A procedural supermandate is  a provision  that requires  all  agencies  to  follow
new procedures,  going  beyond  the  APA  and  organic  statutes.  The  Contract
emphasizes  procedural  supermandates;  but  its call  for  cost-benefit  comparison
moves  in  the  direction  of substance.

The  Contract was  of course  the focus  of sustained legislative  attention,  es-
pecially  in  the  House.  In  the  Congress  as  a  whole,  there  was  much  debate
about the  unnecessarily high  costs  of regulation,  the need for better regulatory
tools,  and  the  value  of balancing  rather  than  absolutism.

Before  discussing  the  details,  it  is  important  to  say  that  there  were  two
overarching  strands  in  the  reform  efforts.  The  first  strand  was  technocratic.
Here  the  reformers'  goal  was  to bring  to  bear  the best  in  the way  of sophisti-
cated  policy  analysis,  so  as  to  ensure  better  priority-setting  and  attention  to
consequences.  Some  of the  provisions  governing  risk  analysis,  cost-benefit

LEGISLATIVE  FOREWORD

balancing,  and  the use  of market-based  tools  reflected  the  technocratic  strand.
Those enthusiastic  about some  forms of regulation  should endorse  these provi-
sions.1ยฐ4 Indeed,  the introduction into Congress of sophisticated  learning about
risk regulation  was  the most impressive  feature  of the debate.

The second  and much  less  attractive  strand is best described  as reactionary.
Here the goal was to  stall or eliminate regulation  whatever  its content-largely
with  procedural  requirements  so  extensive  as  to  prevent  agencies  from  doing
much  at all.  The  reactionary  strand  can  be  found  in  moratorium  provisions,
provisions  calling  for  multiple  rounds  of judicial  review,  and  above  all  "look
back"  provisions  allowing judicial  review  of agency  failure  to  revise  existing
rules.  In the  104th  Congress,  a special  irony  can  be found  in  the  combination
of proposals  for extensive and costly procedural  and analytic  requirements  with
proposals  for  dramatic  decreases  in  appropriations,  which  would  make  it  far
more  difficult  for  agencies  to  comply  with new legislative  requirements.  The
reactionary  strand  is also  ill-considered  insofar  as efforts  to  slow down  or stop
regulations  will prevent  agencies  from engaging in many current  efforts to  ease
regulatory  burdens  through  new,  more  flexible  initiatives.' 05

Of course  the  technocratic  and  reactionary  strands  could  make  some  alli-
ances.  Good technocrats  believe  that  overregulation  is  indeed  a problem,  and
good  reactionaries  understand  that technical  tools  can  limit unjustified  regula-
tory  interventions.  But  the  alliance  was  bound  to  produce  difficulties,  since
those  interested  in  technical  improvements  are  unlikely  to  support  measures
that would drown  agencies  in paperwork requirements  or increase their vulner-
ability to  special  interests.

For its part, the opposition to the reform  efforts  also contained  two contrast-
ing  approaches.  To  paint  with  a  broad  brush:  Moderate  forces,  enthusiastic
about  policy  analysis,  attempted  to  counter  or  eliminate  the  reactionary  ele-
ments  in reform  proposals while  endorsing the technocratic  elements.  By con-
trast,  those we  might  describe  as  status  quo  defenders  treated  existing  statutes
as if they actually made  a great deal of sense and were working well;  their goal
was  to  protect as  much  as  possible  of the existing  administrative  state.  As  we
shall  see,  the  Clinton  Administration  mostly  belonged  in  the  former  camp,  at
least  in  its  public  pronouncements.

B.  Particulars

1.  Unfunded mandates.

On  March  22,  1995,  Congress  enacted  the  Unfunded  Mandates  Reform
Act,10 6 which bans  Congress from mandating  state action without appropriating
federal  resources.  The Act  also  contains  several  provisions directly relevant  to
the  subject  of regulatory  reform.  Surprisingly,  these  "sleeper"  provisions  re-
ceived  almost  no  public  attention  and  escaped  mention  during  the  legislative
debates  over the basic regulatory reform bills.  This fact says a great deal about
the possibility  of legislative  coordination  of statutory reforms.  If a single  Con-
gress  is unable  to  coordinate  these  few reforms  over  a six-month  period,  gen-
eral  coordination  of statutes  enacted  in  different periods  seems  unlikely.

The Unfunded  Mandates  Reform Act  contains two notable provisions relat-
ing to  regulatory  reform;  both grow  out of the  Contract With America.  First,
the  Act requires  that  "a  qualitative  and  quantitative  assessment  of the  antici-
pated costs  and benefits  of the Federal mandate"' 1 7 accompany  significant reg-
ulatory  action  (those that would  cost more  than  $100  million  annually).  This
assessment  must also  include:  (1) a statement of future  compliance  costs;  (2) a
description  of any  disproportionate  budgetary  effects  on  particular  regions  or
segments  of the private  sector;  and  (3) estimates  of the effect  of its  action "on
the national economy, such as the effect on productivity, economic  growth, full
employment,  creation  of productive jobs,  and  international  competitiveness  of
United  States  goods and  services,"  if accurate  estimates  are  "reasonably  feasi-
ble"  and  the  effect  is  "relevant  and  material."' 0 8

This  provision  is  largely  procedural;  it  counts  as  a modest  kind  of proce-
dural  supermandate.  It probably will not make much  of a  difference.  President
Clinton's  Executive  Order  on  Federal  Regulation' 0 9  imposes  nearly  identical
requirements,  and while  the  Order  is not  subject to judicial  review,  the  "hard
look"  doctrine  imposes  requirements  roughly parallel  to  those  of the Act." 0

The second  noteworthy provision  is more  ambitious.  It requires  that  agen-
cies  "identify  and  consider  a reasonable  number  of regulatory alternatives  and
from those  alternatives  select the  least costly,  most cost-effective  or  least bur-
densome  alternative  that achieves  the  objectives  of the  rule."' 1  The  Act  ex-
empts  agencies  from these  requirements  if compliance  would  be  inconsistent
with  the  law  or  if the  agency  explains  its  reason  for  not  selecting  the  least
burdensome  alternative." 2

LEGISLATIVE  FOREWORD

Despite  this  exemption,  the provision  could have  significant  consequences.
In many cases  it is  questionable  whether  an  agency  has  chosen the  most cost-
effective  means  of accomplishing  regulatory goals.  As  we  have  seen, flexible,
market-based  incentives  may  achieve  those  goals  at much  less  expense  than
command-and-control  alternatives. 11 3  While  the  provision  may  result  in  con-
siderable  litigation  about  whether  existing  statutes  forbid  its  approach,  it pro-
vides  an  opportunity  for  extensive  rethinking  of  existing  regulatory  tools.
Agencies may well be required  to use economic  incentives where  they now use
technological  requirements.  The  provision  is  not,  however,  a  genuine  super-
mandate  because  it does  not apply if other statutes  prohibit  agencies  from fol-
lowing  it.

To  the  extent  that the Act  encourages  agencies  to  choose  cheaper  ways  of
achieving  regulatory  goals,  it  may  be  a  modest  improvement  on  the  current
situation.  With these  two  provisions,  the Unfunded  Mandates  Reform  Act of-
fers  cautious  steps  in  the  direction  of a  general  requirement  of  cost-benefit
balancing.

2.  Moratorium and legislative review.

House  Bill 450, the Regulatory Transition Act of 1995,114 proposed  a mora-
torium banning  all federal  regulatory rulemaking, with certain  exemptions,  dur-
ing  a specified  period.  The  period  was  scheduled  to  begin on November  20,
1994,  and to  end at the  earlier of two  dates:  December 31,  1995,  or the  day on
which  a general  regulatory reform  bill was  enacted.I' s  On February 24,  1995,
House  Bill  450  was  passed  by a vote  of 276  to  146.116

In the Senate,  however, the prospects  for House Bill 450 were  poor, and for
good reason.  Though  popular  in recent years,'  17 a general  moratorium on fed-
eral  regulation  is  reactionary  in  the  worst  way-a  crude,  lazy,  and pandering
response  to  current  problems.  Its  blunderbuss  quality  ensures  that  it will  stop
measures that are  otherwise  required  by law, or that would  do a lot of good,  as
well  as  measures  that  warrant  reconsideration  (which  a moratorium  by  itself
fails  to  provide).  A  special  problem  is  that  the  moratorium  would  apply  to
measures  designed  to  relieve  businesses of expenses  and obligations;  from the
standpoint  of business,  a  moratorium  is  only  a mixed  blessing.11 8  In short,  a
moratorium  falls to make  distinctions  that public officials  ought to make.  Thus
the moratorium  idea never  received  sustained  attention  in  the  Senate.

But on March 29,  1995,  the Senate  passed what  it self-consciously  consid-
ered an alternative:  Senate  Bill 219, which requires  agencies  to  submit all reg-
ulations  to  Congress  and  gives  Congress  an  opportunity  to  "veto"  any  rule

9  On April 7,  1995,  President Clin-
through the normal process  of lawmaking.'  '
ton threatened  to veto  the  moratorium  proposal,120  but specifically  voiced  en-
thusiasm for the Senate bill.12 1  On May  17,  1995,  the House  passed Senate  Bill
219  by  voice  vote. 122  As  of early  December,  however,  no  bill had  emerged
from  the  conference  committee  or been  submitted  to  the President.

3.  Generic reform, supermandates, and APA  amendments: the House.

By far the most important, and the most sharply contested,  of the regulatory
reform  proposals  involved  so-called  generic  proposals,  representing  the  most
important  changes  to the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  since  its enactment  in
1946-a  modest constitutional  moment unto  themselves.  The principal  theme
in  public  debate  involved  the  need  for  cost-benefit  balancing;  but procedural
supermandates  played  an  enormous  role  as well.

It is important to say here that regulatory reformers  in the House and  Senate
argued  in  favor  of a  supermandate  to  be  applied  to  a  wide  range  of statutes.
But the Clinton  Administration, along  with several  others,  urged instead a stat-
ute-by-statute  approach,  in  which  any  changes  would  be  based  on  a  careful
inquiry into  the particular  statute.' 23  On this view,  Congress would  investigate
the  Clean  Air  Act,  the  Clean  Water  Act,  the  Delaney  Clause,  and  so  forth,
rather  than  changing  the  law  through  generic  reform.  There  were  plausible
arguments  on  both  sides.  Perhaps  particular  statutes  raise  special  considera-
tions  best addressed  by intensely focusing  on their particular  features.  Perhaps
any  generic  reform  would  be  too crude  and  too  ill-informed.' 24

On  the  other hand,  reformers  might urge,  with some justification,  that  ge-
neric  reform  would  have  some  of the  virtues  of across-the-board  tax  reform,
base-closing  legislation,  and the  Gramm-Rudman  Act.  That is,  generic  reform
might  prevent  well-organized  interest  groups  from  mobilizing  in  the  intense
way they can on specific  statutes, thus  defeating  reform.  Generic reform would

they  take  effect  would  let  lawmakers  focus  on  the  specifics  of these  issues  and  address  real
problems  as they come  up, without  delaying  necessary public  protections.  This approach,  not
the  blunt  instrument  of a  moratorium,  is  the  right  way  to  reform  regulation.  It's  common
sense.

LEGISLATIVE  FOREWORD

allow  legislators  to  assemble  otherwise  diffuse  and  ill-organized  public  inter-
ests  in  support  of general  change;  it  would  prevent  Congress  from becoming
enmeshed  in the self-interested struggles  that emerge when particular  members,
with strong particular  interests, are  asked to  change particular legislation;  and it
would  embolden legislators  to act responsibly  because  a wide range  of interest
groups  would be  at risk  at the  same time,  and thus be  unable to  argue that  any
one of them had  been singled out for  special  adverse treatment.  The  reformers
seem to  have  the better  of the  argument,  at least  so  long  as  the supermandate
has  sufficient  flexibility.  Now let us  turn to  the  details.

The  generic  reform  bill  in  the  House,  House  Bill  1022,  was  referred  to
House  committees  on  February  23,  1995.125  Championed  by  Representative
David MacIntosh,  this bill contained  a wide range  of requirements.  The princi-
pal provisions  would  have imposed:

(1)  a requirement  of careful  risk assessment  to  accompany  new regulations;
(2)  a  system  of peer  review  for risk  assessments,  with  a  specific  provision
allowing "peers"  with a potential financial  stake to participate  on peer review
panels;
(3)  a codification  of President  Reagan's  Executive  Order  on federal  regula-
tion,  including  the  requirement  that regulations  be  cost-effective  and  favor
least  restrictive  alternatives;1 2 6
(4)  a general,  ambiguous but apparent requirement  of cost-benefit balancing,
including  perhaps  a  substantive  supermandate  to  amend  all  statutes  that  do
not require  or permit  cost-benefit  balancing;' 2 7
(5)  a compensation  requirement  for any  government action that  reduces  the
value  of property by more  than ten  percent;  and
(6)  a regulatory  budget.
This  was  a  remarkably  ambitious  piece  of legislation,  with many ambigui-
ties and  many provisions  that warranted  and  continue  to warrant  sustained dis-
cussion.  For  example,  a  general  requirement  of cost-benefit  balancing  would
amend  many  substantive  statutes.  Certainly  it  would  be  wise  to  explore  the
precise  consequences  of these amendments.  As  we will see, the issue became  a
central  subject of dispute  in the  Senate.

A  compensation  requirement  for  any  reduction  in  property  values  of ten
percent  or more  raises  even  more  complex  issues.  Such  a requirement  would
be unprecedented,  and its consequences  are  far from  clear.  The major problem
with  such a requirement  is that  it may  deter valuable  projects  from  going  for-

127.  H.R.  1022 incorporated  by reference  President  Reagan's  Executive  Order on Federal Regula-
tion, Exec. Order No.  12,291, supra note 2.  The  ambiguity stems,  in part, from the fact that the require-
ments  of that  executive  order-including  the  requirement  that  cost-benefit  analysis  be  the  basis  for
decision-applied  only "to  the  extent permitted by  law."  Id.  This qualification  recognizes  that  some
statutes  prohibit cost-benefit analysis.  Since  H.R.  1022,  if enacted,  would be a statute,  the effect  of the
"to  the extent  permitted by  law"  qualification  is  unclear.

ward.  The  government  does  not  extract  a  benefit  whenever  its  regulations
cause  an increase  in property  values, and in view  of the expense  of administer-
ing  a  "ten percent  or more"  compensation  requirement,  a requirement  that  the
government  compensate the relevant losers might create  incentives  not to intro-
duce  desirable  regulations.  To  know  whether  the  compensation  requirement
makes  sense, it  is necessary to  develop  a concrete  understanding  of its  effects.
To  how many regulations  would  it  apply?  What  effects  would  it have  on the
treasury?  Would it deter government  significantly?  If so, would the deterrence
be  optimal  or excessive?  Extensive  procedural requirements  delaying  and  de-
terring the "reinventing  government"  initiatives  as  well as  everything  else,  also
raise  many hard  issues.1 28

Remarkably, the House held no hearings on these and other questions, pass-
ing House Bill  1022  on February  28,  1995-just five days  after its reference  to
committees-by the  overwhelming vote  of 286 to  141.129  This  was  irresponsi-
ble;  it reflected  the power  of forces  of reaction  in the  House, which  had prom-
ised  to act  in one  hundred  days.  The  only possible justification  for the  speedy
passage would  be  to spur  the  Senate to  act  in a more deliberative  fashion.  On
April  7,  1995,  President  Clinton  said  that  he  would  veto  the  compensation
requirement. 130

On  March  9,  the  House  referred  to  the  Senate  House  Bill  9,131  a  closely
overlapping  bill.132  Perhaps  its key provision  was  section  422,  which outlined
the criteria  to be  satisfied  before  a final rule  is promulgated.  The  most impor-
tant  of these  criteria  included  requirements  (a) "[t]hat  the  incremental  risk  re-
duction  or other benefits  of any strategy  chosen  will be likely to justify,  and be
reasonably  related  to,  the  incremental  costs  incurred" 133  and  (b)  "[t]hat  other
alternative  strategies  identified  by the agency  were  found  either  (A) to  be  less
cost-effective..,  or (B) to provide less flexibility." 134  These decisional  criteria
are  supposed  to  "supplement  and,  to  the  extent  there  is  a  conflict,  supersede"
the  otherwise  applicable  decision criteria.' 35

H.R.  9  also  contains  the  "Private Property Protection  Act  of 1995,"  requir-
ing  compensation  for  any  diminution  of the  fair  market  value  of property  by
20% or more, 136 and the "Regulatory  Reform and Relief Act," requiring a com-
plex  regulatory  impact  analysis-including  discussions  of costs  and  benefits
and  market-based  alternatives-and  increased  hearing  requirements  in  notice
and  comment rulemaking. 137  It would  include  as  well  the  "Risk Management

and Cost-Benefit Act  of 1995,"  designed to promote careful  risk analysis pursu-
ant to  detailed  standards. 138

4.  Generic reform:  the Senate.

House  Bills  1022  and  9  were  never  introduced  in  the  Senate.  Instead,  the
Senate  debate  centered  around  three proposals  for  regulatory  reform.  The  re-
sulting  debates  offered  complex  interactions  between  technocratic  forces  and
those  interested  in reducing  regulation whatever  its content.  The first bill,  Sen-
ate  Bill 291,  introduced  by Senator  Roth  on January  27,  1995,  called for  com-
paratively  modest  changes  in  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act.  It included
two  principal sets  of provisions. 139  The first would require  detailed  risk assess-
ment, in ways  comparable to House Bill  1022.  The second would require  agen-
cies  to  favor  flexible,  market-based  incentives  rather  than  rigid  commands  in
formulating  regulations.  The  bill  received  broad  bipartisan  support  and  was
unanimously  reported  out  of the  Governmental  Affairs  Committee  on  March
23,  1995.140

The  second  bill,  Senate  Bill  343,  championed  by  Senator  Dole, was  more
ambitious.  It received far more attention and became the focal point for legisla-
tive  debate.  The  Dole  bill--obviously  connected  with  issues  of presidential
politics-was  introduced  on  February  2,  1995.141  Unlike the  Roth  proposal,
this  bill  contained  no  specific  provision  requiring  agencies  to  use  economic
incentives.  It did,  however,  contain  several  controversial  provisions.  Three  in
particular  deserve  mention  here.  First, the  bill  would  have  banned  agencies
from  acting unless  a federal  statute explicitly  required  them  to  do  so.142  Sec-
ond, the bill included a complex supermandate  requiring agencies  to apply cost-
benefit  analysis  to  all  regulations  unless  "explicit textual  language"  of the au-
thorizing  statute  required  otherwise. 143

Finally,  the  Dole  bill  would  impose  several  layers  of procedural  scrutiny,
including  peer, congressional,  and judicial  review.  Echoing  House Bill  1022,
the  Dole bill's peer  review  provision  did not  disqualify  "peers"  with potential
financial  interests. 144  In addition,  the Dole bill allowed  any person  affected  by
a  regulation  to  petition  agencies  for  review  of existing  rules,  under  the  new
cost-benefit  criteria,  and seek judicial review  of the  denial of any such petition.
The  Dole  bill  also  called  for  judicial  review  of any  risk-assessment  or  cost-
benefit  analysis.  Finally,  the  bill  provided  for  congressional  review  of major

regulations  through a formal  submission process  that gave  Congress  an oppor-
tunity to  veto.  As  we have  seen,  this provision  was  enacted  separately  in Sen-
ate Bill  219.145

By  late June,  the  Dole  bill  had  undergone  four  major revisions.  The  first
was  the "Grassley"  substitute,  which eliminated  some of the most extreme  pro-
posals,  including  the  provision  saying  that  agencies  should not  act  unless  re-
quired  to  do  so  and  the judicial  review  provisions,  which  were  clarified  and
softened.  The  informally  named  Grassley  substitute-so-called  after  Senator
Grassley became  a co-sponsor  on March  22,  1995-responded  to many of the
sharpest  criticisms  of the  original  Dole  bill.

At this  stage  President  Clinton's  signals were  somewhat  mixed.  In an im-
portant  speech on April  7, the President  indicated that he would veto any  legis-
lation  that would  undermine  protection  of clean air  and clean water;  but he  did
not offer  details.  He  also  said that  he would  veto  any  generic  bill  that would
lead  to  litigation  preventing  regulators  from  doing  their  work.  But President
Clinton  did not specifically address  Senate  Bill 343,  nor did he  explain whether
he  believed  the  bill  had  these  adverse  effects.  It  was  not  clear  whether  the
President  would  veto  the  Dole  bill.14 6

On May 26, the  second  revision of the Dole bill  was introduced.  The revi-
sion  eliminated  interlocutory  judicial  review  of agency  determinations  that  a
regulation  was  major  and  therefore  subject  to  a risk  assessment.' 47  The  revi-
sion  also  added  a provision  that would preclude  agencies  from regulating  "in-
significant"  risks,  and  would  thereby  repeal  the  well-known  and  highly
controversial  Delaney  Clause,  which  forbids  the  use  of  carcinogens  in  food
additives. 148  Proponents  of this provision rejected the zero risk standard  estab-
lished  by  the Delaney  Clause  as  inflexible  and  outdated.

The third  revision to the Dole  bill sprang from  a joint effort between  Sena-
tors Dole and  Johnston.  The  "staff drafts"  that resulted  from their intense  dis-
cussions  continued  in  the  direction  set by  the  Grassley  substitute.  First, they
reduced judicial  control  by  limiting judicial  review  of agency  rulemaking.' 4 9
Second,  they broadened  the  definition  of benefits  to  include  environmental  as
well  as  social  and economic  effects. 150

Apparently  at the  behest  of lobbyists,  a new  provision  was  added  to  alter
the  requirements  for  the Toxic  Substances  Inventory under the  Superfund  stat-
ute.  Under  current  law,  all  toxic  chemical  releases  must be  disclosed  to  the
public.' 5 l  Under the  proposed provision,  disclosure  would  be required  only if

LEGISLATIVE  FOREWORD

EPA found  a reasonable  basis  to believe  that the toxic release  created a risk to
human  health. 15 2 This  provision  became  crucial  to  Senate  debates.

After  complex negotiations,  a fourth  version of Senate Bill  343,  now called
the  Dole-Johnston  bill,  emerged. 15 3  The  bill  appeared  to  eliminate  the  so-
called  supermandate  provision  of the  original  bill  since  it  did  not  expressly
amend  existing  statutes  to  mandate  cost-benefit  analysis.  Instead,  in  a  more
ambiguous  formulation,  the bill proposed  certain  decisional  criteria  that would
"supplement"  and not "supersede"  existing legislation.  These  criteria  included
requirements  that benefits justify costs and that agencies  choose  least-cost  alter-
natives.  The Dole-Johnston bill retained the original provisions requiring  agen-
cies  to review existing rules  and to test them for conformity  to the new criteria.
To  enforce  this  requirement,  it maintained  provisions  permitting  industries  to
petition  an  agency  for  review  of existing  rules  under  the new  criteria  and  in-
cluded provisions  for judicial  oversight  of an agency's  failure  to respond  to  or
to  grant a  petition  for review.15 4  In addition,  rules  that were  not promptly  re-
viewed  would  expire  automatically.1 55

The  Dole-Johnston  bill  also  maintained  the  basic requirements  of risk  as-
sessment and  the judicial  review  provisions.  Importantly,  the  bill restored  in-
terlocutory 
review  an  agency's
determination  that  a  rule  is  not  "major"  or  that  a  risk  assessment  is  not  re-
quired. 156  The  bill  also  restated  the  law  governing  review  of agency  action,
though  it probably  would  not change  the  law  in  any material  way.1 57

The debate  intensified  with Senator Glenn's introduction  of the Democratic
alternative,  Senate  Bill  1001,  on  June  29.158  President  Clinton  endorsed  the
Glenn  bill  in  mid-July.1 59  Senator  Glenn  self-consciously  built  on  Senator
Roth's  bill,  which had  received  enthusiastic bipartisan  support  in  the  Govern-
mental Affairs  Committee.160  In fact the  Glenn bill differed from the Roth  bill
in  only  a  few  particulars.  Like  Roth's  bill,  the  Glenn  bill  clearly  would  not
override  the substantive requirements  of existing laws.  Responding  to  some of
the sharpest criticisms of the Dole bill, the Glenn bill limited judicial review.  It
allowed  agencies  to  review  existing rules, but did  not call for  automatic  termi-
nation  of those  rules  that  were  not  reviewed;  and  it  eliminated  any  petition

process  for those  dissatisfied with  existing rules.  The Glenn  bill did not require
agencies  to  show  that  a  risk  is  "significant";  in  this  way  it  would  not  have
repealed  the  Delaney  Clause. 16 1

On  behalf of his  proposal,  Senator  Glenn  emphasized  five  central  points.
First, his proposal  contained  more  limited judicial  review  of cost-benefit  analy-
sis  and risk assessment  than the  Dole bill.  Second,  his proposal  would  be pro-
cedural  rather  than  substantive;  thus  it would not  affect the Delaney  Clause  or
the  Toxic  Release  Inventory.  Third,  it  would  not include  a  petition  process.
Fourth,  it  would  not  include  a  supermandate  and  hence  would  not  affect  ex-
isting statutory requirements.  Fifth, its "sunshine"  provision would  ensure pub-
lic  disclosure  of  communications  between  agencies  and  the  Office  of
Management  and Budget  and of information relating  to the status of regulatory
review.162

From  June  30  through  July  20,  the  Senate  vigorously  debated  the  Dole-
Johnston  and  Glenn  proposals.  The  debate  centered  on  several  issues, includ-
ing  the scope  of judicial  review,  the petition  process,  the  supermandate  issue,
amendments  to  the  Delaney  Clause, 163  and  the  Toxic  Release  Inventory. 164
Consider  the  following  much-disputed  language  from  a late  draft  of the  Dole
bill:

(a)  ...  The  requirements  of this  section  [624]  shall  supplement,  and  not

supersede,  any  other  decisional  criteria  otherwise  provided  by law.

(b)  ...  [N]o  final major rule...  shall  be  promulgated  unless  the agency

head publishes  in the  Federal  Register  a finding that-

(1) the  benefits  from  the rule justify  the  costs  of the  rule;
(2)  the  rule  employs  to  the  extent  practicable  flexible  reasonable  alterna-

tives  [that is,  economic  incentives]  ...  ; and

(3) (A)  the  rule  adopts  the  least  cost alternative...
(B) if  scientific,  technical,  or  economic  uncertainties  or  nonquantifiable
benefits  ...  make  a more  costly  alternative  ...  appropriate  and  in the public
interest  and  the  agency  head  provides  an explanation  of those  considerations,
the rule adopts the least cost alternative of the reasonable  alternatives necessary
to  take  into  account  such  uncertainties  or benefits;  and

(4)  if a risk  assessment  is required  ....
(A)  the  rule is  likely  to  significantly reduce  the  human  health,  safety,  and

environmental  risks to  be addressed;  or

The  debate  prompted  Senate  Republicans  to  make  a number  of significant
changes  to  the  Dole  bill.  On July  10,  the  Senate  passed  the Nunn-Coverdell
Amendment, which requires  agencies  to  conduct a  cost-benefit  analysis  of any
rules  having  a  significant  economic  effect  on small  business. 166  On  July  11,
the  Senate  adopted an amendment  by Senator  Dole, to  clarify that the bill con-
tained  no  supermandate.167  This  was  crucial  to  several  of the holdout voters,
though  some  apparently  thought  the  clarification  was  not  clear  enough.  The
Senate  also revised  the threshold definition  of a major rule from  $50  million to
$100  million.  On  July  13,  the  Senate  adopted,  by  voice  vote,  a Roth-Biden
Amendment  designed  to  ensure  better priority-setting  and  attention  to  market
incentives. 168  The  Senate  also  adopted  an amendment preventing  those with  a
conflict  of interest  from  participating  on peer  review  panels. 169  On  the  same
day, the Senate  tabled, by a vote  of 50 to  48,  an amendment  to strike  the provi-
sions  relating  to  the Toxic  Release  Inventory. 170

In this period,  issues  about food  safety became  central  to the  debate.  Sev-
eral  cases  of E. coli  poisoning-heavily  publicized  in the key  primary  state  of
New Hampshire-threatened  to  turn the issue of regulatory reform  into  an ob-
stacle to  Senator Dole's presidential  hopes.  Advertisements  in New Hampshire
included  accusations  by a  group  of parents  of children  sickened  or killed  by
contaminated meat that Dole  was  "trying to  please his  big contributors  instead
of protecting  kids."'1 7 1  Nonetheless,  Senate Republicans,  supported by medical
experts,  refused to  amend  the Dole bill's  repeal  of the  Delaney  Clause. 172

On July 18,  the Senate narrowly rejected the Glenn bill by a margin of 52 to
48.173  The same  day,  the  Senate rejected  cloture  on the Dole  bill by  a vote  of
53  to 47.174  And two  days later, the Dole-Johnston  forces  again failed to close
further  debate,  this  time  by only  two votes. 175  This  last vote effectively  killed

the bill, and the prospects  for  regulatory reform  dimmed-despite  the fact that
a strong  majority  of the  members  favored  the  idea.

There were a few dying  embers.  Senate Democrats,  led by Senators  Conrad
and Robb,  attempted  to  assemble  a coalition to  enact  some combination  of the
Glenn  and  Dole  bills.  Although  it  looked  at first  as  if compromise  might  be
possible,  Senate  Republicans  rejected  the compromise  proposal. 17 6  The  major
sticking  points  were  the  amendment  of the  Delaney  Clause,  changes  in  the
Toxic  Release  Inventory, and the review  of existing regulations. 177  The  Demo-
crats  attempted  to  eliminate  these  provisions.  Dole  and  his  allies,  backed  by
public  statements  from business  groups, 178 firmly  rejected the  attempt  at com-
promise.  At this point, efforts at generic  reform  failed.  Oddly, the failure  was
a  result of an alliance  among status  quo  defenders-attacking the quite sensible
repeal  of the  Delaney  Clause-and  technocratic  forces  objecting to  the  Dole
bill's  excessive  procedural  provisions.

5.  Statute-by-statute reform and appropriations.

In  addition  to  the  generic  reform  proposals,  Congress  discussed  at  least
twenty-five statute-specific  proposals in an effort to produce  substantive regula-
tory reform. 179  I  cannot discuss them  in detail here.  But it is worth noting that
among the most prominent  of these were  dramatic proposals  to  reform the En-
dangered  Species  Act and the Clean Water Act.  Although  the Clean Water Act
amendments  passed  in  the  House  by  a  vote  of 240  to  185  on  May  16,180  the
prospects  for  substantial  change  were  essentially  eliminated  when  President
Clinton  announced  that he  would  veto the  bill.181

Of particular  importance  was  an appropriations  bill  containing  provisions
designed  to  limit  the  power  of the  EPA.18 2  The  bill  proposed,  among  other

from having to report uses of chemicals;  restrict EPA from setting standards  for
pesticides in food;  and ban the addition of new species to the list of endangered
species  under the  Endangered  Species  Act.18 3

The  prospects  for  these  provisions  were  dim in  the  Senate.  Moreover,  it
was  clear  that President  Clinton would  veto  the appropriations  bill  whether  or
not it included  these provisions. 184  The proposed  appropriations  cuts  were  no-
table (and  disturbing) insofar as  they suggested  a desire both to reduce environ-
mental regulation  through  a  relatively  less  visible  mechanism  and  to  prevent
agencies  from  developing  the  analytical  capacity  that  would  enable  them  to
engage  in  good policy  analysis.

The  House  was  also  able  to  inaugurate  a  new  tradition:  Speaker  Newt
Gingrich  proposed  a bill creating  "Corrections  Day" to  be  held  on the  second
and  fourth Tuesday  of each  month,  on which  the House  would  debate  bills  to
repeal  or modify  agency  regulations  or  statutes  enacted  by  Congress. 185  The
House adopted the rules for Corrections Day on June 20, 1995,  by a vote  of 271
to  146.186  A three-fifths  majority  would  be  required  for  a "correction."

Of course  appropriations issues in  general became,  in  October  1995,  a cen-
tral  feature  of the  attempted  revision  of American  government.  I  cannot  dis-
cuss the resulting debate  in  detail here.  But it is important to  identify the most
striking  fact  of the  debate:  Many  diverse  substantive  issues-involving  wel-
fare reform, Medicaid,  environmental  issues,  and much more-were  dealt  with
all  at  once  under  the  single heading  of appropriations.

This  development  made  crystal  clear  and  highly  visible  a  growing  fact  of
American  government,  namely that  substantive policy  is made,  not simply by
deciding on funding levels, but also through conditions  and limitations attached
to  funds.  These  conditions  and limitations  can move  government  in  very new
directions.  Thus the principal  debates  between President Clinton  and the  104th
Congress  often  took the form  of debates  over  appropriations  bills. 187  And the

[Vol.  48:247

substantive  changes  proposed  in  the  October  1995  bills  were  much more  far-
reaching  than  the  substantive  changes  proposed  in  (for  example)  the  generic
regulatory  reform  legislation.  Indeed,  the  appropriations  bills  would  have  a
wide range  of effects  on regulation  itself, not excluding the  environmental area,
where  restrictions  would  sharply  reduce EPA  authority.' 88

6.  A  note  on  the politics of regulatory reform.

In the  end regulatory  reform  failed  because  the  public  was  not unambigu-
ously committed  to  it.  But many political  factors  shaped  Congress'  efforts  as
well.  Industry pressure,  public  sentiment, presidential  veto  threats,  and institu-
tional  realities  all  steered  reform  efforts.  I  offer  some brief notes  here.

Interest  groups  played a significant role  with respect  to the  generic  statutes.
For  example,  the  Grocery  Manufacturers  Association  helped  write  the  Dole
bill's provision that would  have repealed  the Delaney Clause.18 9  Industry  rep-
resentatives  also  contributed  substantially  to  specific  statutes.  For  example,
corporate  lobbyists  drafted proposed revisions  to  the Clean  Water Act  and  the
Endangered  Species  Act. 19 0

More  generally,  the  Senate  acted-as  it historically has-as  a "cooler"  for
House bills,  operating in a slower and more  deliberative  manner. 19'  Recall that
the  House  passed  its  generic  reform  bill  just  five  days  after  it  was  intro-
duced. 192  This  pattern  was  widely noticed in  the  104th  Congress.  The House
acted  rapidly  and  sloppily;  the  Senate  held  hearings  and took  its time.

7.  An  evaluation: contract without (enough) deliberation.

What  are  we  to  make  of this  complex  set  of events?  The  performance  of
the  House  of Representatives  deserves  much  criticism  and  little  praise.  The
House  generic  reform  initiative,  House  Bill  1022,  was not a good  bill.  It con-
tained a number  of promising  ideas, and  in some  ways  it might well  have  im-
proved current  regulatory practices.  But it was also very much a mess:  sloppy,
confusing, and filled with provisions  that had not been thought through.  It was
far too  rushed  and  ill-considered.  It was  a parody  of deliberative  democracy.
The best that might be  said for  the House's  actions  is that prompt passage
of House  Bill  1022  spurred  a  debate  in  the  Senate  and  indeed the  nation  that
was  certainly  overdue  and might  not have  otherwise  occurred.  From this  per-
spective,  House  Bill  1022  served  less  as  a  proposed  law  than  as  an  action-

LEGISL4TIVE  FOREWORD

Much proposed  legislation  in the  104th  Congress  had  a similar  effect.  It justi-
fies  George  Washington's  supposed observations  about bicameralism.  Thomas
Jefferson  is  said  to have  asked  Washington,  over  breakfast,  why  the Constitu-
tion  provides  for  the  Senate  as  well  as  the  House.  Washington  responded:
"Why  did  you pour  that  coffee  into  your  saucer?"  Jefferson  responded:  "To
cool  it."  Washington's  rejoinder  was:  "Even  so,  we  pour legislation  into  the
senatorial  saucer  to  cool  it.' 19 3  Perhaps  the goal  of the House  was  to set pro-
posals  before  the  Senate  in the hope  that seeing  the  general  direction  in which
the  nation  should move,  the  Senate  would  enact more  responsible  and  careful
proposals.

What  about  the  Senate?  A  charitable  observer  can  find  much  ground  for
enthusiasm.  All  of the  relevant  proposals  incorporated  an understanding  that
balancing  is  better  than  absolutism.  Despite  its  symbolic  value,  the  Delaney
Clause  is  hard  to  defend;  indeed,  it is  far from clear  that the  Clause  promotes
human health. 194  An exemption  of de minimis risks would  advance the process
of good  priority-setting.  Here  technocratic  learning  should  have  produced  a
bipartisan  consensus.  Also  promising  was  the  Senate's enthusiasm  for  market
incentives  and  for  least-cost  solutions.  Moreover,  the  Senate  proceeded  in  a
more  or less  deliberative  manner.  Unlike the House, it held  extensive hearings
and  its members  engaged  in  lengthy  and  sometimes  productive  debates.  The
Roth-Biden  Amendment,  an effort to promote better priority-setting,  showed an
admirable  understanding of qualitative  differences  among diverse risks. 195  Per-
haps  the  104th  Congress  served  as  a  transitional  one  in  which  a great  deal  of
learning  occurred.

But an account of this sort  would probably be too enthusiastic.  Much of the
debate  dwelled  on  unhelpful  dichotomies:  whether  we  should  have  "more"
rather  than  "less"  regulation  and  whether  the  Dole  bill  "went too  far"  or  the
Glenn bill "did  too little."' 9 6  Too often Congress  avoided substantive issues by
focusing  on  procedure;  too  often  Senators  proposed  procedural  solutions  in-
stead of making  hard choices.  Many initiatives  attempted  to derail  the adminis-
trative  state  through paperwork  requirements.

In the  next  section,  I  spell  out  these  criticisms  and  suggest  some  possible
improvements.  But  for the moment  a more general  conclusion  is  appropriate.
The  task  of fundamentally  reforming  the modem  regulatory  state  is  complex
and  unwieldy;  the  104th  Congress  faced  (and  the  105th  and  106th  Congresses
will  face)  a job  far  more  complex  than  anything  faced  by  New  Deal  Con-
gresses-and  this notwithstanding  the fact that the nation  is in  far better  shape

than it was  during the Depression.  We might even conclude, at least  provision-
ally,  that  Congress  is  institutionally  ill-equipped  to  attempt  major  reform,  at
least  if it  does  a  great  deal  at the micro  level.  Legislators  are  generalists,  not
specialists,  and  they have  many issues to  address.  They  lack expertise  in  par-
ticular  areas.  They are  also subject to  intense political pressures  that can  favor
"lowest  common denominator"  solutions.  Disagreements  within the House and
Senate  can  lead  in  similar  directions.

In  the  104th  Congress,  the  House  was  able  to  act  quickly,  driven  by  the
discipline  demanded  by the  Contract with America and  Speaker  of the  House
Newt  Gingrich;  yet  the  results  are  nothing  to  celebrate.  The  Senate  was  not
similarly  unified, and hence the process  of deliberation  produced  nothing at all.
The  executive  branch  has  major advantages  on this  count.  It  can  more easily
use specialized  experience.1 97  I will return to these  issues below;1 98 but for the
moment let  us  consider  how  Congress  might have  done  better.

IV.  ToWARD NEw  INiTATIVES

A.  Procedure and Paperwork: Less Is More

Part of the  104th Congress'  attempt  at regulatory reform  involved not  sub-
stantive  criteria  but paperwork  requirements  designed  to  delay  and  thwart  the
issuance  of regulations.1 99  This  strategy  resembles  the  "moratorium"  idea-
not an effort to  design good regulations  and to prevent bad  ones, but instead an
indiscriminate  strategy to  stultify  agencies,  even though  agencies might be try-
ing  to  reduce  regulatory  burdens.

A  particular  problem  in  the relevant  bills  is  the  addition  of multiple  new
layers  of review-by  courts,  peers,  and  Congress  itself.  In this  context,  Con-
gress  should have  followed  a strategy  of addition by  subtraction.  Future Con-
gresses might  build on the current  proposals by making  them  leaner-more  in
the way  of substance,  less  in  the  way of paperwork.

1.  Existing rules and judicial review.

Much  of the  debate  in  the  Senate  stemmed  from  the Dole  bill's  complex
provisions  compelling  agencies  to  undertake  reviews  of existing  rules.  These
provisions  are  an understandable  effort  to ensure  that agencies  do  not maintain
rules  that cost much and accomplish  little or no good. 20 0  Moreover, regulations
can  become  obsolete,  and  a mechanism  for  ensuring  periodic  review  makes  a
good  deal  of sense.

On balance,  however, the  proposed  petition  process  is  not  easy to  defend.
Such a process  could increase  interest-group  power, prevent agencies  from de-
voting  their  limited  resources  to  the  most  important  matters,  increase  uncer-

199.  These efforts  would thus  aggravate  the problem of "ossification"  of rulemaking.  See gener-
ally Thomas  0.  MeGarity,  Some  Thoughts on  "Deossifying" the  Rulemaking Process, 41  DKnE  LJ.

LEGISLATIVE  FOREWORD

tainty  about existing rules, produce  random agenda  selection,  and  allow people
in the private  sector to  divert taxpayer  resources  for what may well be  insuffi-
cient gain.  Review of existing rules requires  substantial  resources, and if agen-
cies  are  required  to  revisit  current  rules  each  time  an  affected  party  raises  a
question,  the petition  process  could  create  the very  kind  of rigidity  that  good
regulatory  reform  strives to  prevent.

In some  areas,  the petition  process  is quite  unnecessary.  Under  Presidents
Reagan,  Bush,  and  Clinton,  many  agencies  have  already  done  some  kind  of
cost-benefit  analysis.20 1  For this  reason,  it is  unclear that  the petition  process
would  do  much  good.  To  be sure,  past  cost-benefit  analyses  were  done  under
somewhat  different  standards  from those  that would have been created  by Sen-
ate Bill 343;  and independent agencies  were  exempted  from previous presiden-
tial requirements  (a gap filled by Senate Bill 343).  In this way,  Senate Bill 343
would  not  be  entirely  unnecessary.  The  process  could,  however,  cause  real
harm by making  the status  of existing  rules unclear  and by drowning  agencies
in paperwork.  Critically, any right to petition would allow private parties  to set
the public  agenda  and  to coopt  public  resources  for the  sake  of undertaking  a
costly, complex,  and possibly redundant  analysis of existing rules.  If people in
the  private  sector  could  ask  all  agencies  to  undertake  cost-benefit  analyses
under the new standards  of Senate  Bill 343,  they would be able  to use taxpayer
resources  for  analyses  that simply  produce  waste  and delay.2 0 2  In light  of the
fact that Senate Bill 343  would apply to many hundreds  and perhaps  thousands
of rules,  the paperwork  burden  could be  enormous.

The  prospect  of judicial  review raises  further  difficulties.  If courts  can re-
view  denial  of petitions  to  review  existing rules,  there  will  be  high  litigation
costs.  This is especially true since the petition process  would require  an agency
to  decide  whether  "reasonable  questions  exist '2 0 3  about  the  cost-benefit  judg-
ment  and  would  allow judicial  review  of agency  decisions  on  this  point.  In
many cases,  "reasonable  questions"  do  "exist,"  and hence judicial  involvement
and  management  might  well be  common.

Notably,  Presidents Reagan,  Bush, and  Clinton all  decided  to insulate cost-
benefit  analyses  from  the judiciary---on  the theory  that judicial  review  would
produce  delay,  confusion,  and  error,  especially  in  light  of the judges'  lack  of
democratic  accountability  or  factfinding  competence.  The  executive  branch
and Congress both seem better equipped to use  cost-benefit  analysis to evaluate
and correct most regulations.  It probably does make sense to subject cost-bene-
fit analysis  to judicial  review  when the agency's  decision does,  under  the rele-
vant  statute,  depend  on  that analysis.  It may  also  make  sense  to  include  any
cost-benefit  or  risk  assessment  in  the  whole  record  for  review  of rules.  But
beyond this,  judicial  review  should  not take  place.

201.  See  Exec. Order  No.  12,866,  supra note  2;  Exec.  Order  No.  12,291,  supra note  2.
202.  To  be  sure,  many  agencies  might  respond  to  petitions  simply  by  repeating  a  cost-benefit
analysis  calculated  pursuant  to  executive  orders.  But  the  different  standards  of Senate  Bill  343  will
require  agencies  to  recalculate  some  cost-benefit  analyses,  and  new  data will  require  the updating  of
others.

[Vol.  48:247

2.  "Peer review."

Both House  Bill  1022  and  Senate  Bill  343  show  enthusiasm  for "peer  re-
view."  In  particular,  section  640  of Senate  Bill  343  would  require  the  execu-
tive  branch  to  develop  a  "systematic  program  for  the  peer  review"  of  risk
assessments.  This  provision  moves  in  a sensible  direction-toward  a greater
role  for the executive  branch  in  generating uniform risk  assessment  guidelines
and  in ranking  risks and  establishing  priorities  for  Congress,  agencies,  and  the
public.2ยฐ 4  No  institution  in  government  is  currently  charged  with this  impor-
tant  task.  Peer review  might  well play  a role  in this  process.

In its  current  form,  however, a  requirement  of peer review  for risk assess-
ment  is  premature.  Any  "systematic  program  for  peer  review"  could  prove
enormously  expensive  and produce  unnecessary  delay.  Of course,  no  "peers"
are  entirely objective; judgments  about risk necessarily  depend on assumptions,
and those  assumptions  will  likely be  founded  on judgments  of value. 205  Since
"peers"  may  well  have  their  own  agendas,  the  process  of peer review  could
aggravate  the problems  raised  by interest-group  power  over  regulation.

It  is  also  unclear  whether,  in  light  of the rest  of Senate  Bill  343,  the  peer
review  process is at all necessary, or whether its goals could not be promoted  in
other ways.  Agencies now  experiment with peer review when it seems to make
sense,  and  the conventional  process  of notice  and  comment allows  a high  de-
gree  of peer  "review"  of agency  proposals.  In  any  case,  both  the  House  and
Senate  bills  create  at least  the appearance  of impropriety  insofar  as  they allow
participation  by  peer  reviewers  with  a potential  conflict  of interest.20 6

Section 640  of Senate Bill 343  should be eliminated.  Certainly people with
a potential financial  interest should not be allowed  to participate  on peer review
panels.  Agencies  should  be  encouraged  to  experiment  with  such  panels,  but
any  generic  requirement  should  await  the  outcomes  of these  experiments.

3.  Joint resolution of disapproval.

Both Houses  of Congress  passed legislation  requiring  certain regulations  to
be  submitted to  Congress  for potential  veto.  Thus under section  801  of Senate
Bill  343,  major  regulations  would  be  submitted  to  Congress  before  taking  ef-
fect,  and  Congress  could  enact  a "joint resolution of disapproval"  to  stop  such
regulations  from  becoming  law.  Since  these  joint  resolutions  result  from bi-
cameral  action and  are  submitted  to the President  for his  signature,  there is  no
constitutional  problem  with  this provision.

The  provision  for congressional  review  has  obvious virtues.  It  appears  to
enhance  political  accountability  by  providing  a formal  mechanism  by  which
elected  representatives  may  oversee,  and eliminate,  proposed  regulations.  The

LEGISLATIVE  FOREWORD

process  of congressional  review might  also  deter agencies  from submitting ill-
considered  or  faction-driven  regulations  to  Congress.  Moreover,  agencies
might  more frequently signal to  Congress  that some statutorily  mandated regu-
lations  make  little  sense,  and  the  process  of review  might  lead  Congress  to
change the relevant statute.20 7  It is in part for these reasons  that President  Clin-
ton  expressed  enthusiasm  for  congressional  review. 20 8

It is unclear, however,  how much  this provision  would add,  since  Congress
can  already  enact legislation  to prevent  any and  all regulations  from becoming
law.  There  are  risks  as  well.  A serious  problem  with congressional  review  is
that it might,  in practice,  give well-organized  interest  groups  a chance  to bring
pressure  to bear  on hundreds  or even  thousands  of regulations.  In  this way  it
might increase rather  than decrease  the problem of factional  influence. 20 9  Sec-
tion 801  would  also  require  Congress  to  expend  limited  resources  reviewing  a
wide  range  of agency  rules, many  of which should  be uncontroversial.

The  competing considerations  do not lead to any obvious conclusion.  But a
new  statutory  provision  for  congressional  review  adds  nothing  to  Congress'
existing  authority.  Setting  up a formal  mechanism  for review  of regulations  is
probably  too  costly  and  time-consuming  to  be  worthwhile;  narrower  "report-
ing" strategies  could accomplish  the same  goals.  Hence  section 801  might well
impose  costs  that  are  not justified  by benefits.

B.  Modest Changes2 10

How  might  Congress  improve  the  proposals  mentioned  above?  I  begin
with some modest changes  designed  to accomplish  Congress'  apparent goals  in
a more  effective  manner.

1.  Valuation of benefits.

Some  theoretical issues.  If a  substantive  supermandate  is  to  operate  as  a
kind  of constitutional  amendment  to  the  regulatory  state,  it  seems  crucial  to
understand  what cost-benefit  balancing  actually  entails.  Much  of the  national
debate  in the  last year  involved  the value of cost-benefit  analysis.  Proponents
characterized  cost-benefit  analysis  as  a  method  of disciplining  administrative
power  through  salutary  balancing;  opponents  feared  that  cost-benefit  analysis
cold-heartedly  sacrifices  human  health  and  life  for  the  sake  of mere  dollars.

207.  The  EPA  has on  several  occasions  signalled that  it would  prefer not to  issue  statutorily  re-
quired  regulation  because  the  costs are  high  and the benefits  low.  See, e.g.,  Impact of Regulatory Re-
form Proposals on EPA: Hearings Before the Senate Comm.  on Environment and Public Works,  104th
Cong.,  1st Sess.  (1995)  (statement  of Carol  Browner,  Administrator, EPA).

STANFORD  LAW  REVIEW

[Vol. 48:247

But this  is  at  best  a  caricature.  By  itself, the  notion  of cost-benefit  analysis
appears very close  to empty;  everything  depends on how  costs and benefits  are
characterized  and  on how underlying  issues  of valuation  are  resolved. 2 11

Two  criticisms  can  be  made  of a proposed  framework  (or  supermandate)
for  evaluating  governmental  performance.  The  first  is  that  the  framework  is
wrong  because  it  ignores  certain  important  variables,  or  is  founded  on an  in-
defensible  theory  of value.  The  second  criticism is  that  the  framework  is  in-
completely  specified,  in  the  sense  that  its  meaning  depends  on  further
subsidiary judgments  that have yet to be  offered.  Cost-benefit  analysis  is prop-
erly  subject  to  the first  kind  of criticism  to  the  extent that  it purports  to  align
values  along the  single  metric  of aggregated  private  willingness  to  pay-and
evaluates  regulation  by  reference  to  that  criterion  alone.  Indeed,  regulation
might be founded  on citizen judgments that have no clear parallel in aggregated
willingness to pay.2 12  Or it may be rooted in distributive rather than allocative
goals; consider  the antidiscrimination  laws as possible  examples.  To the extent
that cost-benefit  analysis  is rooted  in the  technical  economists'  understanding,
it  has  a  great  deal  to  offer,  but  it  cannot  capture  many  appropriate  goals  of
regulation.

As  a political  creed, however, the principal  problem with  cost-benefit  anal-
ysis is that  it is incompletely specified.  Its meaning  depends  on how costs and
benefits  are  characterized  and  on  how  issues  of valuation  are  resolved.  Do
equitable  concerns  enter the  cost-benefit  calculus?  Suppose,  for example,  that
a certain environmental  risk is concentrated  among African-Americans. 21 3  Can
a  good  cost-benefit  analysis  take  this  into  account?  Or  suppose  that  some  of
the benefits  of regulation  are  aesthetic.  How  will these benefits  be valued?  An
extensive  literature  explores  the valuation  of human  life.2 14  Though,  by itself,
cost-benefit  analysis  takes  no position  on the associated  controversies,  regula-
tors asked to  operate  under cost-benefit  analysis  must take some such  position.

2.  Cost-benefit analysis as a quasi-constitutional amendment.

With  these points  in mind we  can ask  the general  question:  Would  a gen-
eral  requirement  of  cost-benefit  analysis  be  a  sensible  supermandate  for  the

211.  The  use  of a  single  metric  does,  however,  raise  some  difficulties.  See  Pildes  &  Sunstein,

regulatory  state?  Would  such  a  requirement  be  like  a  constitutional  amend-
ment,  or would  it be  a modest  way  of disciplining  agency  discretion?

The most basic  point here  is that  the modem  state  includes  a diverse  array
of regulatory  statutes, with  diverse legitimate  purposes, including  but not at all
limited  to  economic  efficiency.  Consider  the  following:
" Many  important  regulatory  states  are  plausibly understood  in  terms  of eco-
nomic  efficiency; 2 15  they can be seen as  efforts to counteract  market failures.
The  Federal  Insecticide,  Fungicide,  and  Rodenticide  Act 2 16  and  the  Toxic
Substances  Control  Act2 17  are  examples.  Such  statutes  may be  designed  to
overcome an absence  of sufficient  information;  harms to third parties;  or col-
lective  action  problems  of various  sorts.218

" Some  statutes  are  designed  to  eliminate  illegitimate  discrimination  or  what
might  be  understood  as  caste-like  features  in  modem  society.2 19  Though
some  people  think  that  such  statutes  can  be  defended  on  efficiency
grounds, 22 0 their  animating  impulse has little to  do with economic  efficiency.
"  Some  statutes  are  designed  to  protect  cultural  aspirations. 2 21  Examples  in-
clude  measures  safeguarding  the  national  parks,  encouraging  high-quality
programming,  and protecting  endangered  species.

" Some  statutes  are designed  to  redistribute to the poor or to  others understood
as having a good claim to public help.  This is  so even though  regulation  is a
poor  tool  for  this  purpose,22-  and  though  redistribution  may  really  benefit
well-organized  interest  groups with little  claim to  public  assistance.  The  So-
cial Security Act is an obvious example of redistributive  law;  the Agricultural
Adjustment Act  can  also be understood  in  this way, with appropriate  qualifi-

Doubtless  other possibilities  could  be  mentioned. 223  The  point  is that  the
highly  diverse  grounds  for federal  regulation  raise many questions  about  cost-
benefit analysis  as  the only  ground  for  regulation.

[Vol.  48:247

If it is intended  as a quasi-constitutional  amendment  to the regulatory  state,
a  cost-benefit  supermandate  could  be  understood  in  at  least  three  different
ways.  In  its most  ambitious  form,  the mandate  would  amount  to  an  endorse-
ment of the principle  of economic efficiency  as the exclusive  basis-the "deci-
sion  criterion"--for  interpretation  and  application  of  all  statutes.2 2 4  This
would  be  a  fundamental  change  both  because  it would understand  cost-benefit
analysis  in  a  particular  way-as  a  term  for  the  criterion  of  economic  effi-
ciency-and because  it would amend  statutes  that, when  enacted, seemed moti-
vated  by something  other than  the  efficiency  criterion.

If this  were  the  understanding  of the  supermandate,  all  of the  statutes  to
which the  supermandate  applies  would  henceforth  be understood  in  efficiency
terms.  To say  the least, this  would be  a dramatic  shift in  national understand-
ings.  It would  indeed represent  a kind  of constitutional  amendment of the  ad-
ministrative  state,  rebuilding regulatory efforts  on a new foundation.  While the
most ambitious  reformers  in the  Senate and the House  came  close to  this view,
none  endorsed  it explicitly.

Another,  less  ambitious  possibility is to  understand the  cost-benefit  criteria
in  efficiency  terms,  but  only  for  those  statutes  that  were  designed  to  promote
economic  efficiency.  Under  this  approach,  the  supermandate  would  not  alter
the  basic  understandings  of existing  statutes.  It would  instead  have  a  more
modest but nonetheless  important goal:  imposing  a particular  understanding of
technocratic  rationality  on  statutes  formerly  understood  and implemented  in  a
less  precise,  more  ad  hoc,  and  more  intuitive  way.  As  we  will  see,  there  is
much to  be  said  in  favor  of this  basic approach.

A third  and least  ambitious  possibility  is to understand  cost-benefit  criteria
in a less technical  and more common-sensical  way, as an invitation to balance a
range  of variables  under statutes that had formerly been thought to be absolutist
and hence  to  forbid  balancing.  On this  view, a supermandate  would  not be  so
ambitious  as  to  call  for  the  use  of purely  economic  criteria.  It  would  more
modestly  ask  administrators  to  look  at  costs,  or  adverse  effects,  as  well  as  at
benefits.  This  was probably the goal of the majority  of those members  of Con-
gress  who  were  in  favor  of  a  substantive  supermandate.  And  if the  super-
mandate  is  understood  in  these  terms,  it  makes  a  great  deal  of sense.  As  we
will see,  the principal  objection  to  such a  supermandate  is  that it  is too  open-
ended.  Congress  can  and  should  take  steps  to  clarify  it,  though-I  empha-
size-without  mandating  the  efficiency  criterion  outside  of  the  context  of
"market  failure"  statutes.225

3.  Theory and practice.
The  House  and  Senate  bills  offered  almost no  guidance  for  characterizing
costs  and benefits,  and no guidance  at all  on the crucial  issue  of how to value

224.  EPsTrEN, supra note  31,  at  30  (asserting that  the  efficiency  approach  to justice  "offer[s]  the
best  justificatory  apparatus  for  demarcating  the  scope  of  state  power  from  the  area  of  individual
choice").  Even  when  economic  efficiency  is  not the  basis  for  the statute,  or  when  benefits  cannot  be
quantified,  it makes  sense  to  require  agencies  to  quantify costs  to  the  extent that  this  is  possible.

LEGISLATIVE  FOREWORD

costs  and  benefits.  For this  reason,  the  provisions  look highly  substantive  but
are  in  fact  largely  procedural.  Without  guidance  to  constrain  valuation,  a  re-
quirement  of  cost-benefit  analysis  is  quite  open-ended,  though  certainly  not
meaningless.  It alerts  agencies  to the need to balance  a range  of considerations
and as a procedural  requirement, it will  affect outcomes.  Moreover,  courts may
invalidate  outcomes  that,  by  general  understandings,  seem  either  out  of  line
with  existing  practice  or  too  absolutist. 226  Certainly there  is  a  difference  be-
tween  agency  behavior  under  balancing  statutes  and  agency  behavior  under
statutes  that forbid  balancing. 227

It  is  possible  to  conclude  that  Congress  should  restrict  itself to  a  call  for
cost-benefit  analysis  and  leave  the  details  to  agencies.228  Perhaps  Congress
lacks  the  detailed  understanding  that would  enable  it  to  answer  the  more spe-
cific  questions.  But if we  are  at all  concemed  about  administrative  discretion,
we  should  urge  greater  guidance  from  the  national  legislature.2 29  In any  case
the generic  bills  introduced  in the House  and  Senate would  be much improved
if they  offered  more  direction  to  agencies.  I  offer  two suggestions  here.

Qualitative factors.  As  I  noted in  Part I,  people care  not simply  about the
aggregate  amount of lives saved,  but also  about a range of factors involving  the
nature  of the particular  risk.  For most people,  the most salient  contextual  fea-
tures  are:  (1) whether the risk is catastrophic  in nature;  (2) whether  the risk is
uncontrollable;  (3) whether  the  risk involves  irretrievable  or permanent  losses;
(4)  whether  the  risk  is  voluntarily  incurred;  (5) whether  the  risk  is  equitably
distributed  or  concentrated  on  identifiable,  innocent,  or traditionally  disadvan-
taged  victims;  (6)  whether  the  risk  is  well  understood;  (7)  whether  the  risk
would  be  faced  by future generations;  and  (8) whether the  risk  is familiar.2 30
Any cost-benefit  analysis  that Congress requires  regulatory  agencies  to per-
form  should  reflect  these  factors.  In  developing  a  cost-benefit  formula,  Con-
gress  should recognize  that a purely quantitative  or monetary understanding  of
costs  and benefits  is  inadequate.  The various  consequences  of regulation  ought
not  to  be  thought  commensurable  along  a single  metric. 23 1  Any  cost-benefit
analysis  should be  accompanied  by a  disaggregated,  qualitative  description  of
the  consequences  of government  action,  so  that  Congress  and  the  public  can

obtain a fuller picture than  the crude and misleadingly precise  "bottom line"  of
the cost-benefit  analysis. 232  This  is not at all to  deny that it is important  to  be
precise  and quantitative  when possible.  It is only to  say that any "bottom line"
characterization  and  assessment  of costs  and  benefits  will  involve  judgments
about values, not about  science; Congress  and the public  should see what those
judgments  are. 233

I have  suggested  that regulatory  statutes  have  legitimate  and diverse  func-
tions  and that some of those functions do not involve economic  efficiency.  For
this  reason,  the  efficiency  criterion  is  inadequate  as  a  complete  guide  to  the
regulatory  state.  It is therefore  best for  Congress to understand  costs  and bene-
fits  in  the  economic  fashion  only  for  statutes  that  are  designed  to  overcome
market  failures.  And  even  here,  there  is  room  for  qualifying  the  economic
analysis-when,  for  example,  the  risk  at issue  is  inequitably  distributed,  and
when political actors believe  that it deserves  special  attention for that reason.2 4
When  the  statute  does not involve  market failure,  Congress would  still require
cost-benefit  balancing  as  the general  background  rule; but it should understand
the  definition of costs  and benefits  to be sufficiently broad as  to  allow adminis-
trators  to  depart  from  purely  economic  criteria.  Judicial  review  should  be
available  to  police  administrative  decisions  for  reasonableness  and  consis-
tency.2 35  In the long run, it might be hoped, a common law of regulatory  prac-
tice might emerge  to create  rationality and reasonableness  where  there is now a
high  degree of arbitrariness.

The  issues  I  have  discussed-the  diverse  grounds  for regulatory  statutes,
problems  of  incommensurability,  qualitative  distinctions-are  probably  too
subtle  and  complex  to  justify  anything  like  legislative  codification.  Instead
they suggest that Congress should:  (1) enact a general background  requirement

232.  See ANDERSON,  supra note 222,  at  191-216  (arguing that  consequentialist  cost-benefit  analy-

sis  fails to  account  for  "the  diversity  of people's  values").

233.  To  account  for citizens'  value  judgments,  Senate  Bill  343  should be amended  as follows:
1.  Definition of "benefit."  Change section  621(5) to  read "the term 'benefit'  means  the reasonably
identifiable  significant  benefits,  including  social,  economic,  ecological, distributional, and aesthetic
benefits,  that are reasonably expected  to result directly  or indirectly  from implementation  of a rule or an
alternative  to  a rule."  My  italicized  additions  allow  agencies  to define  "benefit"  to account  for citizen
judgments.

2.  Description of benefits and costs.  Add  the  following  sentence  to  section  622(e)(1)(A):  "An
agency shall  offer a  disaggregated  description  of the relevant  costs  and benefits,  containing an account
of the  qualitative  differences,  if  any, among  the costs  and benefits  at  stake."  This provision  permits  a
more comprehensive  examination  of the  full  cost-benefit  landscape.

3.  Diverse cost and benefit factors. Add the  following section,  622(e)(1)(C):  "Where  practicable,
the agency shall,  in  evaluating  and comparing  costs and benefits,  consider public judgments  about how
best to  assess  relevant risks,  including  whether the  risks under  consideration  are involuntarily  incurred,
likely to affect  future  generations,  potentially  catastrophic,  especially  dreaded,  irreversible,  or  inequita-
bly  distributed."  The  list  is  not  exhaustive,  but  does  provide  agencies  an  opportunity  to  account  for
diverse  public  judgments.

234.  This qualification  should  not be  used to allow private  groups  to skew  economic  analyses  in
their preferred  directions.  It should  instead provide  room  for a formal  channel to  qualify the  economic
analysis  when,  for example,  poor  people  are  peculiarly  at risk.

235.  See, e.g.,  Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA,  947 F.2d  1201,  1220-22  (5th Cir.  1991)  (discuss-

ing whether  the  EPA  regulatory  decision  had a  "reasonable  basis").

LEGISLATIVE  FOREWORD

of  cost-benefit  balancing, 236  with  a  relatively  open-ended  understanding  of
both costs  and  benefits;  (2) permit agencies  to understand  cost-benefit  analysis
in  a way that best  fits with  the particular  statutory  scheme;  (3) impose  a  cost-
effectiveness  or "least  cost"  requirement  as  part of the supermandate;  and  (4)
require  more  technical  cost-benefit  balancing  on  a  statute-by-statute  basis,
when there is a considered legislative judgment that the statute  is a response to
a market  failure,  economically  defined.  Congress  should,  however,  attempt  to
impose some  constraints  on agency valuations  and tools, as I will now discuss.
Floors and ceilings.  It is  of course  troublesome  to  assign  dollar  values to
life,  partly  for  the  reasons  I  have  sketched.  But  since  tradeoffs  of multiple
kinds  are  inevitable,  it may  be  best  for  Congress  to  set out  some  guidelines,
including floors  and ceilings governing  expenditures,  without pretending to say
how  much a life  is "really  worth."  In light  of the diversity  of regulated  risks,
no single number would make  sense for valuing life. 237  But it may make sense
to  set  benchmark standards of, for  example,  $10  million  per life  saved  as  the
presumptive  maximum  amount  and  $3 million  as  the  presumptive  minimum.
These  benchmarks  might  be  accompanied  by explicit  permission  for  agencies
to  select  a  lower  or higher  amount  if the  agency  can  explain  that  special  cir-
cumstances  call for  it.

There is a crudeness,  however, in the very notion of "dollars per life saved."
A well-functioning  regulatory  state should not be interested  in  how many lives
are  saved,  but in  how  many  statistical  years,  or  how  many  decently  liveable
statistical years,  are  added by regulation.23 8  An agency would  do better to save
forty  statistical  years  than  it would  to  save  three,  even  though,  through  both
steps,  it might be taken to have "saved  a life."  Where resources  are  limited,  it
makes  sense  to  devote  resources  to  saving  people  who  have  the  most  good
years  ahead.  This judgment may  appear  controversial,  but  it seems  supported
by common  sense  and  economic  criteria.239  Hence  Congress  should  probably
set floors  and ceilings not for  lives saved but for life-years  saved,  with permis-
sion to  depart on the basis of justifications  that are  articulated publicly  and are
reasonable  on  the  merits.  For  life-years,  a  presumptive  ceiling  of  $500,000
might be  a reasonable  place  to start.  Of course  any floors  and  ceilings  should
be  accompanied  with  adjustments  for  inflation.

Without  a  figure  per life  or life-year  saved,  agencies  effectively  have  dis-
cretion to  weigh costs  and benefits  however  they  wish.  Congress  should  offer
some  guidelines  to  achieve  consistency  across  agency  lines.  At  a  minimum
Congress  should require  agencies  to  be  explicit  about  their  valuations,  so  that
these valuations  will  be subject to  legislative  and public  oversight  and review.

236.  Such  balancing  can  be  handled  with  some  fairly  straightforward  language.  See  note  233

supra.

4.  Substitute risks.

We  have  seen  that there  is a pervasive problem  in risk  regulation,  one that
is  only  now  receiving  public  attention,  and  one  that  was  not  adequately  ad-
dressed  in  the  proposals  before  the  104th  Congress.2 40  The  problem  occurs
when  the diminution of one risk simultaneously increases another risk.24 1  For
example,  fuel  economy  standards,  designed  partly  to  reduce  environmental
risks to life and health, may make  automobiles less  safe, thus increasing risks to
life and health.  Regulations  designed  to control  the spread  of AIDS  and hepati-
tis  among health  care providers  may actually  cost lives  by increasing the  costs
of health  care,  and thus  making  health  care  less  widely  available.2 42  Regula-
tion of nuclear  power may make  nuclear power  safer;  but by increasing  costs,
such  regulation  promotes  reliance  on  other energy  sources,  such  as  coal-fired
power  plants,  which  carry  risks  of  their  own.2 43  The  general  problem  is
ubiquitous.

As  I  have noted,  no provision  in  the  current  proposals  deals  directly  with

this  problem.  Congress  should  consider  a  new provision  to this  effect:

"(1)  Agencies  shall  ensure,  to  the  extent  feasible,  that  regulations  do  not
create  countervailing  risks that  are  greater than  those  of regulated  risks.
(2)  This  section shall  not apply if it is inconsistent with  the provisions  of the
enabling  statute  pursuant  to which  the agency  is  acting."

Such a provision would require  agencies to  ensure that overall  risks  are not
increased.  It would  not fundamentally  change  current  law.  But it would  be  a
modest  step toward  a more  coordinated  treatment  of risk.244

C.  Ambitious Goals

Thus far I have offered modest suggestions  that build on existing proposals.

Three  more  ambitious  strategies  would  accomplish  a great  deal more.

240.  H.R.  1022  does  contain a  reference  to  substitute  risks  in  section  105,  but  agencies  are re-

quired  only to  'consider'  such  risks.  H.R.  1022,  104th Cong.,  1st  Sess.  ยง  105(4).

241.  See  Breyer, supra note  14,  at  17  (explaining  that  the  ban on  EDB,  a grain  fumigant,  could
lead  farmers  to switch to other, more  dangerous  fumigants);  Graham & Wiener, supra note  61,  at  5-25;
Sunstein,  supra note  61;  text  accompanying  notes  59-70  supra (discussing  harmful,  unintended  conse-
quences  of regulations).

242.  In  American  Dental  Ass'n  v.  Martin,  984  F.2d  823  (7th  Cir.  1993),  the  court  upheld  an
OSHA regulation,  but commented  on OSHA's  failure to follow the "universal precautions"  requirement.
Id. at  825.  Judge  Posner explains:

OSHA  also  exaggerated  the number  of lives likely  to be saved  by  the  rule  by ignoring  lives
likely to be sacrificed by it, since the increased  cost of medical  care, to the extent passed on  to
consumers, will  reduce the demand  for medical care,  and some people  may lose their lives as a
result.

LEGISLATIVE  FOREWORD

1.  Rank risks and reallocate resources to  the most severe problems and

increase the executive's role in priority setting.

As  Justice  Breyer  suggests,  a  statute  could give the  executive  some  degree
of authority  to  divert  public  and  private  resources  from  small  environmental
problems to  large  ones,  ensuring  greater  cost-effectiveness  in  government  and
better  priority-setting. 245  There  are  some  dangers with  this  proposal-a small
group  of bureaucrats  should  not have  the  authority  to  decide  on basic  social
priorities.  Nonetheless,  a  greater  degree  of executive  priority-setting  would
make  sense.

Justice  Breyer's  approach  should be  qualified  by remembering  that people
are  legitimately  concerned  with  the  various  contextual  factors  discussed
above-the  voluntariness  of  the  risk,  its  potentially  catastrophic  character,
whether  it  is  especially  dreaded,  whether  it  is  equitably  distributed,  and  so
forth.24 6  Efforts at better priority-setting  received some modest  attention in the
104th  Congress;  but  the proposals  were  not very ambitious. 24 7

2.  Allow plans from  the private sector that show greater and more

cost-effective  reductions.

Often  the  problem  with  federal  regulation  is  that  the  government  lacks
knowledge  of the least  expensive  means  of producing  the preferred  regulatory
end.  If the private  sector were permitted to select the means,  it could do  so far
more  cheaply.  This  point has  been recognized  in  Europe and  Japan,  under the
general  rubric  of "environmental  contracting." 248  In  the Netherlands,  for  ex-
ample,  the  government  has  experimented  with  comprehensive,  multimedia  en-
vironmental  targets  for  pollution  reduction  and  has  developed  strategies  to
work  with  industry  groups  to  achieve  overall  goals. 249  As  part  of the  agree-
ment with  industry  groups,  the government  agrees  to  waive otherwise  applica-
ble  pollutant-by-pollutant  regulations,  and  to  limit  changes  in  requirements
during  the  length  of the  contract  period.

In  the United  States,  the EPA has taken modest steps in the same  direction.

Under  most  federal  statutes,  however,  the  EPA  cannot  approve  private
plans  as substitutes  for public mandates, even if the plans promise  better results
for  less  money.  Congress  should  move  in  the  direction  of allowing  private
substitutes,  so long  as government  monitoring  is maintained.2 52  A provision of
the June  discussion draft of the Dole  bill endorsed  this strategy, but because  its
relationship  to  other statutes  was  quite  ambiguous,  it was unclear  whether  the
provision  would  enable  agencies  to  waive  existing  statutory requirements. 2 53

3.  Regulate with incentives.
We have seen  that command-and-control  regulation  can be highly  dysfunc-
tional.  Sometimes  relevant  statutes  forbid  agencies  from  choosing  incentive-
based strategies  even where  such strategies would  be more  effective.  Congress
might move away  from  command-and-control  regulation  by  enacting  a statute
stating:  "Notwithstanding  any  other provision  of law,  an agency  shall  be  per-
mitted  to  use  economic  incentives  to  induce  industries  to  eliminate  or reduce
risks,  if it can  show that these methods will produce  at least  equivalent benefits
in a more cost-effective  manner."2 54  Of course,  such a provision could increase
the risk  of litigation  initiated  by self-interested  private  groups  seeking  to  stall
desirable  regulation.2 55  It could also  allow agencies  unenthusiastic  about regu-
latory  mandates  to proceed  with less  effective means  of achieving  compliance.
But  despite  the potential  for  abuse,  the problems  with  existing  command-and-
control processes-excessive  costs  and insufficient regulatory  benefits25 6-are
probably  sufficient  to  make  it worthwhile  to  move  in  this  direction.

STANFORD LAW  REVIEW[

[Vol. 48:247

A.  Cost-Benefit Balancing

One possibility, captured  in many of the current proposals,  is to shift in the
direction of cost-benefit  balancing for  all statutes.  Many current  statutes forbid
balancing  and call  for  absolutism.  Such  an  approach  is  not easy to justify.257
Thus  the  various  statutes  that  are  defined  in  terms  of health  or  technology
might  be  amended  to  call  for  cost-benefit  analysis.2 58  As  we  have  seen,  this
shift-in  the  direction  of  a  cost-benefit  state-responds  to  several  current
problems  with  regulation.  Moreover,  it is  important to  offer  some  criteria by
which to monitor  regulatory performance,  and cost-benefit  analysis  is probably
the best available  technique  for  embarking  on a form  of "national performance
review."

By  itself, however,  a  shift  towards  cost-benefit  analysis  would  be  only  a
modest improvement over the status  quo.  We have seen  that, as an abstraction,
cost-benefit  analysis  lacks  a  theory  of value.  If this  defect  is remedied  in  the
economist's  fashion,  by rooting  cost-benefit  analysis  in  the economic  criterion
of private willingness  to pay,  it becomes  quite  controversial  and indeed hard to
defend  as a global  approach.  Environmental  amenities  are  not best valued  by
aggregating  private  willingness to  pay.259

Apart from the question  of valuation,  engrafting  a cost-benefit  requirement
onto  current  law  is  only  a  modest  shift;  it  does  not  represent  a  sufficiently
fundamental  change  from  the system  of command-and-control  regulation.  Be-
cause  the  calculation  of both  costs  and  benefits  can  be  enormously  difficult,
requiring agencies  to  make the  necessary  inquiries  will  impose  large informa-
tional burdens  on government.  A  general  requirement  of cost-benefit  analysis
allows  legislators to take credit for  "getting  the regulators  under  control"  with-
out making  the hard  choices.  Such a  credit-claiming  device  hardly substitutes
for reinvented  government.

Imagine-to  take  a  rough  analogy-that  the Soviet Union  had  decided  in,
say,  1986  to  replace  an  "absolutist"  five-year  plan  for  producing  wheat  with
another five-year  plan,  one  that better recognized  the need  for balancing  com-
peting  variables.  This  step  might have  been  an improvement;  but  a five-year

257.  One  such provision  is  the  Delaney  Clause,  21  U.S.C.  ยง  348(C)(3)(A)  (1988),  which forbids
the  use of carcinogens  in  food  additives.  Congress  has enacted  several bans  on cost-benefit  balancing.
See, e.g., 42  U.S.C.  ยง 7409(c)  (1988)  (mandating  standard for nitrogen  dioxide concentrations); see also
Federal  Water  Pollution  Control  Act,  33  U.S.C.  ยง  1311(b)  (1988);  Clean  Air  Act,  42  U.S.C.
ยงยง  7475(a)(4),  7503(a)(2)  (1988  & Supp.  V  1993).  See generally National  Ambient Air  Quality  Stan-
dard  Regulations,  40  C.F.R.  ยงยง  50.1-.12  (1994).

258.  Critics  charge  cost-benefit  analysis  with  assuming  a  misleading  wealth  of knowledge.  See
Howard  Latin,  Ideal  Versus Real  Regulatory Efficiency:  Implementation of  Uniform  Standards and
"Fine-Tuning" Regulatory Reforms,  37  STAN.  L. REv.  1267,  1273-75,  1279  (1985)  (criticizing  propo-
nents  of cost-benefit  analysis  for their unrealistic  assumption  that all  environmental  conditions and con-
trol  strategies  can  be known).  It  is  of course  possible  that  cost-benefit  analysis  would  itself fail  cost-
benefit analysis; thus  technology-based  approaches  could be justified as a response to  government's lack
of information and proper  incentives.  Similarly, it is  possible  that health-based  standards  can be justi-
fied  by their  aspirational  and political  values-providing  a benchmark  to  which  even  dirty  places may
aspire.  These  ideas do not, however, argue  against the background rule I  defend above.  See text  accom-
panying  notes  226-244  supra.

LEGISLATIVE  FOREWORD

plan  based  on  governmental  balancing  is  no  less  a  five-year  plan  than  one
based  on  governmental  absolutism. 260  Governmental  dictation  of  outcomes
based  on  cost-benefit  analysis  is  better  than  governmental  dictation  based  on
absolutism,  but neither is  ideal.  A system  in which agencies  decide  what is to
be  done  only  after  considering  all  costs  and  benefits  is likely  to  be  time-con-
suming  and will  inevitably produce  large-scale  errors.  Such  a  system  imposes
enormous  data  collection  requirements  on  agencies  and  also  forces  them  to
make  difficult,  and  hardly  scientific,  judgments  about  basic  values.  This  ap-
proach  may well be attractive  to members  of Congress  seeking reelection, but it
is  not a  great  deal  better  than  the status  quo.

In  fact  it  would be  easy  to  imagine  a  generation  of dreary  cycles with  re-
spect  to  regulatory  reform.  In those  cycles,  conservatives  might call  for  more
balancing  of costs  and benefits,  more  procedures,  and  fewer  deadlines  for ad-
ministrators;  liberals  would  then  argue  against  cost-benefit  analysis  and  for
health-based  or technology-based  standards,  fewer procedures,  citizen  suits for
regulatory beneficiaries,  and stricter deadlines;  conservatives,  a few years later,
would  seek  greater procedural  requirements  and  more  attention to  costs;  liber-
als  would  respond  with the  familiar  litany;  and  so  on until,  say  2050.

Although  this  cyclical model  is  not a bad  description  of the  regulatory  de-
bates since  1980,  its continuation would represent an enormous  failure  of imag-
ination and creativity.  It would fix American policy  in the outmoded  debates  of
the  early  1970s,  before  the  outpouring  of learning  that  makes  the  "more"  or
"less"  debate seem so unhelpful.  A cost-benefit  state ought not to content itself
with  governmental  specification  of outcomes  after  governmental  cost-benefit
judgments  have  been made.  It ought  instead  to  create  incentives  for  nongov-
ernmental  actors  to  generate  information  and  to  produce  outcomes  based  on
incentives  generated  by  democratic  judgments.

B.  Pollution Prevention

In  the last  decade  many people  have  enthusiastically  embraced  "pollution
prevention"  as  the regulatory  strategy  of choice. 261  On this view,  government
should eliminate pollutants  from the market rather  than require  pretreatment  or
impose  technological  requirements  to  reduce  the harmful  effects  of pollutants.
Prominent  examples  of pollution  prevention  include  the  elimination  of  lead
from gasoline;  the phaseout  of chlorofluorocarbons;  government bans  on DDT,

260.  This is a Hayekian point based  on the government's informational  limitations.  Thus  markets
can  be justified  partly  on  the  ground  that  individuals  have  far  better  relevant  information  than  does
government.  See F.A.  HAYEK,  Tim  CoNsTuToN  oF LmERTY  106-120  (1960).

261.  See  BARRY  Co. NoN-R,  MAKING  PEACE  VrrH  m  PLAT  189-90  (1990)  (asserting  that
pollution  prevention  is the  only effective  environmental  strategy);  Barry Commoner, Failure of the En-
vironmental Effort, 18  ENvTL.  L. REP.  10,195,  10,195 (1988)  (noting that the lesson  of the environmen-
tal  effort is that pollution can be prevented).  See also Symposium,  Pollution Prevention, 29 GA. L. REv.

PCBs,  and  asbestos 262;  the  shift from  high-polluting  fossil  fuels  to  clean,  re-
newable  energy  sources;  and  restrictions  on  mercury  pollution  in  the  Great
Lakes  and  phosphate  pollution  in  local  rivers.

Why is  pollution  prevention  so  attractive  to  so  many people?  Enthusiasts
contend  that by preventing the production  or use  of certain  pollutants,  govern-
ment can make  much more progress in reducing pollution than it can by impos-
ing  technological  controls  or fixes. 263  The  proper  analogy,  it is  said, is to  the
contrast  between  prevention  and  cure.  We  know  that  cures  tend  to  be  both
more expensive  and less effective than preventive measures.  American govern-
ment has  focused  on cures;  it should shift to prevention.  From this perspective,
the  basic  cause  of environmental  degradation  is  current  technology,  above  all
fossil  fuels  and  modem  cars.  At the  same  time, the  capacity  of technology  to
diminish  its  own  environmental  damage  is  rapidly  becoming  exhausted.  In-
stead  of imposing  decreasingly  effective  technological  fixes,  would  it  not  be
better  to  take  steps  to  ensure  that  environmentally  harmful  substances  are not
produced  at all?

Often the  answer  to  this  question is  affirmative;  often pollution  prevention
is both feasible and  appropriate. 264  But as a global approach,  pollution preven-
tion  is  inadequate. 265  In  some  cases  pollution  prevention  would  impose  ex-
tremely high costs-including  environmental  costs-for little environmental  or
other gain.  Recall  here  that  a federal  court  of appeals  invalidated  one  of the
most  ambitious  of the  recent  pollution  prevention  strategies-the  ban  on the
manufacture  and use  of asbestos--on  the  ground  that:  (a) the  benefits  of the
ban  could not, in many sectors, be shown to justify the costs  and  (b) the ban on
asbestos  could  itself  produce  a  variety  of  environmental  and  health-related
problems  stemming  from  the use  of environmentally  inferior  substitutes.266

This example  can be  duplicated  in many other contexts.  Indeed  the goal of
pollution prevention,  if taken literally, would be a social  disaster.  For example,
an immediate  and wholesale  shift  to  electric  cars  might  seem the best way  to
prevent  air pollution  from motor vehicles.  But electric  cars are  now extremely
expensive,  and the costs, for workers  and consumers,  of a ban  on contemporary
automobiles  would plainly be  excessive.  In fact,  electric  cars produce  environ-

262.  But see Corrosion  Proof Fittings  v. EPA,  947 F.2d  1201,  1215-17  (5th Cir. 1991)  (invalidat-

ing  EPA  ban  on "for  all  practical  purposes,  all present  and future  uses of asbestos").

263.  See CommoNER, supra note 261,  at 41-44  (concluding that the best environmental  results are

LEGISLATIVE  FOREWORD

mental  harms  of their own 267 -a  potential  problem for many pollution preven-
tion  strategies.

In  these  circumstances,  pollution prevention  is  sometimes  worse than  cost-
benefit analysis  or economic incentives.  By imposing  a direct cost on polluting
activity,  economic  incentives  can  identify  the  circumstances  in  which preven-
tion  or cure makes  the most sense.  For example,  fees  imposed  on  the produc-
tion  of sulfur dioxide  may  lead some  companies  to  eliminate  sulfur dioxide;  in
any  case  the judgment  would  be  left  to  (appropriately  constrained)  market
forces.  Alternatively,  cost-benefit  analysis  might  show  that pollution  preven-
tion is  not worthwhile.

The appropriate  conclusion  is that pollution prevention  is often  a good reg-
ulatory  strategy,  but  that  it  cannot  be  adopted  in  all  or  even  most  contexts.
Whether  it is the  best solution  depends  on  the pollutant  in question,  the  avail-
able  substitutes,  and the  effects  of the preventative  approach.

C.  Free Market Environmentalism

Much  creative  thought  has  been  dedicated  to  using  "free  markets"  as  a
mechanism  for  promoting  environmental  and  other  goals. 268  To  free  market
advocates, the problem of environmental  degradation  stems from a simple fact:
the absence  of secure property  rights in  environmental  amenities.2 69  The crea-
tion  of secure  property  rights tends  to  reduce  environmental  problems.

There  is much truth to this  suggestion,  and there is considerable  promise  to
the  resulting  proposals.  If  environmental  assets  were  owned,  so  that  owners
faced  the full  costs  of excessive  development,  it is  likely that  excessive pollu-
tion  would  be  prevented.  In  many  settings,  free  market  environmentalism
points in promising directions.  Consider, for  example, possible amendments  to
the Endangered  Species Act, related to proposals  introduced  in the  104th  Con-
gress.  In  its current  form, the Act  creates  difficult problems for any landowner
who  discovers  that  his  land  contains  a  critical  habitat  for  an  endangered  or
threatened species.  Discovery of such a habitat subjects  the property to  a range
of limitations.270  Hence  a landowner  has  an incentive  either  to  lie  about  the
facts  or  to proceed  with  development  as  rapidly  as  possible  to  avoid  the  con-
straints  of the  Endangered  Species  Act.  It  would  be  far better  to  use  market
approaches  so  that landowners  are  rewarded  rather than punished  by a discov-
ery  that  threatened  or  endangered  species  need their  land.27 1

[Vol. 48:247

For two  reasons, however,  free  market  environmentalism  is  an incomplete
solution.  First,  it is not always  possible  to assign  ownership  rights.  Consider,
for example,  the problems posed by acid  deposition, the greenhouse  effect,  and
the  destruction  of  the  ozone  layer.  Economic  incentives,  based  on  market
thinking,  may be  preferable  to  command-and-control  measures;  but it is  diffi-
cult to  imagine  a  system in  which private  ownership  rights  are  fully allocated.
The  second  reason  is  more  theoretical.  Free market  environmentalism  de-
pends  on  the view  that the  market paradigm  should be  deemed  normative  for
purposes  of  environmental  protection.  Thus  the  key  question  becomes  how
much people,  as  consumers,  would  pay  for  environmental  amenities. 272  The
answer  to  that  question  defines  people's  "choices"  and  "values." 
Indeed,  for
free  market  environmentalists  it  is  hard  to  imagine  how  choices  and  values
might  otherwise  be understood.

But it is wrong  to take private  choices,  expressed in  the market  domain,  as
definitional  of preferences. 273  Private  willingness to pay in  the market domain
reflects  a  particular  setting;  it does  not  reflect  global  choices  or valuations.2 74
The  choices people make  are a function of the particular  role in which they find
themselves.  As  consumers,  people  make  choices that  diverge  from those  they
make as  citizens.  The  appropriate kind  and degree of environmental protection
raise  issues  that  should  be  discussed  by  citizens  offering  reasons  for  one  or
another  view.  This  democratic  conception  of environmental  protection  com-
petes with the market-oriented  view.  Of course,  a democratic  approach to envi-
ronmental  law  will use  market  incentives  in many  contexts,  partly because  of
the  advantages  of market  incentives  on  simple  democratic  grounds.

Moreover,  private  willingness  to  pay  is  undergirded  by  social  norms  and
existing  habits, and  these should probably  be  changed;  indeed,  in  the  environ-
mental context  they had  better  be.2 75  Consider,  for example,  the  issues posed
by  littering  and  recycling.  Social  norms  with  respect  to  these  issues  have
shifted dramatically  in the last generation.  Thus the act of recycling is now, in
many  communities,  taken  for  granted,  where  a decade  ago  that  same  act was
perceived  as  odd  or fanatical.  Or  consider  smoking.  A principal  issue here  is
whether  smoking  is  promoted  or  undermined  by  social  norms.  Large  reduc-
tions  in  smoking  among  African-American  teenagers  appear  to  have  been

brought about  by changes  in social norms.276  A prime purpose  of environmen-
tal  law  is  to  shape  norms  and  habits.  The  central  weakness  of free  market
environmentalism  is  that it removes  this  issue  from  the  agenda.

D.  Democratic Environmentalism

A  final  approach  would  base  regulatory  law  on people's  reflective  judg-
ments,  as  citizens,  about  their  basic  goals.  On  this  view,  the most  significant
problems  in  the  current  system  consist  of  interest-group  power,  myopic  re-
sponses  to sensationalist  anecdotes,  and inadequate  information.  A market-ori-
ented understanding  of the regulation  is  inadequate  because  it fails to provide a
forum for  public  deliberation.  Similarly,  a  purely  technocratic  conception  is
inadequate  because  it  devalues  the  need  to  rely  on  people's  reflective  judg-
ments.2 77  More  specifically,  the technocratic  approach  fails to reflect  the vari-
ous  qualitative  factors  that  influence  public judgments  about  risk-whether  a
risk is  voluntarily incurred,  equitably distributed,  potentially catastrophic,  espe-
cially  dreaded,  and  so  forth.2 78  And  as  we  have  seen,  there  is  a  difference
between  the judgments  people  make  as  citizens  and  those  they  make  as  con-
snmers;  in principle, the former are  the relevant judgments  with respect to pub-
lic  policy.

A good model for  democratic  environmentalism  is the Emergency Planning
and  Community  Involvement  Right-to-Know  Act,2 79  which  requires  the  crea-
tion  and publication  of a list of release  levels  for each  of more than  three hun-
dred  toxic  chemicals  that exceed  threshold quantities. 280  The  result is  a Toxic
Release  Inventory,  an  annual  EPA report  of toxic  chemical  releases  that  sum-
marizes  the  relevant  information.  The  publicity  has  two  desirable  conse-
quences.  First,  the  Toxic  Release  Inventory  gives  states  and  localities  the
information  needed  to  decide  whether  to  act  at  the  governmental  level.  The
Toxic  Release  Inventory  thereby  spurs  decentralized  political  action.  Second,
public  reaction  to  the  publication  leads  many  companies  to  pledge  to  make
voluntary reductions.  Thus the Monsanto  Corporation pledged a ninety  percent
cut within  four years,  and  AT&T established  a goal of eliminating  all toxic  air
emissions by the turn of the century; many other companies have produced new
waste  reduction  initiatives  as  well.2 8'

[Vol. 48:247

For democratic  environmentalists, 28 2  much  of the promise  of economic  in-
centives  lies  in  the  fact  that  they  promise  to  reduce  interest-group  power  by
removing  attention from the  question of means, which is so  clearly a recipe for
interest-group  struggle.  Economic  incentives also have the advantage  of focus-
ing  the  public's attention  on  the right  questions. 28 3  Hence  the  acid  deposition
provisions  of the  1990  Clean  Air  Act  are  a model  for  the  future because  they
reflect  a  democratic  judgment  about  outcomes. 28 4  The  much-criticized  (and
internationally  much-imitated)  National  Environmental  Policy  Act285  is  also  a
model from the  democratic  point of view, insofar  as it requires  the disclosure  of
environmental  consequences  before  the  government  can  act,2 86  and  in  that
sense  spurs political (but not judicial 28 7) safeguards.  It is especially  important
to  ensure  that public  judgments  are  adequately  informed.  A  system  in  which
the public  responds  to  misleading  and sensationalistic  anecdotes  only parodies
democratic  aspirations.28 8

Of course these are  stylized discussions  of abstractions  that must be applied
to  complex  policy  initiatives.  It is  best  to  approach  particular  problems  in  a
pragmatic  and  experimental  manner.  All  four  approaches  have  something  to
offer, and  they can be combined  in different ways  to arrive  at the best solution.
In  cases  involving  dangerous  substances  with  good  substitutes,  the  argument
for  pollution prevention  is overwhelming.  Where  private  ownership  is possi-
ble, free  market  environmentalism  may  well  be preferable  to  the  alternatives,
notwithstanding  the  theoretical  objections  offered  above.  In  some  situations,
cost-benefit balancing at  the government  level is unavoidable.  We  may believe
that  for  reasons  associated  with  democratic  environmentalism,  a  strong  com-
mitment to  the protection  of endangered  species makes  sense.  But even  if this
is  so, it  may be best  to  use  market-like  instruments  to  accomplish  democratic
goals-through,  for  example,  "habitat  credits"  that  reward  rather  than  punish
landowners  who discover  that their  land supports  the continued existence  of an
endangered  species. 2 89

Some  of the  most promising  modem  initiatives  are  rooted  in  democratic
judgments,  but at the same attempt time  to harness private  initiative and market
forces in the interest of those veryjudgments.  In this way it may be possible to

LEGISLATIVE  FOREWORD

accommodate  both  free  market  and  democratic  environmentalism,  nominally
opposed  foundations  that  could  make  a  creative  rapprochement.  This  is  the
direction  in  which  the most  productive  reforms  might lead.  They would  pro-
duce  a kind of cost-benefit  state,  but one that is neither purely technocratic  nor
entirely founded on the willingness-to-pay  criterion.  In such a state, regulatory
outcomes  would  be founded  on value judgments  that are  reflective,  reasoned,
and  democratically  developed.  An  approach  of  this  kind  would  synthesize
emerging  enthusiasm for  technocratic  tools  and for decreased  cost with the ba-
sic  American  commitment  to  deliberative  democracy.

VI.  CONCLUSION

The  election  of  the  104th  Congress,  together  with  the  Contract with
America, signals  that  the  nation  may  be  in  the  midst  of a  constitutional  mo-
ment.  At the very  least the  104th  Congress raised  more fundamental  questions
about  the national  government  than  at any  time since  the New  Deal.  Most  of
the key  initiatives were passed by the House but floundered  in the  Senate.  The
public  never  authoritatively  committed  itself to  such fundamental  change,  and
hence  the constitutional  moment, though signalled,  failed to  occur.  Whether  it
will  happen  in the future  depends  on the judgments  of the American  people-
on  whether  those judgments  will  be  made  with  the  firmness  that  American
institutions  require.

Even if regulatory reform  does not become  part of a constitutional  moment,
the  nation  is  embarking  increasingly  on  the  project  of  assessing  government
performance  by  asking  whether  the  benefits justify  the  costs.  The  regulatory
state  is  becoming  something  like  a  cost-benefit  state;  this  is  an  unmistakable
feature  of public  life  in many institutions  of American government.  In light  of
the chaotic  and  uncoordinated  character  of modem regulation,  this  is  in  many
ways  a salutary  development.  But it is  only  a start,  above  all  because  the  ab-
stract  ideas  of  "cost"  and  "benefit"  need  to  be  specified  by  some  theory  of
value.  In the  104th  Congress,  legislative  debates  over  regulatory  reform were
mostly  procedural  and unimaginative,  trapped  in  an increasingly  pointless  dis-
cussion of whether  "more"  or "less"  regulation is  desirable.  In the end,  almost
nothing  happened.

To  be  sure,  some proposals  would  have  improved  the  modem  regulatory
state  by  reducing  regulatory  excesses  and  encouraging  better  priority-setting.
In  addition, the  deliberative  process  of the  Senate  reflected  a  learning  process
in  which  poorly  conceived  provisions  were  deleted 290  and  better  alternatives
were proposed. 291  But for the most part, these proposals were  far less  sophisti-

cated and creative  than those that emerged from the executive branch, including
the  "reinventing  government"  working  groups.

A general  lesson  emerges  from  this phenomenon.  In the last fifteen  years,
the  executive  branch  has  embraced  a form  of cost-benefit  analysis  for  specific
purposes-to promote  better priority-setting,  to  move towards  market-oriented
tools,  to  exempt  de minimis risks,  to  attend  to  informed  public  judgments,  to
foster  voluntary  and  least-cost  compliance,  and  to  focus  on ultimate  results
rather than methods  and processes.  To  be sure,  there is much to  criticize  in the
efforts  of the  executive  branch.292  But all  in  all,  they  are  quite  promising-
certainly  more so  than  the various  bills that  attracted so  much  attention  in the
104th  Congress.

As we  have  seen, balancing is preferable  to  absolutism.  The point  is espe-
cially important in  light of the fact that with respect  to the protection  of human
health,  absolutism may actually be  counterproductive  and hence  far from what
it  seems.293  But  cost-benefit  balancing is an  abstract  idea that needs  specifica-
tion,  and  it  is  insufficient  to  graft  a  supermandate  of "balancing"  on top  of a
structure  of  command-and-control  regulation.  Future  congressional  debate
over  the  regulatory  state  should  not remain  frozen  in  a  discussion  of whether
regulation  imposes  excessively  high  costs  (it  surely  does)  or  whether  more
should  be done  to protect  people from a range  of harms,  including  risks to  life
and  health  (it surely  should).  Too  many proposals  in  the  104th  Congress  re-
flected too  little  of the learning  of the last twenty years of experience.  Embod-
ying instead the unhelpful  (though accurate) judgment that there is "excessive"
regulation,  they  attempted  to  clog the  administrative  process  with paperwork.
There  is an institutional  lesson from all this:  Congress is not well-equipped
effectively  to  redesign  the  regulatory  state.  The  executive  branch,  with  its
cadre  of experts  in numerous  substantive  areas,  is in a  better position.  For this
reason  it may be best for Congress to limit its efforts to providing broad  signals
about what  is wrong  and  to  allow  the  executive  branch,  within  limits, to  pro-
vide  solutions.  Statutes  that  permit  or  require  economic  incentives,  and  that
call  for  suitably  constrained  balancing,  may  be the  best that Congress  can  do.
But there is a substantive lesson as  well.  If there is  to be an Administrative
Substance  Act,  it should  build on the foundation  laid by recent  learning  about
regulatory  performance.  In the  process  it would  be  possible  not  only to  save
billions  of dollars  unnecessarily  wasted  on  current  programs,  but  also  to  save
many thousands  of lives.

A constitutional  moment  of the sort signaled by the  104th House  of Repre-
sentatives  deserves  far more  reflection  and  scrutiny  than the  House  itself was
willing to give it.  And a cost-benefit  state will have many questions to  answer,

LEGISLATIVE FOREWORD

especially  on underlying  questions of valuation.  I have suggested that a general
background  requirement  of  cost-benefit  balancing-a  substantive  super-
mandate-should  be enacted.  I  have  also  suggested  that this  background  rule
can  and should  be  rejected  through  clearly  expressed  legislative judgments  in
particular  statutes.  In  describing  costs  and  benefits,  Congress  should  allow
room  for  a diverse  array  of values,  and  not limit  agencies  to  the  criterion  of
private willingness to pay.  Many  statutes require  or permit agencies to promote
goals independent  of economic  efficiency,  and such  statutes  are  entirely  legiti-
mate.  Legislation that would  amend  all  such statutes  in favor  of the efficiency
criterion  would  indeed  be  quasi-constitutional  in  nature.  But in  a  well-func-
tioning deliberative  democracy,  such legislation would be hard to defend  on the
merits.

More  modestly,  an  Administrative  Substance  Act, amending  the regulatory
state,  should  include  the  background  requirement  I  have  described  and  also
require  agencies  to  act  in  a  cost-effective  fashion.  Congress  should  move  as
well in the direction  of requiring economic criteria  where the underlying  statute
is  best  understood  as  remedying  a  market  failure,  economically  defined.  A
cost-benefit  state,  understood  in  these  terms,  could make  large  improvements,
without  embarking  on foundational  reform  and without  answering  the hardest
questions,  by  offering  initiatives  that make  sense  under  any  reasonable  theory
of value.
