      <p>When historians write about historical issues associated with the
American Constitution, what is their goal? What are they trying to do? At
one stage the answer was simple: Offer an accurate description of the
facts. If it turns out that the Framers were good democrats attempting to
discipline potentially evil representatives by reference to the will of the
assembled people, the historian should simply announce that (happy)
fact. If, on the other hand, the facts show that the Framers were
manipulative, self-interested aristocrats seeking to limit the power of the public,
the historian's job is to say so.</p>
      <p>It is now much disputed whether and to what extent this conception
of the historian's role can be sustained.1 Of course there is no view from
nowhere; of course we all stand somewhere. Perhaps any historical
account, offered by someone in a particular time and place, will reflect
current preoccupations and potentially controversial assumptions. To say
the least, it is hard to avoid forms of selectivity in dealing with the past.
This possibility should certainly not be read for more than it is worth.2
No one ought to doubt that nations, including the United States, have
had a past; no one should doubt that there are really facts to which any
historical account must attempt to conform. But human beings see
history through their own filters, including their own assumptions, and the
result is, inevitably, something other than unmediated access to what
happened before. Whether this is a serious obstacle to the traditional
understanding of the historian's task is a large and disputed question.</p>
      <p>The traditional constitutional lawyer 3 tends to view the historian's
role in pretty conventional terms, as a search for "the facts."4 Often
historians have been sharply critical of constitutional history as done by
constitutional lawyers; when they are, they tend to see the constitutional
lawyer as an advocate, or as a debased historian, mining the past for insights

congenial to the lawyer's political convictions.5 One of my prime
purposes here is to respond to historians who think of the
historically-inclined constitutional lawyer in these terms. What I want to suggest is that
the historian and the constitutional lawyer have legitimately different
roles. The constitutional lawyer interested in history need not be a
politically motivated scavenger of real historical work, but a different sort of
creature altogether, with a special and not dishonorable function.</p>
      <p>In short, the constitutional lawyer thinking about constitutional
history has a particular purpose and a recognizable project, and what a
constitutional lawyer finds from history may, for legitimate reasons relating to
that purpose and that role, be quite different from what a historian finds
there. This does not reduce the constitutional lawyer to a mere advocate.
But it does mean that the function of the constitutional lawyer, even if
historically inclined, is properly and unembarrassingly distinctive.</p>
      <p>Nothing in what I have said, or will say, denies that the constitutional
lawyer owes certain duties of fidelity to the past. The constitutional
lawyer should not claim that the history supports a particular view when it
does not. The history can falsify much of what the constitutional lawyer
might seek to say, at least if the constitutional lawyer genuinely cares
about history. History imposes constraints on the lawyer as well as the
historian.</p>
      <p>If they are reflective, however, many constitutional lawyers will
happily acknowledge that they see their task not as uncovering the "facts,"
and not as simply describing what happened, but instead as interpretive
in something like Ronald Dworkin's sense of that term. 6 On this view,
constitutional lawyers, unlike ordinary historians, should attempt to make
the best constructivesense out of historicalevents associatedwith the Constitution.
They do owe a duty of "fit" to the materials;7 they cannot disregard the
actual events, which therefore discipline their accounts. But they also try
to conceive of the materials in a way that makes political or moral sense,
rather than nonsense, out of them to current generations.</p>
      <p>Everyone can see that the political or moral commitments of the
consitutional lawyer are an omnipresent part of the constitutional
lawyer's constitutional history.8 Why is this? Is it an embarrassment, or does</p>
      <p>HeinOnline -- 95 Colum. L. Rev. 602 1995
1995]
it reveal something disturbing or untoward? I do not think so. Political
or moral commitments play a role because of the interpretive nature of
the lawyer's enterprise, which involves showing how the history might be
put to present use. I think that this interpretive enterprise is typified, for
example, in Bruce Ackerman's work, though Ackerman often writes as if
he were simply describing the facts.9 I also think that this interpretive
enterprise is far from mere advocacy. The distinction requires more
elaborate treatment than I can offer here. For the moment, let me simply
suggest that the true advocate begins with a preestablished conclusion, is
interested only in persuasion, and allows his political convictions to
dominate everything that he says, whereas the historically-inclined
constitutional lawyer is interested in truth, and owes duties of objectivity and
fairness to the materials that he invokes.' 0</p>
      <p>With this in mind we come to the idea of a useablepast. 1 This idea
points to the goal of finding elements in history that can be brought
fruitfully to bear on current problems. The search for a useable past is a
defining feature of the constitutional lawyer's approach to constitutional
history. It may or may not be a part of the historian's approach to
constitutional history, depending on the particular historian's conception of
the historian's role. The historian may not be concerned with a useable
past at all, at least not in any simple sense. Perhaps the historian wants to
reveal the closest thing to a full picture of the past, or to stress the worst
aspects of a culture's legal tradition; certainly there is nothing wrong with
these projects. But constitutional history as set out by the constitutional
lawyer, as a participant in the constitutional culture, usually tries to put
things in a favorable or appealing light without, however, distorting what
actually can be found.</p>
      <p>Is the constitutional lawyer's approach-as I am describing it
herecynical, or dishonest, or debased, or reflective of a form of "history lite"?
The question cannot be answered in the abstract. Sometimes the charge
of cynicism, dishonesty, debasement, or "liteness" is entirely warranted.
For example, it is familiar to find a constitutional lawyer reading history
at a very high level of abstraction ("the Framers were committed to
freedom of speech") and concluding that some concrete outcome follows for
us ("laws regulating obscenity are unconstitutional"). This use of history
is not honorable. It is a bad version of formalism-the pretense that
concrete cases can be resolved by reference to general propositions, when in
fact some supplemental value judgments are required. 12

      <p>10. On how the notion of objectivity might be maintained despite the inevitability ofa
form of selectivity, see Putnam, supra note 2, at 180-200.</p>
      <p>11. See Akhil R. Amar, Of Sovereignty and Federalism, 96 Yale LJ. 1425 (1987).
12. An honorable species of formalism is defended in Frederick Schauer, Playing By
the Rules 229-33 (1991); this species of formalism calls for adherence to the literal text of
legal materials.</p>
      <p>Moreover, constitutional lawyers, preoccupied with the idea of a
useable past, may draw from history a lesson that comes pretty much entirely
from their own political commitments, and not at all from the history
itself. Certainly this is true of some of Robert Bork's use of history.'5
Bork's particular understanding of the so-called Madisonian dilemma
would not be appealing to Madison; consider Bork's suggestion, which
Madison would not find even plausible, that "majorities are entitled to
rule, if they wish, simply because they are majorities." 14 Some of John
Hart Ely's use of history-to support a "process-perfecting" conception of
judicial review-probably belongs in this category as well. 15</p>
      <p>On the other hand, constitutional lawyers should not argue that the
Constitution requires whatever they think a good constitution would say,
and as a way of disciplining legal judgment, constitutional lawyers should
look to history as a part of constitutional interpretation. Hence there is
nothing at all dishonorable in the idea that constitutional lawyers should
try to identify those features of the constitutional past that are, in their
view, especially suitable for present constitutional use. The American
constitutional culture gives special weight to the convictions of those who
ratified constitutional provisions, and though I cannot fully defend the
claim here, I believe that this interpretive practice is legitimate.
Constitutional law is based on ideas about authority, not just on ideas about the
good or the right. Constitutional history16 provides a way of constraining
legal judgments, invoking a set of provisions with at least some kind of
democratic pedigree, and providing a shared set of materials from which
judicial reasoning can proceed.17</p>
      <p>Nothing in these remarks is inconsistent with the proposition that
much in our constitutional history is bad and no longer useable. Some
aspects of constitutional history that are of considerable importance to

      <p>16. In this regard Flaherty rightly points to the importance of consulting the primary
sources, and of understanding the best and most recent work by historians. See Flaherty,
supra note 4, at 553-56.</p>
      <p>17. See David A. Strauss, Common Law Constitutional Interpretation (1994)
(unpublished manuscript, on file with Columbia Law Review). Of course there remains
the question of deciding at what level of generality the history is to be read. If read at a
high level, the history could authorize any decision at all; if read at a very low level, the
result would probably be useless for current problems. It follows that some kind of
intermediate course will make best sense, though I can hardly discuss this complex
issuethe issue of "how to read" the past for constitutional purposes-in this space. Doubts
about the possibility of the historical enterprise-how can we know what long-dead people
really meant? how can we possibly reconstruct their world?-seem to me overstated in
principle; but whether or not they are overstated, such doubts are hard for the
constitutional lawyer to entertain. For better or for worse, the lawyer participates in a
culture in which historical arguments are important, and it is therefore unhelpful to throw
up one's hands.
constitutional historians may not be so useful for constitutional lawyers.
Slavery was of course accepted in the Founding period; the Framers'
conception of free speech was almost certainly much narrower than anyone
would find reasonable today; the Framers' conception of equality would
permit forms of discrimination that the Supreme Court would
unanimously condemn. It is undoubtedly worthwhile for people to explore old
and sometimes unacceptable understandings for purposes of grasping
our own constitutional past.</p>
      <p>What I am suggesting is that the constitutional lawyer, thinking
about the future course of constitutional law, has a special project in
mind, and that there is nothing wrong with that project.' 8 The historian
is trying to reimagine the past, necessarily from a present-day standpoint,
but subject to the discipline provided by the sources and by the
interpretive conventions in the relevant communities of historians. By contrast;
the constitutional lavyer is trying to contribute to the legal culture's
repertoire of arguments and political/legal narratives that place a
(stylized) past and present into a trajectory leading to a desired future. On
this view, the historically-minded lawyer need not be thought to be doing
a second-rate or debased version of what the professional historians do
well, but is working in a quite different tradition with overlapping but
distinct criteria.</p>
      <p>My own interest in constitutional history'9 has largely stemmed from
an effort to re-evaluate two understandings common in the last
generation: that the Framers were principally or exclusively concerned with the
protection of preexisting private rights (the so-called Lockean
account20 ), or that they sought instead to set out the terms for
interestgroup struggle (the so-called pluralist account 2 1 ). These understandings
are quite inadequate.2 2 The Framers were republicans, and they were
republicans in the distinctive sense that they prized civic virtue and
sought to promote deliberation in government-deliberation oriented
toward right answers about the collective good. We cannot understand
our constitutional heritage without resort to these points.</p>
      <p>Republicanism, .thus understood, does not stand opposed to
liberalism, and indeed the opposition between republicanism and liberalism</p>
      <p>HeinOnline -- 95 Colum. L. Rev. 605 1995
has been quite damaging to the academic study of law (and to the
profession of history as well).23 But republicanism is sharply opposed to
interest-group pictures of governance. It favors instead a conception of
deliberative democracy. For constitutional lawyers as well as historians,
this is a matter of considerable importance. It bears on how we think
about the Founding document and it also relates to, though it certainly
does not resolve, a range of concrete constitutional controversies.</p>
      <p>Of course the republican tradition, in some of its incarnations, has
been associated with unappealing and unusable ideals-exclusion of
women, militarism, lack of respect for competing conceptions of the good,
and more. But the commitment to deliberative democracy is not logically
connected with those unappealing ideals; indeed, as an abstraction it is in
considerable tension with them. Constitutional lawyers who are
interested in republicanism need not be embarrassed by its contingent
historical connection with unjust practices. Nearly all traditions, and nearly all
expositors of traditions, can be shown to have had blind spots, and this
does not mean that it is wrong to attend to traditions and to their best
expositors.</p>
      <p>To be sure, there is a freestanding, nonhistorical argument for
deliberative democracy as a central political ideal.2 4 But for
constitutional lawyers, the argument for deliberative democracy should be
interpretive (in the sense I have described) rather than freestanding. That
argument draws substantial support from historical understandings. All
this leaves open a wide range of questions, to say the least; but I think that
it helps to explain the interest in republicanism as an historical
phenomenon from the standpoint not just of historians, but also of constitutional
lawyers in particular. I think that it also helps explain why the
constitu23. Liberalism and republicanism are opposed, for example, in White, supra note 5,
and Rodgers, supra note 5. Rodgers in particular identifies liberalism with an "inability to
imagine politics as anything other than interest group pluralism," and as committed to
"procedural neutrality." These understandings of liberalism, found in much historical
work, are extremely odd, and based at most on certain strands in liberalism. Those strands
should hardly be identified with the liberal tradition itself. Mill, Rawls, and Raz, for
example, thoroughly reject these ideas, and reject them because of their understanding of
what liberalism entails. See John Smart Mill, Considerations on Representative
Government (Gateway Editions 1962) (1861); John Rawls, A Theory of Justice (1971);
Joseph Raz, The Morality of Freedom (1986).</p>
      <p>To say this is not to deny that some republicans emphasized some goals that some
liberals tend to view skeptically. Some liberals, for example, emphasize the likely role of
self-interest in politics, whereas some republicans stress pre-modern ideas involving
corruption in government and the concept of "virtue." See White, supra note 5, at 7. But
these differences of emphasis should not be taken to suggest that the liberal and
republican traditions are at war or even distinguishable. Better antonyms to republicanism
are interest-group pluralism and conceptions of politics that see protection of private
rights as the sole purpose of constitutional structure.</p>
      <p>24. See, e.g., Joshua Cohen, Deliberation and Democratic Legitimacy, in The Good
Polity 17, 18-26 (Alan Hamlin &amp; Philip Pettit eds., 1990); Jfirgen Habermas, Three
Normative Models of Democracy, 1 Constellations 10 (1994).
tional lawyer's conception of republicanism need not entirely track that
of the historian.</p>
      <p>In his instructive article, Flaherty does not contest the view that the
Framers were republicans in a distinctive sense, nor does he challenge
the claim that the Framers sought to promote deliberation in
government. Insofar as he discusses my views, Flaherty's principal argument is
that I have stressed the Framers' emphasis on political deliberation at the
expense of their concern about rights and, in particular, about natural
rights. This is an important and complex issue, and it is good to see the
issue raised at the level of both historical understanding and
constitutional theory.25 By way of response, I offer a few brief remarks here,
intended not to resolve this complex issue, but to point to some directions
for future inquiry.</p>
      <p>Of course the Framers were committed to rights, and of course they
sometimes spoke in terms of natural rights. No eighteenth-century
American or British republican opposed rights, or saw the slightest
tension between his commitment to republicanism and his commitment to
rights. But-my first point-many of the rights that the Framers prized
were in fact a precondition for political liberty and thoroughly
understood as such.26 The right to freedom of speech is the best example, but
it is complemented by the right to ajury trial, the right to bear arms, the
right to private property, and much more. To this extent, an emphasis
on rights, and even natural rights, is not inconsistent with the emphasis
on deliberative democracy as a conception of republicanism. On the
contrary, a properly-functioning deliberative democracy prizes rights.
The Framers well understood this point.</p>
      <p>As Flaherty shows, the Framers did not believe that all rights, to
qualify as such, must be associated with political deliberation; and the
category of natural rights, extending beyond politics, was one with which the
Framers were familiar. But-and this is my second point-we should be
extremely careful with the idea of "natural rights" as it was understood in
the eighteenth century. It would be interesting to ask random
constitutional lawyers a trivia question: How many times does the phrase "natural
rights" appear in The FederalistPapers? The term occurs not a hundred
times, not twenty times, not ten times, but only once-and then in an
inconsequential place. 27 The notion of natural rights was much less of a
defining theme than many observers think.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the phrase "natural rights," when used, had certain
complex meanings, and it is important for modern observers to be careful in
reconstructing those meanings. Even those who believed in natural
rights need not have thought that there was a correspondence between
such rights and the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Recall that
Hume conceived of property rights as part of convention rather than
nature.28 Jefferson thought in the same terms. 2 9 When the Founding
generation spoke of "natural rights," it is not simple for twentieth-century
observers to understand what they meant. Often the term "nature" has
been identified with the best conception of human flourishing, rather
than with what would happen without governmental interference. This is
the classical understanding,3 0 and it had a strong influence on the
Framers. Perhaps the Framers, when speaking of natural rights, were
responding to those who spoke of the "divine right" of kings, and perhaps they
were deploying the rhetoric of "nature" for the distinct purpose of
meeting that way of seeing things.3 '</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding these points, Flaherty is undoubtedly correct to
point to the area of eighteenth-century "rights" as one that modem
constitutional commentators have inadequately understood, certainly in law.
There is a great deal more to do on this important subject. Perhaps
Flaherty's essay can help constitutional lawyers to embark on this long
overdue task. When they do so, it will probably be as part of their
interpretive enterprise, and what I am emphasizing here is that this enterprise
has special characteristics that distinguish it from the enterprise of the
ordinary historian.</p>
