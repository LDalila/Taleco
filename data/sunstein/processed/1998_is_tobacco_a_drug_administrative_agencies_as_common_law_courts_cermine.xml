      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>A. TheProblem</title>
        <p>Does the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have the
authorityto regulatetobacco and tobacco products?For a long time
the FDA said that it did not. In 1996, the FDA changed its mind.4
The principalissue raisedby this assertionof authorityis
whethertobacco qualifiesas a "drug."</p>
        <p>The issue is exceptionallyimportantfor both policy and law. It is
importantfor policy becauseFDA authorityover tobaccoproductsis
significantin itself, and also because a resolutionof the case will
provide the backdropfor statutorydevelopmentsand for any continuing
settlement negotiations between the tobacco industry and
government.5Obviouslynew initiativeswill be much affectedby the existing
power of the FDA. The question is important for law because it
raises large issues not only about the Food, Drug, and CosmeticAct
(FDCA)6but also about the natureof statutoryinterpretationin the
administrativestate. Above all, these questionsinvolve the respective
roles of courtsand administrativeagenciesin settlingthe meaningof
federallaw.</p>

articlesintendedfor use as a componentof anyarticlespecifiedin
For purposesof the FDA's assertionof jurisdictionover tobacco, the
key provision is clause (C), defining a drug as an "article[] ...
intended to affect the structureor any functionof the body."Is tobacco
such an article? I will be urging here that the FDA has the legal
authorityto answerthis question either no or yes, and that its yes in
1996is thereforelawful.8</p>

          <p>
            Ultimately, the FDA concludedthat tobacco productsare "combinationproducts"
involvingdrugsand devices. See FDA Regulations,supranote 4, at 44,403.I deal principally
here with the issue of whethertobaccoproductsqualifyas "drugs."An affirmativeansweris
the basicpredicatefor FDA authorityunderthe FDA's conclusionthatcigarettesare "devices"
because"theprimarypurposeof partsof the cigarette... is to effectuatethe deliveryof a
carefullycontrolledamountof the nicotineto a site in the humanbodywhereit can be absorbed."

NicotineContainingCigarettesand SmokelessTobaccoProducts,60 Fed. Reg. 41,453,41,522(Aug. 11,

21 U.S.C. ? 321(h) (1994).I do not discussthis provision,except to suggestthat if the FDA is
authorizedto define tobaccoproductsas a drug,it is almostcertainlyauthorizedto treatsuch
productsas "combinationproducts"subjectto its deviceauthority.SeeFDA Regulations,supra
9. In its remarkablybroadopinion,completedas this Article went to press,the courtof
appealsinvalidatedthe FDA regulationon variousgrounds.See Brown&amp; WilliamsonTobacco
Corp.v. FDA, Nos. 97-1604,97-1581,97-1606,97-1614,97-1605,1998WL 473320,at *1 (4th
Cir. Aug. 14, 1998). The points made by the court are discussedat separateplaces below; I
identify the elements of the court's analysishere, and also the places where these are
ad
          </p>
          <p>The moststrikingfeatureof the court'sapproachis its failureto dealwiththe language
of the key provisionof the statute,an especiallystrikingomissionin lightof the
court'sadmission that the "literal"languageof the statute stronglysupportsthe FDA. See Brown &amp;
Williamson,1998WL 473320,at *4. An especiallydisturbingfeatureof the court'sopinionis the
of the set of questions raised in a whole semester of administrative
law. Examplesof these questionsinclude the following:the power of
an administrativeagency to change its mind; the role of unenacted
legislation;the extent to which subsequentlegislative action can
divest an agencyof authoritythatit mightotherwisehave;the authority
of an agency to define its own jurisdiction;and the law-interpreting
power of agencies.The dispute over the FDA's authoritycould
ultimately be resolved on these or any numberof other grounds,and I
will take up these and other questionsin the courseof the discussion.
sheer numberof argumentsinvoked on behalf of its conclusion;the courtgives no sense of
whichof those argumentsare necessary,or sufficient,for the outcome.In anycase the
following arethe principalpoints.</p>
          <p>First,the courtsuggestedthatthe FDA's view was entitledto less thanthe usuallevel
of deferencebecauseit involveda determinationof its ownjurisdictionS.ee Brown&amp;
Williamson, 1998WL473320,at *3.Even if thissuggestionis correct,the FDA shouldprobablyprevail
underthe narrowrationaleurgedbelow,in PartV.C.1.</p>
          <p>
            Second,the courtfound"intrinsicevidence"againstthe assertionof authorityby
virtue of the factthatthe FDA didnot bantobaccoproductsafterfindingthey qualifiedas
combinationproducts.See Brown&amp; Williamson1,998WL473320,at *4-9.Thiswas a
structuralargument.The courtsuggestedthat drugsand devicesmustbe provedsafe and effectivebefore
they can be sold,see 21 U.S.C. ? 360c(a)(
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
            )(1998);the fact thattobaccoproductsare
dangerous and unsafe,but were not banned,showsthat the agencyhad acted unlawfully.The court
invokedvariousprovisionsrequiringcertainrestrictionson drugsanddevices,suchas a banon
misbrandeddrugsanddevices,see 21 U.S.C.? 331(a)(1998),anda
requirementthatdrugscontainadequatedirectionsfor use,see 21 U.S.C. ? 352(f)(
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
            ) (1998);see also 21 U.S.C. ? 352(f)(
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
            )
(1998) (requiringadequatewarningsagainstuse by children);21 U.S.C. ? 360c(b)(
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
            ) (1998)
(requiringclassificationsof devices intendedfor humanuse); 21 U.S.C. ? 360h(e)(
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
            ) (1998)
(requiring"ceasedistribution"ordersfor productsfound to cause
seriousadversehealthconsequences).In the court'sview, the FDA's failureto impose variousdisabilitieson tobacco,
includinga ban,suggestedthatthe FDA hadviolatedthe statute.
          </p>
          <p>This is, however,an extremelypuzzlingargument.If the FDA concludedthat some
substanceX is a drug,but did not ban X, it wouldnot follow that the FDA lacked authority
over X. It mightfollow thatthe FDA had actedunlawfullyin failingto ban X; withrespectto
tobacco,it mightalsofollow,fromthe court'sargumentst,hatthe FDA wasrequiredto engage
in variousotherregulatoryrestrictionsB.utthe FDA offeredreasonableargumentsfor refusing
to bantobaccoproducts,see infranotes 75-77andaccompanyingtext,or to requireinstructions
on how to use cigarettes,see FDA Regulations,supranote 4, at 44,520-21,andin any case any
inadequacyin these argumentswould not justify a conclusionthat the FDA lacked legal
authorityover tobacco products.It would merelyjustify a conclusionthat the FDA was
requiredto go furtherthanit did.</p>
          <p>Third,the court found "extrinsicevidence"againstthe regulationin the failure to
mentiontobaccoin the text or historyof the Act; in the FDA's historicalpractice;in
congressional inaction;and in Congress'stobacco-specificlegislation.See Brown &amp; Williamson,1998
WL 473320,at *9-19.Each of these argumentsis addressedbelow. See infranotes 53-61 and
accompanyingtext (discussingthe FDA's historicalpractice);infranotes 179-187(discussing
congressionalinactionor the lack thereof);infranotes
188-190(discussingCongress'stobaccospecificlegislation).</p>
          <p>My principalemphasis, however, will be on a conflict between
two differentstyles of statutoryinterpretation.'0The first is a form of
literalism:it stresses the need to interpret statutory terms in
accordance with their ordinary,plain meaningto speakersof
English."Because of the breadth of the language of the FDCA, this approach
strongly supports the FDA. The second style of interpretation is
more contextual: it emphasizes the need to understand statutory
terms taken in their original context, in accordance with
thencontemporaryunderstandingsof their meaning. This
argumentcreates serious problemsfor the FDA because the context of the statute
suggests a narrowerreading than the text alone. These two styles
produce conflicts in many different areas of statutory law. To take
just two examples, the dispute between them accounts for internal
disputes on the Supreme Court about the legality of
affirmativeaction undera law forbidding"discrimination"'a2nd also about whether
someone "uses"a gun when he sells it for cash.'3</p>
          <p>There is no simple or easy choice between the two approaches.
The literalist approach has many advantages. It enables diverse
judges to coordinate about both method and outcomes, prevents
guessing games about the nature of past contexts, and may well
impose good incentives on the enacting legislature.'4Its disadvantageis
10. The statementin thisparagraphis an oversimplificationa; morepreciseexplanationof
the two stylesmaybe foundbelow,in PartIV.C.</p>
          <p>11.</p>
          <p>Of course,thisidea producesmanypuzzlesof its own.In the contexthere, it is
intelligible becausethe definitionof "drug"does have suchan ordinarymeaningthat,as we will see,
becomesunsettledonly by an investigationof context.For a discussionof the possibilityof
literal interpretation, see FREDERICKSCHAUER,PLAYINGBY THE RULES:A PHILOSOPHICAL
EXAMINATIONOF RULE-BASED DECISION-MAKINGIN LAW AND IN LIFE 215-18 (1991)
(arguingthat interpretationis difficultonly in the rarecase). A recent case stronglyaffirming
the "plainmeaning"approachto statutoryinterpretationis Broganv. UnitedStates,118 S. Ct.
805, 808 (1998) (statingthatthe Courtshouldnot inferunwrittenlimitationsin an act when its
languagehas a clearmeaning).For a more detaileddiscussionof Brogan,see infranotes
161168andaccompanyingtext.</p>
          <p>12. See United Steelworkersv. Weber,443 U.S. 193,208 (1979) (holdingthat Title VII's
ban on racial discriminationdoes not encompassall private sector affirmativeaction
programs).For a more detailed discussionof Weber,see infranotes 151-153and accompanying
text.
that, by wrenchingstatutoryterms out of their context, it may well
lead to understandingsof statutory terms that are quite different
from those of the enactingCongressand may, in that sense, produce
significantmistakes."The chief advantageof the contextualapproach
is that it builds on a sensible understandingof how the governing
words were understood by ordinarypeople, including members of
Congress, at the time of enactment.16Its disadvantageis that it
increases the burdensof judicialjudgmentsand may involve unreliable
speculationabout the natureof the relevantcontext.</p>
          <p>In the abstract,the choice between the two approachesis very
difficult."A key question is whether Congresswould respondto the
literalistapproachin the desiredway, by legislatingmore
clearlybefore the fact and by respondingto any errors.To the extent that this
kind of legislative response is likely and to the extent that agencies
ought not be permittedto bringcoercivepower to bear in an area on
which Congresshas not focussed,a court-if forced to decide the
tobacco question on its own-might do well to hold that despite the
statute'sliterallanguage,tobacco is not a drugwithinthe meaningof
the FDCA because the term "drug"has a particular,highly
contextual meaning.'8But a courtpresentedwith this questionis not making
such a choice on its own.</p>
          <p>Formalism, 107 YALE L.J. 529, 557 (1997) [hereinafter Sunstein, Democratic Formalism]
(explainingJusticeScalia'sapproachto statutoryinterpretationas,in part,"aseriesof
information-elicitingdefault rules"which ideally "encourageCongressto state its will clearly").It
mightalso be justifiedas a low-costmethodof allowinga widerangeof people to convergeon
a particularoutcome.See FrederickSchauer,AshwanderRevisited,1995SUP.CT.REV.71, 74
(arguingthatthe costsof strainedreadingsof statutesso as to avoidconstitutionailnvalidation
outweighsthe benefits).</p>
          <p>15. See, e.g., Peter L. Strauss, On Resegregating the Worlds of Statute and Common Law,
1994 Sup. Ct. Rev. 429, 527 (criticizingthe SupremeCourt'stextualismfor yieldingdecisions
unresponsiveto the organicdevelopmentof statutes);RichardJ. Pierce, TheSupremeCourt's
New Hypertextualism: An Invitation to Cacophony and Incoherence in the Administrative State,
95 Colum.L. Rev. 749,752 (1995) (claimingthatthe recententhusiasmof the SupremeCourt
for textualismsometimesleadsto "findinglinguisticprecisionwhereit does not exist").</p>
          <p>The FDA has a large law-interpretingrole and it has made some
distinctive findings in the case of tobacco that support its
regulations.19In light of those findingsandthat role, courtsare not in a
position to make independent judgments but only to say whether the
FDA's interpretationis reasonable.20In the end, I will argue that
reviewing courts should uphold the regulation,principallyby reference
to the appropriaterole of contemporaryadministrativeagencies.</p>

        <sec id="sec-4-1-3">
          <title>C. Agenciesas CommonLaw Courts</title>
          <p>A generalclaim underliesthis conclusion:without much fanfare,
agencies have become modern America's common law courts, and
properly so. The basic task of common law courts is to specify
abstract standards(often involving reasonableness)and to adapt legal
rules to particularcontexts as facts, social understandingsof facts,
and underlyingvalues change over time. Operatingas common law
courts, agencies have, as they should, considerable power to adapt
statutory language to changing understandingsand circumstances.
This is a conventionalrole, for example, of the National Labor
Relations Board, the FederalTrade Commission,the
EnvironmentalProtection Agency, the Federal CommunicationsCommission,the
Department of Health and Human Services, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, and the Internal Revenue Service.21The
FDA's conclusion that tobacco is a "drug"is merely an unusually
dramaticand visible illustrationof this proposition.</p>
          <p>This general claim is connected to a more particularone: under
the best readingof the FDCA, tobacco may or maynot be a drug,but
the FDA has the legal authority to treat tobacco as a drug if it
19. The FDA firstdeterminedthatnicotinein tobaccoproductsis a drug.See FDA
Regulations,supranote 1, at 44,403.The FDA then adoptedregulationsafter findingthat
advertisementsfortobaccoproductswerespecificallyharmingyoungpeople. Seeid. at 44,466-95.</p>
          <p>20. This is the clear lesson of Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc.,467 U.S. 837(1984).</p>
          <p>21. See, e.g., id. (holding that the EPA's definition of the statutoryterm "stationary
source"wasa permissibleconstruction)R;ustv. Sullivan,500U.S. 173,184-189(1991)(holding

chooses to do so. One of my principalgoals here is to show why this
is no contradiction.In the process I shall have occasion to discuss a
number of importantinterpretivequestions:the relevance of
subsequent legislative events; the uses and limits of literalism;"t2he power
of an agencyto changeits mind after Congressand others have been
explicitly informed of the previous interpretation;2t3he nature of
statutorydefault rules, operating as "information-eliciting"rules or
as "intention-eliciting"rules;24and the exercise of dynamicstatutory
interpretationby administrativeagenciesratherthancourts.25</p>
          <p>I. PRELIMINARIES</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-4-1-4">
          <title>A. Notes on Smoking</title>
          <p>The problems posed by cigarette smoking might, of course, fill
many volumes. I offer here a brief discussionas a way of providing
some context. It was estimated in 1995 that about 529,000deaths in
the United States were attributableto smoking, about twenty-four
percent of total mortalitythat year.26"Second-hand"smoke is said to
be responsiblefor 3,000 deaths from lung cancer and 37,000 deaths
from heart disease annually,2though these numbers are
controversial.28In any case, there is general agreementthat smokingis by far
the largest of the preventablecauses of death,29and
"passive"smoking is sometimes described as the third leading preventable cause of
deaths.30</p>
          <p>A word about the prevalenceof smokingis also in order.3'As of
about 1993,25% of all Americanssmoked;27.7% of men and 22.5%
of women.32This representsa decline from 44.1% of men and 31.5%
of women in 1970.33 Smoking among adult blacks is 26%, very close
to that of adult whites at 25.4%,34but there was an
intriguinglysubstantial decline among blacks between eighteen and twenty-four
years old from 1965to 1992.In that group,the rate fell from 37.1%in
1965, to 31.8% in 1979, to 20.4% in 1987, to 4.4% in 1993, while the
rate among whites in the same age group fell from 38.4% in 1965 to
27.8% in 1987, but has remained more or less constant since that
time.35Almost 80% of smokersbegan to smoke regularlyat or before
the age of sixteen.36In 1995, 21.6% of high school seniors smoked, a
significantincreaseover the 17.2%rate in 1992.37</p>
          <p>The causes of reductionsin smokingare disputed.It appearsthat
education, advertisingrestrictions, reduction of peer pressure, and
taxes may all contributeto changes in smoking levels.38Social norms
may, for example, operate as subsidiesor taxes to smoking behavior,
encouragingpeople to smoke when norms are a subsidyand
encouraging them to cease smoking when norms are a tax.39Public
perceptions of greaterhazard,in response to governmentaction and other
public health warnings,also contributeto drops in smoking rates.40
Advertisingbans appear to have had a significanteffect in Canada,
Finland,New Zealand, and
Norway.41Antismokingadvertisingcampaigns appearto have substantialeffects as well. In
particular,campaigns intended to delegitimizesmokingby emphasizingthe dangers
of second-handsmoke and the industry'smanipulationof smokers

deed, the only real assertionof FDA authorityover tobaccoproducts
prior to that time occurredin 1959,when the since-renamedFederal
Drug Administrationclaimed authority only because certain
cigarette companies had advertised that their cigarettes would reduce
body weight."5Between 1963 and 1988, FDA officials said explicitly
that tobacco products did not otherwise qualify as drugs, devices,
foods, or cosmetics.5T4hus, the FDA Commissionertestified in 1972
that cigaretteswould be counted as drugsif, and only if, claimsabout
beneficialphysicaleffects were made on their behalf;"t5hat is to say
that cigaretteswould qualifyas drugsonly if tobacco
companiesmarketed them by reference to their beneficial effects on the human
body. This view was consistentlymaintainedthrough1988.56</p>
        <p>
          In an importantdecisionin the late 1970s,the FDA
rejectedpetitions by an anti-smokinggroup-Action on Smokingand
Healthto regulate cigarettesas drugs.57The FDA concluded that there was
insufficient evidence that cigarettes were "intended"to affect the
structureor functionof the body.58By this, the FDA meant that those
who sold cigarettes did not "intend,"by express representationor

element in this statutory definition.")).
otherwise, to affect people's bodies. Such an intention could, of
course,be found when cigaretteswere marketedand sold as a means
of reducing weight, but not in the ordinary course of sale.59The
FDA's decision was upheld on appeal.60The court said that the
FDCA authorizedthe FDA to regulatetobacco only if tobacco
companies were marketingcigarettesby reference to
variousphysiological benefits of smoking,and if most smokersused a particularbrand
of cigarettespartlybecause of those supposedbenefits.61</p>
        <p>In 1988,the AmericanHeartAssociation and other publichealth
organizationspetitioned the FDA to regulate low-tar cigarettes as
drugs.The FDA respondedby announcingits intentionto reconsider
whetherit had jurisdictionover cigarettesand smokeless tobacco. In
1996, the FDA concluded that it did indeed have jurisdictionin a
dense reportof some seven hundredpages.62</p>
        <p>The scientificand politicalbackgroundleadingto this decisionis
undoubtedlyworth an article, or perhaps a book, of its own.63 For
present purposes,two points seem both clear and highly relevant to
the legal issue. First,this was an extremelyvisible politicalissue, one
in which the President himself was heavily involved and one that
played a seriouspartin the presidentialelection of 1996."Second,the
FDA's decisionwould not have been possible without a great deal of
relatively new evidence about the effects of nicotine and the
intentions of the tobaccoindustry.The evidence suggestedthat smokingis
responsiblefor more than400,000prematuredeathsper year.65It also
suggested that tobacco companies were well aware of the adverse

61. See id.
physical effects of smoking.66The FDA stressed its conviction by
statingthat smokingwas a far more importantpublichealthproblem
than those to which it ordinarilydevoted its attention. Thus, in its
own statement,the FDA said that smokingcausesmore
deathsannually in the United StatesthanAIDS, car accidents,murders,suicides,
fires, alcohol, and illegal drugscombined.67Nonetheless, about fifty
million Americans continue to smoke cigarettes, and 3,000 minors
beginto smoke everyday."</p>
        <p>With respect to the jurisdictionalissue, the FDA supportedits
view with two central conclusions.First, it said that tobacco affects
the structureor function of the body because (a) it causes and
sustains addiction,(b) it has mood-alteringaffects, such as stimulation
and tranquilization,and (c) it controlsweight.69Second,and most
importantfor purposesof its changein view, the FDA stressedthat
tobacco productsare intended to have these effects.70This conclusion
resulted from new evidence of the foreseeability of these various
physicaleffects, new evidence of consumeruse, and new evidence of
manufacturerintent, stemmingfrom three decades of
industrystatementsandresearch.71</p>
        <p>The FDA emphasizedthat the situation had changed
dramaticallyfrom 1980,72when no majorhealth organizationhad determined
that nicotinewas addictive,to 1995,by whichtime most majorpublic
health organizations-including the American
PsychiatricAssociation, the U.S. SurgeonGeneral,and the
AmericanPsychologicalAssociation-had concluded that tobacco was addictive.73There was
also a great deal of emerging evidence, since 1980, to support this
conclusion-and the conclusionthat smokinghad variousstimulating
andsedatingeffects, effects intendedby tobaccocompanies.74
66. See, e.g., id. at 44,870-71 (discussing internal memoranda circulating within the R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. which made reference to the "undesirable" physical effects of smoking).</p>
        <p>67. See id. at 44,398. Note, however, that smoking may also control behavior that would
otherwise lead to premature deaths, such as obesity; the figure of 400,000 lives lost does not
take account of losses that would be produced in any case, as a result of substitute or offsetting
behavior.</p>

74. A set of internal documents showed that tobacco manufacturers had called nicotine</p>
        <p>The FDA did not, however, ban nicotine.75It concluded that a
ban would be ineffective, because it would produce black markets
and smuggling,and that it would be undesirable,because it would
create adverse health consequences for the millions now dependent
on nicotine.76It decided that the best response would be to prevent
childrenand adolescentsfrom beginningto use cigarettesat all.77To
this end, the FDA invoked its "restricteddevice" authority78and
adopted a regulatorystrategywith two principalcomponents.79First,
the FDA attemptedto limit the access of young people to cigarettes
in the following ways:by prohibitingthe sale of cigarettesto people
under eighteen years of age; by requiringretailers to check
photographicidentification;by banningfree samples;by requiringretailers
to remove self-servicedisplays;and by prohibitingthe use of vending
machinesfor selling cigarettes."S8econd, the FDA attemptedto limit
the desire of young people to smoke by restrictingcigarette
advertising and promotion. The restrictionsincluded a requirementthat
advertisinguse a black and white, text-only format;81a ban on
outdoor advertisingnear schools and playgrounds;8a2prohibitionon the
sale or distributionof non-tobaccoproducts,such as hats or T-shirts,
with a tobacco product brand name or logo;83and a prohibitionon
tobacco brand name sponsorship of athletic, cultural, or similar
events.84</p>
        <p>II. TEXTUALISMAND HISTORY</p>
        <p>Now let us turn to the legal issues. The criticallanguage of the
FDCA defines "drugs"as "articles... intended to affect the
structure or any function of the body.""'Is tobacco an article that is
inhabit-forming, with the power to sedate or tranquilize its users. See id. at 41,591.</p>
        <p>75. My focus here is purely whether tobacco products can be regulated as "drugs," and
hence I do not discuss, except in passing, the more specific questions raised by the particular
way in which the FDA chose to regulate such products.</p>

begin by generatingan argumenton behalf of the FDA, emphasizing
the apparentlyliteralmeaningof the statutorytext and attemptingto
accountfor the changein the FDA's positionover time.

      <sec id="sec-4-3">
        <title>A. Text</title>
        <p>At first glance, the text of the definition of "drug"plainly
includes tobacco, or so a reasonableFDA, actingon the basis of
plausible factualassumptions,couldfind.</p>
        <p>
          The statute appearsto requiretwo and only two findings:(
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
          ) an
effect on the structureor any functionof the body and (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
          ) an
intention to producethat effect. Tobaccohas a series of effects on the
human body, at least on one readingof the evidence.Nicotine may
reasonablybe found to work as both a stimulantand a sedativeand also
to have addictiveproperties.On the question of intent, things are a
bit more complicated.What is the precise meaning of "intended"?
Does this termrequireknowledge,motivation,or somethingelse? By
itself, the text does not make this clear. In the context of tobacco,
however, there is evidence that tobacco companies not only knew
aboutbut also desiredthe variouseffects of nicotine.86
        </p>
        <p>Thus, the naturalreadingof the text appearsto be
stronglysupportive of the FDA. It suggestsnot ambiguitybut a relativelyclear
understandinglike that of the currentFDA. An ordinaryEnglish
readerwould probablyfind that tobacco is a drugin light of the two
statutoryrequirements.</p>
        <p>B. TheOriginalUnderstandingof FDA AuthorityOver Tobacco</p>
        <p>The text of the statutemaynot be decisiveif the traditionaltools
of statutoryconstructionlead to a contraryresult. In Part II, I will
discussthis point in connectionwith the strongestargumentagainst
the FDA. But it makes sense to begin with a simpler,more
straightforward,and, in a way, more obvious set of questions:What of the
original understandingabout whether tobacco fell within the term
"drug?"Does Congress'soriginalunderstandingof the place of

bacco argue against a literal interpretationof the text? What is the
importanceof the (exceedinglylikely) fact that the enactingCongress
did not intendto give the FDA power over tobacco?</p>
        <p>When the definition of "drug"was originallyenacted in 1938, it
seems clear at first glance that the term was not understood to
include tobacco products.87There was no discussion of the FDA's
authority over tobacco products in Congress that year, and the
silence is highly relevant:in view of the importanceand high visibility
of the tobacco industry,it defies belief to suggest that Congresswas
conferringthat authoritywithout debate or by inadvertence.It is
entirely reasonable to think that the battle over the 1938 bill would
have been far more intense if the bill was meant to give the FDA this
kind of regulatorycontrol;it is even reasonableto thinkthat a statute
givingthe FDA such authoritycould not possiblyhave been enacted.
Moreover, the FDA's predecessor agency said in 1914 that it could
not regulatetobacco productsunderthe 1906 Act,mand Congressdid
not enact an explicit proposal in 1929 that would have amended the
1906Act to cover tobaccoproducts.89</p>
        <p>Thus,it could be arguedthat the statutoryterm shouldbe
understood by reference to its originalmeaning,which did not include
tobacco. By itself, however, this argumentis quite weak. The basic
reason is simple: Congress enacted general words, not its beliefs about
particularapplicationsof those general words, and
Congress'sunenacted beliefs about those applicationsneed not control. When
Congress enacts such general words, it is usually their present meaning
that governs,90at least if the question is whether the agency charged
87. The qualification"at first glance"is necessarybecause it is unclearwhetherat that
time Congresswould have been taken to have referredto existing understandingsof what
countedas drugsand devices, or to have set out a generalconceptwhose particularcontent
would and shouldvaryover time, with new understandingsof facts and values. If the second
view,whichenvisionsan evolvingdefinitionof whatconstitutesa "drug"underthe Act, is
correct, then CoyneBeahm,Inc. v. FDA is rightlydecidedeven underJusticeScalia'sview of
interpretation,rooted, as it is, in textualism.966 F. Supp.1374 (M.D.N.C.1997). The courtin

thatCongress'sfailureto addresstobaccowithinthe Act when enacteddid not withholdFDA
authorityto regulatetobaccoproductstoday. See id. at 1380-81.In reality,it is unlikelythat
there was a generalunderstandingon Congress'spart aboutwhetherthe statutorydefinition
wasstaticor meantto changeovertime.</p>

with their interpretation may so conclude.9'History may help in
sorting out ambiguities, but when they are unambiguous,general
words are frequentlyappliedin ways that enactinglegislaturescould
not have anticipatedand would not, on their particular,time-bound
understandingof facts and even values, have approved.9T2he validity

Congressthat enacted FIFRA believed that the EPA could regulate
DDT. On the contrary,when introduced,DDT was thought to be
unproblematicand entirely safe,98and hence the enacting Congress
did not contemplatethat FIFRA would authorizeEPA regulationof
DDT. The EPA nevertheless possesses just such authority.Statutes
regulatinghealth and safety quite routinely contain broad language
authorizingagenciesto regulatearticlesor substancesif the statutory
criteriaare met. Whether Congressbelieved that the
statutorycriteria were met when it enacted the relevant legislation is beside the
point unless Congressembodied that belief in law. Consider,as well,
the prominentexample of Bob Jones Universityv. UnitedStates,9in
whichthe Courtheld that a publicpolicy exception to the categoryof
charitabledeductions disallowed deductionsfor gifts to schools
prohibiting interracial marriages-notwithstanding the fact that when
the charitabledeductionwas first enacted in 1918,segregatedschools
were thought entirely consistent with public policy.'00As the Court
wrote in 1998, "statutoryprohibitionsoften go beyond the principal
evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the
provisionsof our laws ratherthan the principalconcerns of our
legislators by which we are governed."'0T'hen the Court held that the
1964 Civil Rights Act bans same-sex harassment,even though the
1964 Congressdid not in the least have that problem in mind, or
intend to cover it.102</p>
        <p>We can make the point more plain by supposingthat in floor
debates in 1938,membersof Congressexpresslystated the view that the
Act did not authorize the FDA to regulate tobacco, on the ground
(for example) that tobacco did not create a serious health threat or
did not "affectthe structureor functionof the body."'03A scenarioof
this sort would be at least as strong and perhaps even stronger for
those attackingthe FDA regulationthan the actual case, for, in the
hypothesized situation, there would be explicit legislative history
against the FDA's view. Even if, however, there were an express
statement to this effect in the legislativehistory,it would not be

effects of some kind.'7T7he FDA's currentassertionof authorityover
tobacco is basedlargelyon a claimthattobaccocompaniesmade,and
intended to make, that kind of representation.178No doubtthis was a
change in the FDA's position, but there was some ambiguityin the
formerdisclaimerof authority,and there is somethingless than
complete discontinuitybetween the FDA's past andcurrentpositions.
        </p>
        <p>Second,the idea of ratificationor acquiescenceis strongestwhen
legitimatereliance interestshave been built up aroundthe previous
view. If, for example, private actors have ordered their affairson a
certainunderstandingof the law, then a changein that understanding
could defeat legitimate expectations.And while tobacco companies
have assumedthat the FDA would not be regulatingthem, the
landscape of regulationof the world of cigarettesmokinghas been
shifting rapidly(to say the least), and it would be extravagantto suggest
that the assertionof FDA authoritywoulddefeat
reasonableexpectations.</p>
        <p>Third,agenciesare, with respectto staredecisis,in a very
different position from courts. Agencies are permitted to change their
minds,especiallyunderthe SupremeCourt'sdecisionin the Chevron
case," on whichmore is said below. It is one thingto say thatjudicial
interpretationscan be "frozen"by legislativeinaction that might be
taken to representacquiescencein the judicialjudgments;this idea is
part of a strong principleof stare decisis for statutorymeaning,
designed to limitjudicialdiscretion.'8sBut agenciesare in a
differentposition, andwhen the changein view is
associatedwithchangedunderstandings of legally relevant facts, there is no problem with that
change.Indeed,such changesin view, even when they alterthe
interpretation of a statute, are perfectly acceptablewhen motivated by
judgements about values, as Chevronitself makes entirely clear.18
There, too, the agencychangedits interpretation,and there, too, the
interpretationwas made public,and Congresscould easily have been
made awareof it.182Here the FDA's change was
self-consciouslymotivated by new understandingsof the effects of tobacco and of
tobacco companies'intentionswith respectto those effects.</p>
        <p>These points would not be controllingif Congresshad endorsed
or ratifiedthe FDA's priorposition. How might any such ratification
have come about?There are two separatepossibilities:Congressmay
have ratifiedthe FDA's view by failing to enact proposed legislation
that would overturnit,183or Congress may have ratified the FDA's
view by enacting legislation that was preemptive or comprehensive,
in the sense that it reflected a settlement of the question of tobacco
regulation,a settlementof whichthe absenceof FDA authoritywas a
part.Let us examinethese points in order.</p>
        <p>To say the least, there are many complexities in
drawinginferences from the mere fact that Congressdebated whether to regulate
tobacco in certain ways, with the apparent understandingthat the
FDA would not be involved. Some cases have found a kind of
"acquiescence"in longstandinginterpretations;they suggest that a
settled patternof agency interpretations,which Congressconsidered
overruling but did not overrule, is relevant to judicial
interpretation.184This approachis especially reasonable where there has been
detrimentalreliance on the previous interpretation.But other cases
point in the opposite direction.'"C'ertainlyCongressdoes not
legislate by failingto legislate.'8T6he failureto enact certainbills involving
tobacco, by itself, does not divest the FDA of authoritythat it would
otherwise have. There is little authority, and properly so, for the
proposition that congressionalacquiescence in
administrativeinterpretations,in the form of inaction,works to bind an agency to those
interpretations.Nor is this a case in which the FDCA has been
reenacted against the backgroundset by the FDA's interpretation.18A7

claim that the FDA has been divested of authority by subsequent

        <p>C. PragmaticConsiderationsL:egislativeResponsivenessandJudicial
Capacity</p>
        <p>A naturalway to resolve the dispute between a more literal and
more contextualunderstandingis to ask some questions about
institutionalcapacity.First,which approachwould lead to more mistakes
and more serious mistakes? This is a question about "errorcosts."
Second,which approachwould lead to more costly and more difficult
decisions?This is a questionabout "decisioncosts."</p>
        <p>To approachthese questions,it is necessaryto refine the
distinction between the two approaches;they representa continuumrather
than a sharpdichotomy.Some literal interpretationswould be ruled
out by context, regardlessof one's general approach.This is true not
only for scrivener'serrors,'9'but also for terms whose meaning
becomes plain only by context.192 Context is alwayspresent and always
helps informthe understandingof meaning.In some cases the literal
meaningwould make no sense; even the most enthusiastictextualists
accept this point.193By the same token,
contextualinterpretationbecomes quite contentiousif it is understoodto entail a rejectionof the
plain meaning of the text on the basis of the legislative history.The
form of contextualismthat arguesagainstthe FDA is more modest:it
is merely a suggestionthat an apparentlybroadtext shouldbe
understood by reference to its purpose and backgroundand that the
context, including the history, supports a narrowerunderstandingthan
the languagealone suggests.The debate here is not between
rigidlit191. These are to be fixed via contextual interpretation. See SCALIA,INTERPRETATION,
supranote 107,at20-21.</p>

154-156andaccompanyingtext.</p>
        <p>193. JusticeScalia,for example,a self-describedtextualist,acknowledgesthat contextis a
criticaltool to be used in interpretingthe meaningof a word.See Smithv. United States,508
U.S. 223, 241-47(1993) (Scalia,J., dissenting)(arguingthat the majority'sliteraldefinitionof
the word "use"is inaccurategiven its ordinarycontextualmeaning);see also

eralistsand text-rejectingcontextualists-two pretty
absurdcampsbut between two emphatically reasonable opponents: those who
would stress the ordinarymeaning of the statutoryterms and those
who would stress contextualfactorssuggestinga narrowerview than
the wordsalone support.</p>
        <p>In ordinarycommunication,of course,literalinterpretationis
infrequent,andlikely unsuccessful:"don'tleave the house"(butwhatif
there is a fire?); "let'splay a game, any game you like" (but what if
Russian roulette is proposed?). In ordinarycommunication,people
understandwords very much in context, with reference to presumed
intentions.Genuine "literalism"is a provinceof androidsand robots
in science fiction,who do not reallyunderstandhow languageworks,
and of eight-year-oldchildren,who derive considerablehumor and
mischieffrom literal interpretation.'9T4he point suggestsa pervasive
problemwith literalism:it may generate mistakes,in the form of
inaccurateunderstandingsof Congress'sinstructions.We can talk all
we like of the difficulty of discovering the "intention"of a
multimemberdecisionmakingbody;the point stillholds.</p>
        <p>Thus, the defense of a contextualunderstandingdepends on the
view that it is likely to producemore accurateinterpretations,where
accuracyis assessedby referenceto Congress'sjudgmentsaboutwhat
it is seeking to accomplish.'95On this view, an emphasison context is
part of any approach to interpretationthat seeks to elicit actual
judgments and understandings.Contextual interpretation is thus
analogous to "market-mimicking"or "intention-eliciting"default
rules in the law of contract.'9I6n contractlaw, as in
statutoryinterpretation, default rules and interpretivestrategiesmight be intended to
figure out what the parties are likely to have wanted to have done.
Indeed, it would be possible to conclude that all understandingis
contextualandthatliteralism,in the tobaccocase or anywhereelse, is
obtuse, somethingto be used only when there is reason to thinkthat
the literalinterpretationhas a good claimto being the contextualone
too.</p>
        <p>194. Personalexperienceconfirmsthispoint!
195. Justice Scalia, importantly,is not a literalist;he counsels attentionto context. See
SCALIA,INTERPRETATIOsNu,pra note 107, at 37 ("In textual interpretation, context is
everything,andthe contextof the Constitutiontells us not to expectnit-pickingdetail,and to give
wordsandphrasesan expansiveratherthannarrowinterpretation-thoughnot an
interpretationthatthe languagewillnot bear.").</p>
        <p>196. SeegenerallyAyres&amp; Gertner,supranote 14 (discussingvariouspossibledefaultrules
in thelawof contracts).</p>
        <p>But this view is far too simple.'9Suppose, for example, that the
more contextual interpretationdepends on resort to the legislative
history, and that the statute's text alone, as enacted in 1938, cannot
supportthat interpretation.It is entirelyreasonableto think that the
text should prevail.A refusalto give the words their
ordinarymeaning may create bad incentives for Congress;perhaps a more literal
reading would encourage Congress to speak more clearly. A literal
reading may also greatly simplify the process of judicial judgment.
Freed from reliance on the ordinarymeaningof the text,
contextualist courtsmightproducemistakes,partlythroughsimple error,partly
through willfulness, even if some contextualist courts might also
make some better decisionsthan literalistones. In other
words,literalists cannot be perfect;but perhapsthey will be better, on balance,
than their adversaries.Here as elsewhere, the perfect can be the
enemy of the good. On this view, (reasonable,rather than science
fictional) literalism can be justified as analogous to an
informationeliciting rule in the law of contract,designed to force the parties (or
in this case, the Congress)to speak with greaterclarity.198It can be so
justified with the additionalclaim that if intention-elicitingis
important,literalismis no worse than the alternative,andperhapsbetter, at
least as a generalrule.199</p>
        <p>It is hardto resolve this disputein the abstract.An obvious
question is whetherCongresswill in fact respondto literalinterpretations
by legislatingwith greatercare andclarity;there is little evidence that
it will. Another questionis whether Congresswill respond to judicial
mistakes,and here there is no systematicevidence. These points
suggest that the contextual approachis more reasonable, at least where
the courtis confidentthat the resultinginterpretationis really a fairly
accurateconception of Congress'sinstructionsand where the notion
of contextual interpretationis not a guise for unreliable inferences
based on legislativehistory.</p>
        <p>This conclusion suggests that if the courts were deciding the
issue in the first instance, tobacco products could not be regulated
without a convincingshowing that they were being sold with some

          <title>D. A NarrowerReadingby theFDA?</title>
          <p>Is it possible to accept the contextual interpretationoffered in
Part III while, at the same time, upholdingthe FDA's treatmentof
cigarettesas drugs?Might the FDA endorse a
narrowerunderstanding of the statute and still prevail?This would be the most promising
route;it would make the basic conflict about styles of interpretation
irrelevant,or nearlyso.</p>
          <p>To the extent that the FDA is emphasizingthe
addictiveproperties of tobacco, this question is hard to answer affirmatively.If
tobacco companies urged that smoking helps to prevent colds,
cigarettes would fit withinthe contextualmeaningof the term "use."But
addictionis altogetherdifferent,since no one contends that tobacco
companies successfullyencouragedpeople to smoke on the ground
that smokerswould become addicts.Thingsare, however,a bit more
complicatedfor those challengingthe FDA regulation.In its ruling,
the FDA referrednot only to addictionbut also to two other
undisputed changesthat tobaccoproducesin the functionof the body:the
effects of smokingin producingboth tranquillityand stimulationand
the effects of smokingin producingweightcontrol.202Therecan be no
question that the FDA would have the power to treat tobacco
products as drugsif they were sold with the representation,expressor
implied, that they help people to controlweight.Nor can there be much
doubt that the FDA would be authorizedto treattobaccoas a drugif
it were sold as a method for producingstimulationor tranquillity.
Could the FDA find that these effects were intendedby
manufacturers and understoodby consumers,so that cigaretteswould be akin to
slenderizersafter all? A reading of the rationale in support of the
regulationssuggeststhat the FDA did make this finding.</p>
          <p>Thisis farfroma frivolousargument.Manypeople use cigarettes
because of their effects on the functions of the body-usually for

prevent weight gain. A reasonable person could find that
manufacturers intend these effects and that many consumers smoke with
these effects in mind. Indeed, common advertisementsfor cigarettes
can be seen to be emphasizing,explicitly or implicitly,the
tranquilizing and stimulatingeffects of smoking,203and there is evidence that
tobacco companieshave been entirelyawareof these effects.204Thus,
for example, the FDA reported survey evidence that over seventy
percentof youngpeople who are dailysmokerssaid that they smoked
for relaxation.20T5he narrowest decision upholding FDA authority
would emphasizethese points, which provide a much
strongerfoundationfor the FDA's assertionof jurisdictionthandoes addiction.26</p>

statutoryinterpretation,but it is also one of administrativelaw, and
the FDA's positionis muchfortifiedif we expandthe lens in this way.
In the modern era, most of the key work of statutoryinterpretation
is, of course,not done by courts,but ratherby federal agencies.Most
of these interpretiveacts never face judicial review, and those who
challengesuch acts face a high
burden.20R7ealisticallyspeaking,general and ambiguousterms are given their meaningby agencyofficials
who adapt those terms to changingfacts and values. Thus, the
business of a wide range of agencies-the NLRB, the FCC, the FTC, the

specificationof generalstatutoryterms,the resolutionof ambiguities,

          <p>The point is, of course, recognized in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., which, it is becoming
increasinglyclear, stands as the most importantcase about legal
interpretationin the last thirtyyears.2"Chevronholds that where statutes
are ambiguous,courtsshould acceptany reasonableinterpretationby
the agencychargedwith their implementation.210Agencies are to
prevail wheneverstatutes are subjectto diverse,plausiblereadings.This
idea is of course strongly supportiveof the FDA's position that
tobacco can be treatedas a drug.</p>
          <p>The central idea behind Chevronis that where
underlyingstatutes are ambiguous,Congressshould be taken to have decided that
agencies are in a better position to make judgments about their
meaning than are courts.211Agencies are in that better position
because, Chevronemphasizes,the President is generally in charge of
their policyjudgments,and hence agencieshave a kind of democratic

"elucidate" statutes). Although not on the Chevron Court, Justice Scalia argues that Chevron is
best taken to hold that the question of deference will be resolved by reference to Congress's
instructions. Of course, when Congress passes an ambiguous statute, it fails to give clear
instructions. Thus, both in light of the value of providing a clear background rule and because
Chevron is a reasonable understanding of Congress's views about relevant institutional
capacities, statutes will generally be read to require courts to defer to reasonable agency
interpreta212. In the Court's words:</p>
          <p>While agencies are not directly accountable to the people, the Chief Executive is,
and it is entirely appropriate for this political branch of the Government to make
such policy choices-resolving the competing interests which Congress itself either
inadvertently did not resolve, or intentionally left to be resolved by the agency
charged with the administration of the statute in light of everyday realities.</p>
          <p>Chevron, 467 U.S. at 865-66. In some ways, perhaps, agencies have a stronger democratic
pediagencies are, of course, influencedby shiftingpublicjudgments,and
their approachesare likely to reflect the President'sbasic
commitments.21T3his was, no doubt, true in Chevronitself, where the
costsaving innovation there at issue responded to President Reagan's
concern with expensive regulations. In the context of the tobacco
controversy,the point is highlyrelevant,for there can be little doubt
that the FDA's position is highlyresponsiveto the views of President
Clinton,who has made regulationof tobacco a centralissue, not least
in the context of the presidentialcampaignof
1996.214Chevronappears in this way to accept the suggestion that deciding how to read
ambiguitiesin a law involves no brooding omnipresencein the sky
but an emphaticallyhumanjudgmentaboutpolicy or principle.21T5his
suggestionwas of course centralto the legal realistmovement, but it
is now supportedby a wide range of people216and it obviously bears
on the question of whetherand how the FDA can interpretthe word
"drug."</p>
          <p>Chevronalso has a technocratic(as opposed to
democratic)justification:judgments about the best meaning of statutory terms may
well turn on an understandingof underlyingfacts. A decision about
which articlesaffect the structureor function of the body will
inevitably turn on judgments about facts, not only about the particular
consequences of using the relevant articles, but also on the
consequences, for regulatorypolicy, of a judgment one way or the other.
This point is closely connected to the question of whether the FDA
has authorityover tobacco,since the FDA's decisionturnedpartlyon

          <p>215. Chevron thus has much in common with Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64
(1938). Both cases involve a rejection of the view that federal courts could neutrally declare
"the law," and both cases, following that rejection, reallocate legal authority from federal
courts to other institutions. For a provocative general discussion of the "Erie effect," see
Lawrence Lessig, Erie-Effects of Volume 110: An Essay on Context in Interpretive Theory, 110

          <p>216. See DWORKIN,supra note 143, at 36-37. There is an interesting relation between
Dworkin and Chevron: both acknowledge the constructive aspects of interpretation, but
Chevron sees this as a reason for administrative rather than judicial judgment.</p>
          <p>217. Here, however, it seems mostly to be a political rather than technocratic judgment.</p>
          <p>In this and other disputes,the importanceof the
Chevrondecision cannot be overstated:in its relativelyshort period on the scene,
Chevron,a kind of counter-Marbury2f1or the administrativestate,
has been cited more frequentlythan Marburyv. Madison,Brown v.
Board of Education,2 or Roe v. Wade,220and, if present trends
continue, it may ultimatelybe cited more frequentlythan all those cases
put together.221Of course,there are limitsto whatcitationrates show,
but, at the very least, Chevronhas become the frameworkthrough
whichagencyinterpretationsof law arereviewed.</p>
          <p>For present purposes,the basic point is that in establishingthe
power of administrativeagencies to resolve statutory ambiguities,
Chevron has recognized that the resolution of such ambiguitiesis
largely a judgmentof policy, to be made by institutionswith
democraticaccountabilityand technicalexpertise.In this way, Chevronhas
granted agencies two important common law functions, those of
specifyingstatutoryterms and of adaptingthose terms to new facts
and values.The questionfor post-Chevronlaw has involvedthe
identificationof limitson those commonlaw functions.</p>

          <title>B. Deferenceand Updating</title>
          <p>We are thus left with the questionof whetherthe FDA is bound
by what may appearto be the most reasonableinterpretationof the
statutoryterms, taken in their context and understoodby reference
to the traditionaltools of statutoryconstruction,or whetherthe FDA
may adoptan interpretationthat,whetheror not the very best, seems
consistentwith the languageof the statute and that does not violate
any unambiguouslyexpressedwill of Congress.So phrased,Chevron
seems to supplythe answer:the FDA shouldprevail.</p>
          <p>The narrowestunderstandingof the FDA's interpretationis that
when an article has a range of physical effects, includingbeneficial
effects, when the manufacturerintendsthose effects, and when a
substantial number of consumerspurchasethe article because of those
effects, the articlesatisfiesthe definitionof "drug."It does not matter
that manyconsumersare unawareof or uninterestedin those effects;

following results: Chevron, 6252 references; Marbury, 3818 references; Brown, 3455 references;
and Roe, 4885 references.
the fact that many consumersare aware of them and smoke because
of them is sufficientif the manufacturerintends those effects. To
uphold the FDA regulation,this narrowunderstandingis sufficient.</p>
          <p>A large advantage of this route is that it does not threaten to
give rise to implausiblehypotheticals.Indeed, it is hardto specify
implausible outcomes that would follow from this understandingof
FDA authority or even from a somewhat more expansive
understanding.22E2ven a definition of exercise machines as drugs would,
under certain factual assumptions,fit well not merely with the
statutory text but also with context, history,and longstandingpractice.</p>
          <p>It is possible to drawfrom this discussiona more general lesson,
whichI can describeonly brieflyhere. In the modern era,
administrative agencies have become America's common law courts. In the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, common law courts, of course,
had a kind of updatingand particularizingfunction.In a common law
era, it was the job of common law judges to
applyincompletelyspecified legal doctrines to new contexts and to supply new
understandings of those doctrines,which were typicallyphrased as abstractions.
These new understandingssometimes amounted to reversals of
preexisting doctrines, both general and particular. Often, judges
schooled in the common law traditionundertook a similar approach
to statutory terms, as in the great cases of Riggs v. Palmer223 and
Churchof the Holy Trinityv. UnitedStates.22T4o some degree, courts
have exercised this common law function in the twentieth centuryas
well,22b5ut in a way that has been highly controversial.Some people
222. If the article in question is a food, it cannot count as a drug. See 21 U.S.C. ?? 321f-g
(1994) ("[A] food or dietary supplement... is not a drug... solely because the label or
labeling contains ... a statement [calling the food or dietary supplement a drug]."). Moreover,
exercise machines and other "articles" that are marketed as having beneficial effects qualify as
drugs even under the narrower, more contextual understanding; hence, these do not count as
implausible hypotheticals. It should be noted that there simply are not many cases of articles
that are ingested, that do not count as foods, that have various effects on bodies, and that it
seems unreasonable to think that the FDA may treat as drugs. Note that a recent statute has
expressly exempted various dietary supplements. See Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-147, ? 3, 108 Stat. 4325, 4327 (codified at 21 U.S.C. ? 321(ff)
(1994)).</p>
          <p>223. 22 N.E. 188 (N.Y. 1889) (rejecting a literal interpretation of a probate statute that
would allow a person's murderer to receive an inheritance from that person).</p>
          <p>224. 143 U.S. 457 (1892) (rejecting a literal interpretation of a statute when it was evident
that Congress did not intend the statute to be interpreted literally).</p>
          <p>225. Consider, for example, a fairly conventional case, American Mining Congress v. EPA,
824 F.2d 1177 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Congress had not clearly dealt with the problem of how to
handle materials held for recycling, and the relevant EPA regulation defined certain materials
involved in recycling as "solid waste." Id. at 1179. In particular, it said that spent materials,
have urged that it is entirely illegitimatefor judges to continue their
common law role,226while others have argued for a form of
"dynamic"statutoryinterpretation,227and still othershave gone so far
as to urge a judicialpower to nullifystatuteson the groundthat they
are out of accordwith the existinglegal landscape.228</p>
          <p>In the modern period, however, dynamic interpretation
issimply as a matter of actual practice-an administrativetask, not a
judicial one. This is least controversiallythe case when agencies are
deciding how to apply general terms to new problems or old
problems that appearin new lights.In the late
twentiethcentury,administrative agencies have undertakenmost of the functions of common
law courts, adaptinggeneral principlesto various contexts, often in
ways that produce substantialreversals.This is an
omnipresentfeature of the modern legal landscape. Considerjust a few examples.
The publicinterest standardfor regulationof the
broadcastingindussludges, scrap metal, and the like would be treated as solid waste if they were not directly
reused but were instead held as part of an industry's ongoing production process. See id. at 1180.
The EPA reasoned that materials that were stored, transported, and held for recycling were
associated with the same kinds of environmental harms as materials that were abandoned or
disposed of in some final way. The court of appeals struck down the EPA regulation on the
ground that the governing statute defined solid waste as "garbage, refuse, sludge ... and other
discarded material," id. at 1179. For the court, material held for recycling was not "discarded."
Id. at 1193. Citing the dictionary, the court thought that the "ordinary, plain-English meaning"
was decisive. Id. at 1184. If the question was an internal dispute on a court of appeals about the
best interpretation of a statutory term, perhaps the majority would be right. But the question
involved the validity of an EPA regulation, produced after a complex process involving a
number of political interests, an extended process of intergovernmental deliberation, and an
elaborate inquiry into the underlying issues of substance. Even if a court would be reluctant to adapt
the meaning of a term like "discarded" to fit with context, is it not hubristic for judges, not
elected and knowing little about the enormously complex subject at hand, to invoke
dictionaries (compiled, after all, by human beings) to invalidate executive branch decisions that cannot
reasonably be said to run afoul of any judgment made by Congress? The EPA's decision
followed a sustained period of public comment, and undoubtedly the government would be held
accountable for any decision about the reach of the enabling statute. If the EPA's definitions
runs afoul of dictionary decisions but of no actual decision by Congress, should it really be
struck down? See also, e.g., Industrial Union Dep't, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Inst., 448
U.S. 607, 659-62 (1980) (rejecting a literal interpretation of the OSH Act).</p>
          <p>226. See SCALIA,INTERPRETATIONs u,pra note 107, at 12-14. Justice Scalia questions
"whether the attitude of the common law judge-the mindset that asks 'what is the most
desirable resolution of this case and how can any impediment to [its] achievement ... be
evaded?'is appropriate for the work that [he does] and much of the work that state judges do." Id. at 13.
"All of this [judges interpreting the law in order to accomplish a goal] would be an unqualified
good, were it not for a trend in government in recent centuries, called democracy." Id. at 9.

try has been subjectto a common-law-likeprocessof specificationon
the part of the FCC, embodyingrecognitionof new values and facts.
Thus, the FCC originally created and then eliminated the fairness
doctrine, and new public interest obligations have grown up in the
wake of the elimination.229The EPA's regulationsfor protectingthe
public health through national ambient air quality standards are
hardlystatic;even if the governingstatutorytermis taken to be clear
and firm,the agency'spracticehas been otherwise.230The NLRB
operates, in practice,as a common law court, adaptingstatutoryterms
to new facts and values.231The principaljudgmentsabout what
qualifies as a "drug"have come from the FDA, not from courts, which
have played a supplementalrole. The FDA's assertionof jurisdiction
over tobacco is merely an unusuallyvisible and dramaticinstance of
this phenomenon.</p>
          <p>Is this shift undesirableor illegitimate?It might be argued that
the process of common law judgment by administrativeagencies is
unacceptablebecause agencies are subjectto the influence of
powerful privateinterests,or factions,while independentcourtsare far less
vulnerableto such influence. On one view, both the vulnerabilityof
agencies to factions and the interest of agencies in increasingtheir
own power and authorityargue againstthe common law analogy;at
least common law judges had, and have, the virtues of comparative
independence.The susceptibilityof agencies to "faction"is a
persistent theme in administrativelaw,232and those who emphasize that
theme would be likely to favorthe more
contextualinterpretationoffered in Part I, to seek express legislative authorizationfor the new
FDA interpretation,and to be unconvincedby the
pro-deferenceargumentI am urginghere.</p>
          <p>The basic claim on behalf of the transformationI am describing
is rooted directly in Chevron;it emphasizes both democratic and
technocraticvalues. When comparedwith common law
courts,agencies have a greater understandingof relevant facts, and they also
have a degree of politicalresponsiveness,whichis a virtueas well as a

potential vice. The common law role of agencies is a function of
specificationsof statutoryterms that result either from new factual
knowledge or from changesin values, or from some combinationof
the two. The reversal in Chevronitself-from a
smokestackdefinition of "source"to a plant-widedefinitionof "source"-was partlya
product of technocraticvalues suggesting that this strategy would
workbest;233it was also undoubtedlya productof politicalvalues and
interestscallingfor less costlymeans of
achievingenvironmentalprotection. To the suggestionthat this position means that some statutes
(more accurately,their terms in some applications)might be lost or
misdirectedas a result of new agency rulings,a response might be
given in Justice Scalia's words: "[L]ots of once-heraldedprograms
ought to get lost or misdirected,in vast hallwaysor
elsewhere.Yesterday'sherald is today's bore-although we judges,in the seclusion
of our chambers,maynot be au courantenoughto realizeit."234</p>
          <p>The FDCA was of course writtenmany years ago, and it defies
belief to suggest that there is, in the backgroundof that Act, any
clear or simple legislative intent23a5bout whether tobacco might be
counted as a drugin light of modernunderstandingsof the effects of
tobacco andof the understandingsanddesiresof cigarettecompanies
about those effects. The FDA is in an unusuallygood position to
obtain informationabout those effects, understandingsa,nd desires.Its
assertionof regulatorypowerhas alreadyreceivedandwill inevitably
continue to receive an enormouslyhigh degree of political attention,
from Congressas well as from the President,not to mentionthe
relevant groupsthat appearbefore the FDA itself. The
ordinaryunderstanding of the statutory text supports the FDA's position, and
nothing in subsequent developments in Congress has divested the
FDA of the authoritythat it would otherwisehave. In applyingthe
FDCA to tobacco, the FDA performeda lawful common law
function, one that also has a high degree of democraticlegitimacy.Where
Congresshas not spoken clearly,the role of the reviewingcourtis to

        <title>C. Countersto Chevron</title>
        <p>There are several possible responses to the argumentrooted in
Chevron.</p>
        <p>1. Jurisdiction.It might be arguedthat the FDA has, by its own
lights, made a jurisdictionaldetermination,and perhaps an agency
does not have, under Chevron,the power to determineits own
jurisdiction. As a matter of first principles,it is unclearwhether Chevron
deference should be due to an agency involved in a
jurisdictionaldetermination.</p>
        <p>This continues to be a disputed question.236On the one hand, it
might be thought that courts should not presume that Congress
intended to give agencies the power to decide the extent of their own
jurisdiction.23T7he likelihood of bias and self-dealing might well be
taken to argue againstdeference to jurisdictionaljudgments.On the
other hand, two points arguein favor of grantingdeference to agency
interpretationseven when jurisdictionis at issue.238First, a prime
argumentfor Chevronis its relative simplicity,and if courtswere to
attempt to distinguishbetween jurisdictionaland
nonjurisdictionaldeterminations,that advantage might well be lost. This is a thin and
shifting line; most assertions of agency power can be deemed

377-83(Scalia,J., concurring)(statingit is "bothnecessaryand appropriate"to defer to
agencies' interpretationof theirstatutoryjurisdiction).
"jurisdictional."Second, Chevronis in part a recognitionof the
comparative advantages of agencies over courts, stemming from the
agencies' greater factfinding power and electoral legitimacy, and
those comparativeadvantagesseem to apply to
jurisdictionaldeterminationsas well. An extension of jurisdictionis likely to reflect
politicaljudgments,assessmentsof underlyingfacts, or both;the
assertion of jurisdictionover tobacco productsis certainlya case in point.
In any event, the cases appearto have settled, at least implicitly,on
the view that jurisdictionaldeterminationsare not entitled to less
deference.</p>
        <p>It is also possible to question whether the determinationin the
FDA case is truly"jurisdictional"in the sense relevantto the dispute
over Chevron'sscope. To be sure,the FDA has labeledits
determination "jurisdictional."At the same time, is everyFDA decisionto
considersome articlea drug"jurisdictional"in the sense that it callsinto
question the applicabilityof Chevron?Perhapsthis determinationis
more in the natureof an applicationof a statutoryterm to a disputed
case than a judgmentthat the FDA has authorityover a whole class
of cases that may or may not fit within a statutoryterm. When the
FDA assertsauthorityover anyparticulararticleof commerce,its
assertion might be describedas "jurisdictional"b;ut if FDA assertions
of this kind are jurisdictional,then deference will not be due to the
FDA in a wide range of cases that call for distinctlyadministrative
competence.</p>
        <p>2. Changein Agency's Position. Before Chevron,agency
interpretationswere entitled to little or no deference if they were
inconsistent or if the agency's currentinterpretationdepartedfrom
longstandingagencyunderstandings.239After Chevron,however,the cases
are ambiguous,some suggestingthatinconsistencydoes not eliminate
deference and others suggestingthat the case for deferenceis
significantlyreducedif the agencyhas changedits mind.24H0ere, it mightbe
urged that the fact that the FDA has departedfrom a longstanding
interpretationis sufficient to reduce the level of deference under
Chevron.</p>
        <p>239. See Gossett, supra note 180, at 681.</p>
        <p>240. See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842 (upholding changed agency interpretation); INS v.
Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 445 (1987) (rejecting a new agency interpretation that was not in
line with congressional intent); Gossett, supra note 180, at 698 (examining cases in which the
agency interpretation was rejected for reasons other than the interpretation's revision).</p>
        <p>It probablymakes sense to say that a steady course of
administrative interpretationis entitled to an unusuallyhigh level of
deference. If the agency's course has been steady, then reliance interests
may have built up aroundit; there may be special reason to thinkthe
old interpretationmakes sense; and Congressand relevant interests
have not, by hypothesis, showed dissatisfactionwith it, even though
they have had some time in which to do so. It does not, however,
make sense to say that a new interpretationis entitled to no
deference at all. Chevronitself was a case in which the agency changedits
mind, partlybecause of politicaljudgments,partlybecause of
technical ones; consider, as well, Rust v. Sullivan,upholdingthe so-called
"abortion gag rule," a new administrative interpretation driven
largely by political judgments. The case for deference is of course
heightenedwhen the area involves a high degree of politicalvisibility
or technicalcomplexity,and the FDA rule involves both. I conclude
that the fact that the FDA changedits mind is relevant and justifies
less deferencethan an unbrokenpatternof interpretation,but it
provides insufficientreason to disallow the FDA from adopting a
reasonable understandingof the statutoryterms.</p>
        <p>3. Othercanons?Chevronis not of coursethe only canon of
construction.There are many others, and sometimes they trump
Chevron.For example,the idea that statuteswill be construedto avoid
serious constitutionaldoubts seems to defeat agency interpretations,241
in part on the theory that Congress,ratherthan agencies, should
deliberate explicitly on questions that are close to the constitutional
line. This notion operates as a more targetedandnarrowerversion of
the nondelegation doctrine,requiringlegislative focus on certain
issues. The notion that statutes will not ordinarilybe taken to apply
outside the territorialboundariesof the United States-a notion that
is also intendedto ensure legislativefocus on the
relevantquestionalso seems to prevailover agencyinterpretations.242</p>
        <p>If there were an applicable canon of construction that would
trumpthe FDA's interpretation,then the FDA shouldnot prevail.It
is difficult,however, to find any such canon in this case. To be sure,
the FDA's assertion of authorityover tobacco places some federal
241. See Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council,
485 U.S. 568, 574-75 (1988).</p>
        <p>242. See EEOC v. Arabian Am. Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248 (1991); see also California State
Bd. of Optometry v. FTC, 910 F.2d 976, 981-82 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (holding that a federal agency
may not displace state power through its rulemaking authority unless specifically granted the
power to do so by Congress).
authority in an area that has also been regulated by the states. It
would be implausible,however, to say that the FDA's decision
triggers a relevantcanon of construction,as in the idea that ambiguous
statutesshouldnot lightlybe taken to preemptstate law. No
countervailingcanonof constructiondefeats the applicationof Chevron.</p>
        <p>Compare,in this regard,the question of whether the FDA has
the authorityto restrict the promotion and advertisingof tobacco
productsthrougha ban on the sale to people underthe age of
eighteen, detailed verificationrequirements,bans on sales
throughvending machines,requirementsof black-and-whitetext-only advertising,
and prohibitionsof use of brand names to sponsor entries, teams,
sporting,and other events.24T3he relevantstatute allows the FDA to
"requirethat a device be restrictedto sale, distributionor use...
upon such... conditionsas the"FDA may prescribeby regulation.244
The FDA arguedthat restrictionson promotionand advertisingare
restrictionson the conditionsof sale, designedto ensurethe safety of
tobacco productsby preventingchildrenand adolescentsfrom using
them and becoming addicted to them.245The districtcourt rejected
this argument on the ground that "sale" does not include
"advertising"and with the suggestionthat "conditions"could not be
construedto allowrestrictionson advertisingandpromotion.246</p>
        <p>The analysishere suggests that that court was probablywrong
under Chevron:the statutehas considerableambiguityhere, and the
term "conditions"on "sale, distribution,or use" can reasonablybe
understoodto includerestrictionson advertisingandpromotion.The
court's decision would, however, be strengthenedif it were thought
that some or all of these restrictionsraised serious questions under
the FirstAmendment.A claim to this effect raisesmanyissues by
itself, and I do not believe that the First Amendmentobstacles are in
fact serious.24T7his is, however, a controversial view of the First

insufficiently serious to justify a rejection of the agency's interpretation. See id. at 203.

by way of summary,it may be useful to outline the most plausible
opinions and surroundingrationalesagainstand for the FDA (in
ascendingorderof persuasiveness).</p>
          <p>The FDA's regulation might be invalidated on the following
grounds:</p>
          <p>1. It might be held that in the view of the
enactingCongress,tobacco did not count as a "drug"and that this originalunderstanding
is decisive. This is the weakest argumentagainst the FDA because
the general terms are what matter, and because the original
understandingabout the applicationsof those terms were not enacted into
law.</p>
          <p>2. It might be held that the FDA's longstandinginterpretation,
and Congress'sfailure to enact legislation againstthe backgroundof
that interpretation,foreclose a definition of "drug"that includes
tobacco.This argumentis not entirelywithoutforce, but in the end, it is
unconvincing,because agencies are allowed to change their mind,
and Congressdoes not legislateby failingto legislate.</p>
          <p>3. It might be held that the FDA's longstandinginterpretation
and Congress'sactual enactment of tobacco regulationwork to
prevent the FDA from regulatingtobacco. This argumentis convincing
insofar as there is a direct conflict between the FDA regulationand
congressionalenactments. It also has some force as applied to the
regulation as a whole. In the end, however, it is also unconvincing,
because it is too close to an argumentfor an implied repeal and
because agencies should be entitled to change their minds about the
meaning of an ambiguousstatute in the face of response to new
understandingsof underlyingfacts (and new values as well).</p>

            4. It might be held that the contextualunderstandingof the
definition of "drug"suggeststhat to qualifyas such, articlesmust be sold
with some kind of representationof actual beneficial effects on the
humanbody and that tobacco is not, realisticallyspeaking,being sold
with any such representation.If a court were interpretingthe statute

            ) above. In light,
however, of the FDA's factualfindingsand the
appropriatejudicialposture in reviewingan agencyinterpretationof generalstatutoryterms
after Chevron,that argumentis not persuasive.
          </p>
          <p>On behalfof the FDA, the followingargumentsare available:
1. It mightbe held that the plain statutorytermssuggestthat
tobacco must be treated as a drug,as Action for Smokingand Health
urged long ago. This argumentis not entirelywithout force, but the
terms contain ambiguity,and the FDA should be authorizedto
decide otherwise,as it did until 1996.</p>
          <p>2. It might be held that the statutoryterms permit the FDA to
find both an actualeffect on the functionof the body, because of
tobacco'saddictiveproperties,and an intentionto affectthe functionof
the body, becauseof the knowledgeof those propertieson the partof
tobacco companies. This argumentis unnecessarilybroad, and the
contextualunderstandingof the term "drug"makesit at least unclear
whetherthe FDA could adoptthis interpretation.</p>
          <p>3. It mightbe held that the FDA has the authorityto
includetobacco within the category "drug"if and to the extent that the FDA
can point to tobacco companies'knowledge of the tranquilizingand
stimulatingproperties of nicotine and advertisingthat suggests,
explicitlyor implicitly,that smokinghas those properties.Thiswouldbe
the best approach,because it is the narrowestbasis for upholding
FDA authority.</p>
          <p>CONCLUSION</p>
          <p>As a matterof simple practice,administrativeagencieshave
become America'scommonlaw courts.The task of adaptingthe law to
new circumstanceso,f both value and of fact,is largelyan
administrative responsibility.Agencies specify general statutoryterms and are
engaged in continuingprocesses of both "updating"and
particularization.</p>
          <p>In view of agencyself-interestand the exercise of power by
selfinterested privategroups,this development is not without risks. On
balance, however, it is highly salutary. In an era that prizes both
democratic accountabilityand the technical knowledge that comes
from specialization, it is only natural that the process of updating the
law and adapting it to the particulars of individual cases will fall to
administrative agencies. Administrative agencies have, however,
become our commonlaw courtsin a distinctivesense. On the one hand,
it is legitimate for them to undertake relatively rapid changes over
time, accountableas they are to the currentadministration-more
legitimate than it is for common law courtsto do the same thing.249On
the other hand,the updatingandparticularizingfunctionsof
administrative agencies must be disciplined by statutory boundaries, by
"clearstatement"principles,and by requirementsof reasoned
decisionmaking, requirements with both substantive and procedural
components.</p>
          <p>These points very muchbear on the multiplegovernmentefforts
to regulatetobacco. The regulationof tobacco is best treated as a
political ratherthan a judicialtask (however active common law courts
have become in the context of tort actions). Statutory language is
best understoodcontextually,and,as a generalrule, ambiguousterms
should not be taken to cover cases far beyond the contemplationof
the enactinglegislature.As a matter of administrativelaw, however,
the assertionof jurisdictionby the FDA is a
largelyordinaryadaptation of general statutorytext to a particulararticle, understood as a
"drug"both because of new understandingsof facts and because of a
wide range of democratic pressures and influences. The FDA is
authorized to adapt the statutory terms in this way in light of the
general characterof those terms and in light of its findingswith
respect to the tranquilizingand stimulatingeffects of nicotine. This
argument,largelyinstitutionalin character,is the narrowestand, in the
end, the most convincingone on the FDA's behalf.</p>
          <p>On an independentreadingof the FDCA, there is an argument
that tobacco is not a "drug"within the meaning of the Act,
understood in its historicalcontext. But the best readingof the FDCA,
understood in the context of the modern regulatorystate, is that the
FDA has the authorityto concludeotherwise,andto treat tobacco as
a drugif it chooses to do so.</p>
