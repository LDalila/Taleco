Abstract 
 

Do  moral  heuristics  operate  in  the  moral  domain?  If  so,  do  they  lead  to  moral 
errors?  This  brief  essay  offers  an  affirmative  answer  to  both  questions.  In  so  doing,  it 
responds  to  an  essay  by  Gerd  Gigerenzer  on  the  nature  of  heuristics,  moral  and 
otherwise. While focused on morality, the discussion bears on the general debate between 
those who emphasize cognitive errors, sometimes produced by heuristics, and those who 
emphasize the frequent success of heuristics in producing sensible judgments in the real 
world.  General  claims  are  that  it  is  contentious  to  see  moral  problems  as  ones  of 
arithmetic, and that arguments about moral heuristics will often do well to steer clear of 
contentious arguments about what morality requires.  

 

 

 
 

For many problems, Gerd Gigerenzer celebrates heuristics. He believes that they 

are  simple,  fast,  frugal,  and  remarkably  accurate.  He  emphasizes  that  heuristics  can  be 

prescriptive, in the sense that they may well lead to good outcomes in the real world. In 

the  moral  domain,  Gigerenzer  is  properly  cautious  about  whether  heuristics  produce 

moral or immoral behavior. What I would like to do here is to emphasize the imperfect 

reliability  of  heuristics  in  general,  and  to  suggest  that  their  imperfect  reliability  raises 

serious cautionary notes about some of Gigerenzer’s broader claims.  

Let  us  begin  with  Gigerenzer’s  illuminating  remarks  about  the  "gaze  heuristic," 

which  enables  baseball  players  (and  others)  to  make  otherwise  difficult  catches. 

Gigerenzer, who has often explored  this  particular  heuristic,  is  quite  right  to  emphasize 

that  people  who  use  heuristics  are  often  not  aware  that  they  are  doing  so.  But  even  a 

casual understanding of sports requires some qualification of Gigerenzer's claims. Stupid 

tennis  players  tend  to  use  fast  and  frugal  heuristics,  which  contribute  to  their  stupid 

tennis.  Often  they  think,  for  example,  that  they  should  hit  the  ball  hard  and  deep 

whenever the opportunity arises—an intuition, or thought, that can get them into serious 

trouble. Stupid athletes adopt simple heuristics that make them dumb. By contrast, smart 

tennis players are immensely flexible, and they are able to rethink their rules of thumb as 

the occasion demands. The best athletes have an exceedingly complex set of heuristics, 

fast but not at all simple, which they deploy as the situation requires. The moral domain 

is  not  so  very  different  (see  Nussbaum,  2003).  It  is  pervaded  by  fast  heuristics,  as 

Gigerenzer suggests, but they often misfire, and good moral agents are aware of that fact.  

My  own  treatment  of  moral  heuristics,  criticized  by  Gigerenzer,  emphasizes  the 

immense  importance  of  moral  framing  and  the  possibility  that  people  use  “simple 

heuristics  that  make  us  good”  (Sunstein,  2005).  For  morality,  as  for  issues  of  fact  and 

logic,  it  is  important  to  see  that  many  heuristics  do  point  us  in  the  right  direction–  and 

hence to stress, as did Tversky and Kahneman (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) and later 

Gigerenzer, that heuristics can lead to excellent judgments in the actual world. If people 

believe that they ought not to lie, or harm innocent  people, they will often do the right 

thing—especially in light of the fact that case-by-case inquiries into the morality of lying, 

or  harming  innocent  people,  could  produce  self-serving  conclusions  that  produce 

grievous  moral  wrong.  (The  case  of  Nazi  massacres,  explored  by  Gigerenzer,  can  be 

understood as an example.) Moral heuristics, understood as simple rules of thumb, might 

well  have  a  rule-utilitarian  defense,  in  the  sense  that  they  might,  on  balance,  produce 

morally preferable behavior even if they lead to unfortunate results in particular cases. 

But no one should deny that in many contexts, moral and other heuristics, in the 

form  of  simple  rules  of  thumb,  lead  to  moral  error  on  any  plausible  view  of  morality. 

Consider, for example, the idea, emphasized by Gigerenzer, that one ought to do as the 

majority does, a source of massive moral blunders (see Sunstein, 2003). Or consider the 

fast  and  frugal  idea  that  one  ought  not  to  distort  the  truth—a  heuristic  that  generally 

works  well,  but  that  also  leads  (in  my  view)  to  moral  error  when,  for  example,  the 

distortion  is  necessary  to  avoid  significant  numbers  of  deaths.  Or  consider  the  act-

omission distinction, which makes moral sense in many domains, but which can lead to 

unsupportable moral judgments as well (Baron, 2004).  

Gigerenzer notes, usefully, that it may be possible to modify people’s judgments, 

including their moral judgments, by altering the background. The idea is hardly original 

(see  Sunstein  and  Thaler,  2004),  but  it  is  true  that  a  default  rule  in  favor  of  organ 

donations  might  well  increase  what,  on  one  view,  is  morally  desirable  behavior  (id.). 

Indeed  there  are  many  applications  of  this  point.  If  default  rules  matter,  an  employer, 

including the state qua employer, could dramatically increase charitable contributions by 

presuming  that  (for  example)  each  employer  would  like  to  devote  2%  of  wages  to 

charitable  causes.  Of  course  the  use  of  default  rules  to  steer  behavior  raises  normative 

questions of its own (id.). The only point is that default rules greatly matter to choices, 

including those with a moral component. 

Thus  far,  then,  Gigerenzer’s  general  argument  seems  both  plausible  and 

illuminating, and I am merely underlining the possibility that even good heuristics will go 

wrong, for morality as for other questions. But on an important issue, Gigerenzer seems 

to me to miss some of the complexity of moral argument. His objections to maximization 

theories treat moral judgments as involving a kind of moral arithmetic, and this is a most 

contentious understanding. 

To be sure, Gigenenzer is correct to stress the cognitive difficulties of undertaking 

a  full  ex  ante  calculation  of  the  consequences  of  social  actions.  Human  beings  do  not 

have unlimited cognitive abilities, and hence they are often unable to specify the effects 

of  one  or  another  course  of  action.  Gigerenzer  believes  that  satisficers,  using  moral 

heuristics,  have  important  advantages  over  optimizers.  For  some  questions,  this  is 

undoubtedly correct. But to understand the relationship between heuristics and the moral 

domain, much more must be said. Three points are especially important here. 

First:  Gigerenzer  does  not  mention  that  many  people  are  rule-consequentialists; 

they  know  exactly  what  Gigerenzer  emphasizes,  and  they  favor  clear  and  simple  moral 

rules  for  that  very  reason  (Hooker,  2000).  A  complex  consequentialist  calculus  might 

lead to error, even if it would be preferable if properly applied. Because people are self-

serving,  and  because  their  on-the-spot  judgments  are  unreliable,  they  might  do  best  to 

follow  simple  moral  rules,  or  one-reason  decision  making.  There  are  interesting 

relationships  between  Gigerenzer’s  understanding  of  heuristics  and  rule-utilitarian 

approach to morality. 

Second: Consequentialism can be specified in many different ways. Utilitarianism 

is one form of consequentialism, but because it require all goods and bads to be described 

along  the  metric  of  utility,  it  is  controversial,  even  among  consequentialists.  When 

Gigerenzer speaks of the limits of maximization theories, and even of consequentialism, 

he appears to be operating under a utilitarian framework, without exploring the problem 

of  plural  and  incommensurable  goods.  We  might,  for  example,  endorse  a  form  of 

consequentialism that sees rights violations (so understood on nonutilitarian grounds) as a 

set  of  (very)  bad  consequences  (see  Sen,  1982).  Gigerenzer’s  exploration  of  moral 

problems does not recognize the complexities in consequentialist accounts of morality. 

Third:  Many  people  are  not  consequentialists  at  all  (see  Scheffler,  1994). 

Consider the injunction to treat people as ends, not means, an injunction that runs afoul of 

many  versions  of  consequentialism  (but  see  Sen,  1982).  Hence—and  this  is  the  most 

important point—it is not enough for Gigerenzer to show that moral heuristics do a good 

(enough) real-world job of achieving what we would achieve if we were optimizers with 

unlimited  abilities  of  calculation.  Perhaps  some  heuristics,  in  some  contexts,  violate 

deontological commands.  

Return  to  Gigerenzer’s  first  example:  Should  a  Nazi  massacre  be  evaluated  in 

utilitarian  or  consequentialist  terms?  To  make  the  calculation,  does  it  matter  if,  for 

example,  there  were  many  more  Nazis  than  Jews,  and  that  many  Germans  had  a  great 

deal  to  gain,  economically  and  otherwise,  from  mass  murders?  Many  people  would 

respond that this moral atrocity counts as such whatever the outcome of a utilitarian or 

consequentialist calculus—and hence that Gigerenzer’s emphasis on the impossibility of 

ex ante calculations is often beside the point (or worse). Perhaps many moral heuristics, 

followed  by  most  people  and  even  most  soldiers  (putting  Nazi  soldiers  to  one  side), 

should  be  seen  as  fast  and  frugal  ways  not  of  satisficing  rather  than  optimizing,  but  of 

ensuring that people do what is required by nonconsequentialist accounts of morality. 

The  existence  of  plural  and  conflicting  accounts  of  the  foundations  of  morality 

makes it all the more difficult to argue that moral heuristics function well. If certain fast 

and frugal heuristics are defensible on utilitarian or consequentialist grounds, they might 

still  be  objectionable  from  the  moral  point  of  view.  In  my  view,  it  is  for  this  reason 

productive to explore heuristics that might be defensible, or indefensible, on the basis of 

any view of what morality requires, or on the basis of the least contentious views of what 

morality requires (Sunstein, 2005).  

Gigerenzer seems to think that moral heuristics might be shown to be prescriptive 

if  a  full  consequentialist  calculus  is  not  possible;  but  this  thought  too  quickly  treats 

morality as a problem of arithmetic. If morality ought not to be so understood, as many 

people  believe,  then  it  is  not  clear  what  is  shown  by  Gigerenzer’s  emphasis  on  the 

cognitive problems associated with optimizing. I emphasize that prescriptive treatments 

of  moral  heuristics  are  likely  to  be  productive;  but  they  should  steer  clear  of  the  most 

contentious arguments about the foundations of morality.
