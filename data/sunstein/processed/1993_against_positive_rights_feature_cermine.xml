      <p>lature in times of emergency and when the Parliament is
incapable of forming a cabinet. Some provisions indicate
that dissolution is considered a solution of last resort to
conflicts between the executive and legislative branches,
one which is to be avoided by all means. In fact, the
detailed preconditions in the Hungarian and Slovak
constitutions seem to make dissolution almost impossible. In
Hungary, Parliament must vote no confidence at least
four times during a twelve-month period, and in Slovakia
the cabinet policy statement must be rejected at least three
times in six months for the Assembly to be dissolved.</p>
      <p>These prerequisites coexist with other limitations. The
Romanian and Yugoslav constitutions prohibit
dissolution in the last months of the terms of President and the
parliament. The Hungarian President can dissolve the
Assembly only twice during his term, while Romanian
President can use it only once a year. Almost all the
constitutions of the emerging democracies stipulate that
the President must consult with other high officials and
politicians before opting for dissolution. While the
typical procedure is to consult the Speaker of the House, in
Hungary the President must confer with the Prime
Minister, the Speaker and the leaders ofall the parliamentary
factions. Some ofthe constitutions prohibit dissolution in
time of presidential succession. Even if all the necessary
preconditions are satisfied, an interim President does not
possess this power. The 1992 Interim Constitution in
Poland, among other novelties, contains a provision of
crucial importance-the President is under obligation to
dissolve the Parliament if the Legislature fails to adopt a
budget bill in the three months following its
introduction.</p>
      <p>Due to lack of space, this brief survey of the features
of rationalized parliamentarism is by no means
exhaustive. Two conclusions, however, seem clear. First,
rationalized parliamentarism requires great political skill of
the principals in the difficult process of transition from
totalitarianism to democracy. Second, the new
parliamentarism strengthens cabinets and prevents easy
no-confidence motions that can threaten political
stability and when used improperly might even invite
government paralysis, if unpopular officials use these techniques
to prevent the necessary changes that are underway.</p>

      <title>RIGHTS</title>
      <p>By Cass Sunstein
If we look at the actual and proposed constitutions for
Eastern Europe, we will find a truly dazzling array of
social and economic rights. The Hungarian constitution,
for example, protects not merely the right to equal pay
for equal work, but also the right to an income
conforming with the quantity and quality of work performed.
The Slovak constitution guarantees the right to a
"favorable living environment." Almost all of the actual and
proposed drafts include the rights to recreation, to paid
holidays, to food and shelter, to a minimum wage, and to
much more. A chaotic catalogue of abstractions from the
social welfare state coexists with the traditional rights to
religious liberty, free speech, and so on. (For details, see
my "Something Old, Something New," EECR, Spring
1992, page 18.)</p>
      <p>I think that this is a large mistake, possibly a disaster.
It seems clear that Eastern European countries should use
their constitutions to produce two things: (a) firm liberal
rights-free speech, voting rights, protection against abuse
of the criminaljustice system, religious liberty, barriers to
invidious discrimination, property and contract rights;
and (b) the preconditions for some kind of market
economy. The endless catalogue of what I will be calling
"positive rights," many of them absurd, threatens to
undermine both of these important tasks.</p>
      <p>Three qualifications are necessary at the outset. First,
the argument against these rights applies with distinctive
force to countries in the unique position of transition
.from Communism to a market economy. Other
countries, especially in the West, are in a much different
situation, and here it is by no means clear that social and
economic rights would be harmful. We may draw an
important and general conclusion from this suggestion.
It is often said that constitutions, as a form of higher law,
must be compatible with the culture and mores of those
whom they regulate. But in one sense, the opposite is
true. Constitutions can be understood as precommitment
strategies, in which nations use a founding document to
protect against the most common problems in their usual
political processes. Constitutions should therefore work
against a nation's most threatening tendencies. If this is
so, there may be a good case for subsistence rights in (say)
the United States, but not in Poland or Russia. On this
view, it is irrelevant, even if true, that many international
human rights documents contain positive rights. While
it isunclear whether these rights have done much good, it
is also hard to argue that they have produced any real
harm; but they may do exactly this for countries making
the transition from Communist rule.</p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>Constitutions as legal documents</title>
        <p>Second, there is a big difference between what a decent
society should provide and what a good constitution
should guarantee. A decent society ensures that its
citizens have food and shelter; it tries to guarantee medical
care; it is concerned to offer good education, good jobs,
and a clean environment. It undoubtedly makes sense for
nations in Eastern Europe to experiment with diverse
kinds of market arrangements and with various
strategies for redistribution (see John Roemer and Jon Elster's
article on page 38). But a constitution is in large part a
legal document, with concrete tasks. If the Constitution
tries to specify everything to which a decent society
commits itself, it threatens to become a mere piece of paper,
worth nothing in the real world. (Hence I think that
Herman Schwartz is incorrect to suggest that the
opposition to positive rights in the constitution actually amounts
to opposition to programs creating such rights; see "In
Defense of Aiming High," EECR, Fall 1992, page 25.)
Opposition to social and economic rights in the
Constitution does not entail a belief that nations in Eastern Europe
should eliminate social and economic programs that
provide crucial protection against the vicissitudes of the free
market.</p>
        <p>Third, not all positive rights are the same. The right
to education, for example, is more readily subject
tojudicial enforcement than the right to a clean environment.
Some of the relevant rights pose especially severe risks;
others are relatively harmless. But I believe that few of
them belong in Eastern European constitutions. Here's
why:</p>
        <p>Governments should not be compelled to interfere withfree
markets. Some positive rights establish government
interference with free markets as a constitutional obligation.
For countries that are trying to create market economies,
this is perverse. A constitution that prevents the
operation of free labor markets may defeat current aspirations
in Eastern Europe. Recall that the Hungarian
Constitution protects not merely the right to equal pay for equal
work, but also the right to an income conforming with
the quantity and quality of work performed. This
provision will have one of two consequences. (a) If the
provision is to mean something, courts will have to oversee
labor markets very closely, to make sure that every
bargain produces the right wage. We know enough to know
that government is ill-equipped to undertake this task.
Courts are in an even worse position to do so. Ifcourts are
going to oversee the labor market, it will be impossible to
have a labor market. (b) The relevant provisions will be
ignored-treated as goals or aspirations not subject to legal
enforcement. This isa better outcome than (a), and courts
in Eastern Europe should be encouraged to reach this
conclusion. But it is far from ideal to have a system in
which many constitutional rights are ignored.</p>
        <p>The Hungarian provision is an extreme example, but
similar problems are raised by provisions calling for
specified maximum hours, for paid parental leave, for paid
holidays, and much else. Many of these provisions may
make sense if they are placed in ordinary legislation. But
this is where they belong-not in the constitution. The
constitution should not undertake close control of the
private sphere, of civil society and economic markets. In
the West, the constitution generally does not apply to the
private sphere at all; it only regulates government. (The
emphasis on positive rights in the Eastern European
documents suggests the remarkable and quite general absence
ofany distinction between the private and public spheres.)
Perhaps some small companies in the East should be
allowed to get ahead by paying their workers a great deal in
return for long hours, or for less in the way of leave;
perhaps not. Perhaps medical care should not be
freeespecially for people who have the money to pay for it.
These issues should be subject to democratic debate, not
constitutional foreclosure.</p>
        <p>Many positive rights are unenforceable by courts. Courts
lack the tools of a bureaucracy. They cannot create
government programs. They do not have a systematic
overview of government policy. In these circumstances, it is
unrealistic to expect courts to enforce many positive rights.
Consider, for example, another provision in the
Hungarian Constitution: "People living within the territory of
the Republic of Hungary have the right to the highest
possible level of physical health." How could courts
enforce this right? The same problem appears for many
(not all) of the positive rights, including the right to work,
the right to a clean environment, and the right to training
for the disabled.</p>
        <p>To be sure, constitutions are not only legal
documents, as Schwartz points out. In the United States, the
identification of the Constitution with the decisions of
courts has been damaging to democratic deliberation.
Constitutions can be a catalyst for public discussion. But
in Eastern Europe, it is crucial to establish very soon that
whatever else they are, constitutions are indeed legal
documents-in the sense that an individual citizen may count
on the constitution to protect rights, whatever a police
officer, a legislature, or even a prime minister or
President may say. One of the enduring legacies of
Communism is a large degree of cynicism about constitutions-a
belief that constitutions may be pretty, but that they do
not have meaning in the real world. If the right to "the
highest possible level of physical health" is not subject to
judicial enforcement, perhaps the same will become true
ofthe right to free speech and to due process of law.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-2">
        <title>Undoing the culture of dependency</title>
        <p>The inclusion ofmany positive rights could work againstgeneral
current effort to diminish sense of entitlement to state protection
andto encourageindividualinitiative. I have said that a decent
society provides its citizens with food, shelter, and much
more. But if positive dispensations from the state are seen
as a matter of individual entitlement, there can be
corrosive effects on individual enterprise and initiative. This
effect can be seen in both the West and the East. The risk
of corrosion is no reason to eliminate programs that
provide for subsistence. But in today's Eastern Europe, it is
important to undertake a cultural shift through which
people will look less to the state for their support, and
more to their own efforts and enterprise. One way to
help do this is to provide social welfare guarantees through
ordinary legislation, and to reserve the constitution for
other matters. In this cultural shift, it will be understood
that the state furnishes, among other things, a safety net
for those who are unable to make provision for
themselves. A constitution that indiscriminately merges
guarantees of "justpay" and "recreation" with traditional
liberal rights is likely to sendjust the wrong signals.</p>
        <p>Many positive rights would do no afirmativegood, andthis
is a seriousproblemforincipientconstitutionalism.Even if all of
the foregoing is overstated, most of the positive rights
would not make things better for anyone. To be sure, it is
possible that such rights would affect legislative
deliberations, quite apart from judicial action. Perhaps the
existence of a right to a safe environment would prompt
legislatures to attend to environmental issues when they
otherwise might not. It is also possible that the existence of
positive rights or social aspirations will affectjudicial
interpretation of existing statutory provisions. We cannot
rule out the prospect of some beneficial effects. But if the
likelihood is small, there is an independent argument
against social and economic rights: If they will probably
not make things better, they are mere surplusage, and
constitutional surplusage is itself bad for nations that are
trying to create a culture of constitutionalism.</p>
        <p>It is true that some of these arguments depend on
somewhat speculative assumptions. Analysis ofwhat
belongs in a constitution is not like mathematics. Perhaps
the positive rights would have little adverse affect on
individual initiative; perhaps their existence would not
affectjudicial attitudes toward more readily enforceable
rights, like the right to free speech. In the end these are
empirical questions on which we have no hard evidence.
The ultimate question is how to proceed in the absence of
such evidence. Here the most we can do is to assess the
magnitude of therelevant risks. If what I have said is
correct, it seems hard to believe that positive rights would
actually help the lives of citizens in Eastern Europe, and it
seems very possible that such rights would undermine
the prospects for a form of constitutionalism that offers
firm protection to basic rights and that furnishes the
preconditions for the transition to a market economy.</p>
        <p>In these circumstances, what ought to be done? I
suggest three routes for the future. First, people now
drafting constitutions for Eastern Europe should delete or
minimize provisions that call for positive rights. At least, they
should eliminate those rights that fare worst under the
criteria I have set out here, and restrict such rights to
those that fare best (perhaps the right to social security).</p>
        <p>Second, those now drafting constitutions for Eastern
Europe might put the positive rights in a separate section,
as President Walesa's draft bill of rights has done in
Poland, making clear that such rights are not for judicial
enforcement, that they occupy a separate status, and that
they are intended to set out general aspirations for public
officials and for the citizenry at large.</p>
        <p>Third, judges and lawyers in Eastern Europe should
now be at work developing a jurisprudence that
minimizes the potential risks and maximizes the potential
benefits of positive rights. As a key part of this task, they
might adopt the notion that rights are
"nonjusticiable"not subject to judicial enforcement-when they call for
large-scale interference with the operation of free
markets, or when they call for managerial tasks not within
judicial competence. Any such notion must, however,
make it clear that courts will vigorously enforce the basic
political and civil rights whose violation was a daily affair
under Communist rule-rights such as free speech,
religious liberty, freedom from police abuse, due process,
and nondiscrimination on grounds of ethnicity, race,
religion, and sex.</p>
        <p>With constitutional rights, as with much else, less
may be more. A constitution that purports to guarantee a
decent society may, in the process, guarantee nothing at
all. This was a central problem with Communist
constitutionalism. It would be a cruel irony if the problem
were to be duplicated in the emerging democracies of
Eastern Europe.</p>

        <p>A THIR</p>
        <p>WAY?
By John Roemer andJonElster
The separation of powers is a central issue in
constitutional thought. The separation of executive and
legislative powers, discussed elsewhere in this issue, is a
prominent case. An independent judiciary is another. In a
broader sense, the independence of the central bank and
of the state-owned media can also be seen in this
perspective. The argument for separation of powers rests both
on positive and negative considerations. On the one hand,
the separation of powers isa form of division of labor that
enhances the efficiency of the political system. On the
other, it serves to prevent total usurpation of power by
any one state agency.</p>
        <p>One special problem with separation of powers-or
lack ofseparation-plagues anumber of political systems.
It may be briefly characterized as the need to separate the
instruments of economic policy from the tools of social
policy. In theory, and in the long run, both economy and
society will benefit if policies are oriented towards
economic efficiency, thus maximizing the revenues that can
be used to alleviate problems of unemployment and
poverty. In practice, because policy-makers are often
influenced by short-term considerations, there isa temptation
to make economic choices on the basis of their immediate
social consequences. To maintain employment,
governments all over the world support declining industries and
inefficient firms, blunting the edge of competition. The
bailout of Chrysler in United States and the subsidization
of the mining industry in Britain are two prominent
examples from the West. With regard to the planned
Communist economies, Janos Kornai coined the phrase "soft
budget constraint" to describe the position of managers
who know that banks or local governments have a strong
vested interest in keeping their firms afloat-and the
political clout to do so. The results in Eastern Europe, as we
know, were disastrous.</p>
        <p>To be more precise, the economic crisis of the
Communist countries was due largely to their failure to solve
variousprincipal-agenptroblems. A principal-agent problem
arises when one actor or group relies on another to carry
