      <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
      <p>Throughout its brief history, administrative law has often been
concerned with the question whether the name of its own subject is an
oxymoron. We might distinguish among three positions on that
question. The first treats law and administration as largely incompatible;
the second sees traditional legal checks as a bulwark against
administrative tyranny; the third suggests that these traditional checks must be
adapted to the values, functions, and failures of the administrative
state.</p>
      <p>The incompatibility of law and administration was a prominent
theme during the 1920s and the New Deal period, which produced a
fundamental reformation in the structure of American
constitutionalism.' Indeed, the creation of the administrative state was largely a
selfconscious repudiation of legalism. The New Deal reformers believed
that modern problems required institutions having flexibility,
expertise, managerial capacity, political accountability, and powers of
initiative far beyond those of the courts. On this view, the appropriate
response of the legal system to the rise of administration is one of
retreat.2</p>
      <p>The view that legal checks, in their traditional form, are an
indispensable constraint on regulatory administration played a large role in
the constitutional assault on the administrative state 3 and, in more
modest form, helped give rise to the Administrative Procedure Act
("APA") 4 in 1946. 5 This view can also be found in the old idea,
per1990]
haps enjoying a renaissance, that statutes in derogation of the common
law should be narrowly construed. 6 On this account, legal checks of
the pre-New Deal sort are a crucial mechanism for domesticating
regulation by limiting governmental interference with private markets and
by promoting a range of original constitutional goals. Hearing rights,
independent judicial interpretation of law, separation of functions, and
procedural safeguards are all necessary quid pro quos for the creation
of administrative agencies combining traditionally separated functions
and exercising broad discretionary authority.'</p>
      <p>A number of observers have argued that law should continue to
play a large role in the administrative state, but that it must be adapted
to take account of the new forms and values represented by the rise of
social and economic regulation.8 On this view, regulatory controls
protecting interests such as environmental quality, nondiscrimination, safe
work places, and fair trade practices should be treated hospitably by the
legal culture. This view can be found in a number of ideas: that private
law principles ought not to play a large role in administrative law; that
courts should attempt to prevent arbitrary or overzealous regulation,
but also to help bring about regulatory controls when they are legally
required; that courts should attempt both to promote the goals of
regulation, understood in a public-regarding way, and to ensure against its
pathologies. Here the relationship of law to administration is neither
acquiescence nor hostility but instead adaptation.</p>
      <p>All of these views have played a large role in legal developments of
the last two decades. In particular, the view that law and administration

Concept of Administrative Procedure, 78 Colum. L. Rev. 258, 268-74 (1978)
(discussing the Walter-Logan Bill, an earlier proposal to limit administrative agencies that laid
the foundation for the APA).</p>
      <p>Consider in this regard Roscoe Pound's claim that autonomous administration is a
"Marxian idea" or a system of "administrative absolutism," in Dodd, Garfield, Maguire,

are incompatible has enjoyed a revival-ironically, mostly at the hands
of people with little sympathy for regulation in general or the New Deal
reformation in particular.9 This view can be found in the revival of
serious limits on standing to review administrative action, on reviewability
of agency inaction, and on the courts' ability to impose procedural
requirements beyond those in the Administrative Procedure Act.' 0 But
of all of the Supreme Court's decisions raising issues of this sort, by far
the most important is Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense
      </p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>Council, Inc.' 1</title>
        <p>
          In Chevron, the Court established that "[i]f... Congress has not
directly addressed the precise question at issue," courts should accept
reasonable administrative interpretations of law. 12 The Chevron
principle means that in the face of ambiguity, agency interpretations will
prevail so long as they are "reasonable." This principle is quite jarring to
those who recall the suggestion, found in Marbury v. Madison 13 and
repeated time and again in American public law, that it is for judges, and
no one else, to "say what the law is."1 4 But it is also strikingly
reminiscent of the New Deal enthusiasm for agency autonomy and the New
Deal belief in a sharp disjunction between the realm of law and the
realm of administration. 15 In view of the breadth and importance of
the decision, it should be unsurprising that the case has been cited
9. See generallyJ. RabkinJudicial Compulsions (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">1989</xref>
          ) (arguing that courts should
limit intervention in agency process to protection of individual rights to liberty and
property, rather than considering policy arguments of various interest groups). An
exception isJ. Mashaw &amp; D. Harfst, The Struggle for Auto Safety (1990), which argues that
legal checks have slowed down desirable regulation; see also Strauss, Considering
Political Alternatives to "Hard Look" Review, 1989 Duke LJ. 538, 544 (arguing against
judicial "hard look" because of availability of political safeguards).
        </p>
        <p>It is not surprising that many commentators with little sympathy for regulation
recently have adopted the view that law and administration are incompatible. Since the
1980s, the Republican party, enthusiastic for deregulation, has occupied the executive
branch and thus dominated federal agencies. The majority in Congress generally has
been Democratic and more receptive to social and economic regulation. Part of the
debate over Chevron undoubtedly turns on competing views about regulation, and the
outcome of that debate will have consequences for the scope of regulatory intervention.
The reach of Chevron should depend, however, on broader institutional considerations,
not on political alliances, which may be short-term.</p>

more than 1000 times since its publication in 1984.16 Chevron promises
to be a pillar in administrative law for many years to come. It has
become a kind of Marbury, or counter-Marbury, for the administrative
state.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more importantly, the decision has established itself as
one of the very few defining cases in the last twenty years of American
public law. Chevron defines a cluster of ideas about who is entrusted
with interpreting ambiguous statutes and, less obviously, about what
legal interpretation actually is. t7 In its allocation of governmental
authority and in its production of outcomes in the real world, the
importance of the case far exceeds that of the Supreme Court's more
celebrated constitutional rulings on the subject of separation of powers
in the 1980s, probably even if all of these are taken together.1 8 In an
extraordinarily wide range of areas-including the environment, 19
welfare benefits, 20 labor relations, 2 ' civil rights, 2 2 energy, 2 3 food and
drugs,2 4 banking,2 5 and many others-Chevron has altered the
distribution of national powers among courts, Congress, and administrative
agencies.</p>
        <p>To say this is not to say that Chevron is self-applying. As is usual
with important rulings, the case raises at least as many questions as it
answers. The Court's reasoning has been subject to sharp criticism, 2 6
and it would not be altogether surprising to see departures from a
broad interpretation of Chevron. Indeed, the decision's own author,
Justice Stevens, has suggested a relatively narrow reading. 2 7 Perhaps
the principle of deference will apply only when the agency is carrying
out delegated lawmaking authority. 28 Perhaps the principle applies
only to cases calling for the agency's specialized fact-finding and
policymaking competence, most notably those involving applications of law
to fact, rather than pure questions of law.2 9 Perhaps an agency's views
about its own jurisdiction will have little or no weight, or perhaps, more
generally, an agency view will not warrant deference when its
self-interest is conspicuously at stake.3 0</p>
        <p>In this Article, I examine a range of questions about the rationale
and reach of Chevron. My most general goal is to give the decision its
appropriate place in mediating the relationship between law and
administration. To carry out that task, it will be necessary to explore
quite general questions about the relationship between the original
constitutional structure and modern regulatory government.</p>
        <p>
          The Article is organized into three parts. In Part I, I describe some
of the initial conflicts between law and administration and examine the
role of Chevron in reconciling these conflicts. In Part II, I explore
Chevron's reach, treating the case as if it set forth the only applicable
interpretive principle and discussing the limitations of that principle.
My principal claim here is that Chevron is best defended as a sensible
reconstruction of congressional instructions in light of the relevant
institutional capacities, and that this understanding requires certain
limitations on the Chevron principle as much as a general endorsement of
the principle itself. Most important, I argue that because Chevron
applies only in cases of congressional delegation of law-making authority,

agency interpretations in a number of contexts are not entitled to
deference at all.</p>
        <p>In Part III, I deal with a problem that has only begun to be
addressed in the courts. That question involves the relationship between
the Chevron principle and other prevailing norms or principles of
statutory construction.3 1 What is a court to do when an administrative
agency interprets an ambiguous statute in a way that conflicts with an
established interpretive principle?3 2 The question is of both
considerable theoretical interest and immense practical importance. If Chevron
allows agency interpretations to defeat well-established interpretive
principles, it will indeed have worked a revolution in the law.</p>
        <p>In Part III, I contend that many interpretive principles serve an
important separation of powers function by requiring legislative rather
than merely administrative deliberation on certain questions. For this
reason, the Chevron principle ought not to be understood to overcome
all otherwise applicable interpretive norms, though some of these
norms are in fact defeated by Chevron.</p>
        <p>
          A more general conclusion follows from these suggestions. In
many of its applications, Chevron is a salutary recognition of a
largescale shift in the allocation of authority within American institutions. It
embodies, in those applications, a plausible reconstruction of
congressional desires and a sound understanding of the comparative
advantages of agencies in administering complex statutes. At the same time,
Chevron is in tension with deeply engrained ideas, traceable to the
earliest days of the American republic, to the effect that those who are
limited by law ought not to be entrusted with the power to define the
limitation. But if other interpretive norms counter the Chevron
approach in contexts in which the risks are especially serious, it may be
possible to reconcile that approach with principles of separation of
powers and statutory construction that are both time-honored and
entitled to current respect. An effort to explain the relationship between
Chevron and other interpretive principles is therefore part of the
continuing and far larger enterprise of sorting out the relationship between
the original constitutional framework and traditional legal constraints
31. For a discussion of particular principles, see infra notes 160-174 and
accompanying text. For general discussion, see Eskridge, Public Values in Statutory
Interpretation, 137 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1007, 1019-33 (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">1989</xref>
          ); Sunstein, supra note 26, at 468-88.
Indeed, it is mistaken to suggest that language and history exist independent of
interpretive principles. The very notion of statutory text cannot make sense without
simultaneous reference to principles of statutory construction. See infra note 159.

on the one hand, and, on the other, a regulatory state that was intended
in large part to displace them.</p>
        <p>I. COURTS, ADMINISTRATION, AND THE NEW DEAL</p>
        <p>In this Part, I undertake two tasks. First, I outline the origins of the
perceived tension between law and administration, and I explore
various efforts by courts to mediate that tension in the wake of the New
Deal. Second, I discuss the origins and setting of the Chevron principle,
attempting to defend that principle by reference to certain
understandings about both the administrative state and the nature of statutory
interpretation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-2">
        <title>A. HistoricalNotes</title>
        <p>Before the rise of the regulatory state, the allocation of authority
between the executive branch and the judiciary was relatively clear: it
was for the courts, not the executive, to "say what the law is,"'3 3 at least
in litigated cases. This understanding extended to interpretation of
statutes no less than to interpretation of the Constitution.3 4 Most
statutory disputes did not involve the executive branch as a party. Since
government almost always acted without the mediation of a
policy-making, fact-finding administrative agency, it was only natural that
questions of statutory meaning would be decided by the courts. And when
the executive branch was a party, it was treated like any other litigant in
the sense that its own views would not be entitled to special weight. 35</p>
        <p>The judicial power of interpretation existed even when the task of
resolving ambiguities depended not only on statutory language and
history, but also on assessments of what sort of approach would produce
rationality or justice in federal law. When traditional sources of
interpretation left doubt, ambiguities were sometimes resolved by precisely
these assessments.3 6 To be sure, assessments of this sort called for
judicial inquiries into both policy and principle. But these inquiries were
not especially troublesome, forjudge-made regulatory
principles-embodied in the common law of torts, contracts, and property-had been
woven into the fabric of American public and private law from the
out1990]
set. Statutory interpretation that involved a measure of policy-making
discretion existed comfortably in a legal order in which policy
frequently had been determined by the judges.3 7</p>
        <p>All this was changed by the creation in the twentieth century of a
massive administrative apparatus, which was of course a self-conscious
repudiation of regulation through the judiciary. For the twentieth
century reformers, courts lacked the flexibility, powers of coordination,
initiative, democratic accountability, and expertise necessary to deal with
complex social problems.3 8 The administrative framework resulting
from these reform efforts disrupted every essential element of
American constitutionalism, including its three cornerstones: The original
conception of individual rights, the system of checks and balances, and
3 9
federalism.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most fundamental point is that the new framework
called into question the original understanding that individual rights
lay principally in immunity from governmental constraints.40 For the
New Dealers, individual rights were in fact a product of legal decisions;
they were hardly prepolitical or even "negative." Having rejected the
view that the common law system was part of the state of nature, the
New Deal reformers saw government action as a necessary guarantor of
economic productivity, distributive equity, and even rights, properly
37. Because basic policy often had been a creature of the common law, subject to
only intermittent statutory interference, it is misleading to suggest, as some do, see, e.g.,
J. Rabkin, supra note 9, at 6-18, that the period ofjudicial lawmaking is a creature of the
late twentieth century. Of course the use of the Constitution as a source ofjudge-made
law raises quite different questions from the use of the common law, especially because
the former is much more difficult to correct through the political process.</p>

understood. In these circumstances, the common law catalogue of
private rights was inadequate because it included both too much and too
little-too much in the way of protection of rights of property and
market ordering; too little because it excluded rights of economic security
deemed indispensable in the wake of the Depression.</p>
        <p>Institutional lessons followed from these substantive claims.
Traditionally separated powers and the system of checks and balances
seemed an obstacle to the enactment and implementation of
protections at the national level. New governmental bodies- combining
powers and not subject to the constraints of checks and
balanceswere necessary to carry out the agenda of the New Deal. Far from
being a valuable safeguard against national tyranny, federalism appeared
to be a faction-driven obstacle to necessary social change. So too,
traditional legal constraints on administration seemed to defeat the
goal of providing new entities with unique self-starting capacities, a
high degree of democratic accountability, and, not incidentally,
enthusiasm for the new regulatory missions set for the national government
by Congress and the President.</p>
        <p>It was inevitable that this set of claims-the continuing source of
most major debates in American public law-would ultimately draw
into question the idea that interpretation of regulatory statutes was for
the judiciary alone. Indeed, during the constitutional and
nonconstitutionaljudicial assault on administration, independent judicial
interpretation of law was seen as a constitutional requirement under article
111.41 Judicial review was thought to serve identifiable substantive goals
as well. Invoking the principle that statutes in derogation of the
common law should be narrowly construed, 42 and insisting that
interpretation of law was for judges, courts often sharply circumscribed
administrative power by drawing on principles of private autonomy and
free markets that regulation was intended to displace.43</p>
        <p>The idea that courts, and not administrators, were responsible for
discerning the meaning of statutes seemed to win legislative
endorsement through the enactment of the APA in 1946. 44 That statute was a
compromise between New Dealers enthusiastic about administrative
power and conservative critics who saw this power as a veil for tyranny,
particularly in the context of labor relations.4 5 Despite its ambivalence
on the question of agency autonomy, the APA appeared to endorse
judicial control of administration and to direct courts to interpret statutes
on their own. Thus the APA states: "To the extent necessary to
decision and when presented, the reviewing court shall decide all relevant
questions of law, [and]interpret constitutionaland statutoryprovisions .... ,,46</p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, in the aftermath of the constitutional assault on
administration, courts sometimes said that agencies were entitled to
interpret the statutes that they administer, and that courts would defer as
long as agency interpretations were reasonable. 4 7 This idea

        <p>46. 5 U.S.C. § 706 (1988) (emphasis added). Of course, it is possible that courts
sometimes should resolve the relevant question of law by holding that statutory
ambiguities are to be resolved by the agency. On that view, part of the answer to the legal
question is that ambiguities are for agency resolution. But when Congress has not
specifically conferred that power on the agency through the organic statute, that argument
seems weak.</p>
        <p>The legislative history emphasizes the need for judicial constraints on
administration. See, e.g., Legislative History, Administrative Procedure Act, S. Doc. No. 248, 79th
Cong., 2d Sess. 305 (1946) (remarks of Sen. McCarran, Chairman, House Judiciary
Comm.) ("I desire to emphasize the . . .provisions for judicial review, because it is
something in which the American public has been and is much concerned, harkening
back, if we may, to the Constitution of the United States, which sets up the judicial
branch of the Government for the redress of human wrongs"); id. at 217 (Report of the
Senate Judiciary Comm.) ("the enforcement of the bill, by the independent judicial
interpretation and application of its terms, is a function which is clearly conferred upon
the courts.... Judicial review is of utmost importance .... It is indispensable since its
mere existence generally precludes the arbitrary exercise of powers not granted"); id. at
251,311-12, 382-85.</p>
        <p>The influential Attorney General's Committee on Administrative Procedure was
uncertain on the point:</p>
        <p>The question of statutory interpretation might be approached by the court de
novo and given the answer which the court thinks to be the "right
interpretation." Or the court might approach it, somewhat as a question offact, to
ascertain, not the "right interpretation," but only whether the administrative
interpretation has substantial support .... Thus, where the statute is
reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation, the court may accept that of
the administrative body.... This may be particularly significant when the
legislation deals with complex matters calling for expert knowledge and judgment.
Final Report of the Attorney General's Comm. on Administrative Procedure, in
Administrative Procedure in Government Agencies, S. Doc. No. 8, 77th Cong., 1st Sess. 90-91
(1941). Note, however, that the Attorney General's Committee is entitled to far less
weight than the text of the APA and even its history in Congress, both of which argue for
independent review. Moreover, the Committee may well have been biased against
independent judicial review because it was allied with the institutional interests of the
executive branch, and because it consisted in large part of New Deal enthusiasts
skeptical about judicial checks on administration.</p>
        <p>The useful treatment in Scalia, Judicial Deference to Administrative Interpretations
of Law, 1989 Duke L.J. 511, 512-14, properly draws attention to this passage from the
Attorney General's Committee's report. But it overstates the extent to which deference
to administrative interpretations was contemplated by the APA as evidenced by its text
and underlying purposes, both of which argue in favor of independent review.</p>

Labor's definition of" 'area of production' " in Fair Labor Standards Act, noting that
Secsented a firm endorsement of the allied principles, prominent during
the New Deal, of administrative autonomy and limited judicial
interference with the process of regulation. It also recognized that the very
arguments that called for the rise of regulatory entities raised sharp
questions about whether judicial interpretation of regulatory law
should continue to be independent. Marbury, in short, no longer
seemed well adapted to American public law. At the same time, many
courts continued to insist that the interpretation of statutes was first
and foremost a judicial task.48</p>
        <p>It is ironic but true that this insistence became particularly
pronounced in the 1960s and 1970s, a period in which those enthusiastic
about regulation were especially dissatisfied with administrative
autonomy. In this period, agencies appeared unenthusiastic about their
mandates. The phenomenon of "capture" received widespread attention,
and judicial controls seemed to be an important part of the project of
ensuring that regulatory statutes, especially in the environmental area,
would produce change in the real world.49 In a surprising reversal of
New Deal alliances, those who were critical of the effects of regulation
in the 1980s were frequently insistent on administrative autonomy and
the perverse effects of legalism 5 0-whereas critics seeking to bring
about greater regulatory protections saw administrative independence
and autonomy as the problem rather than the solution.5 1 The rule of
law, including firm judicial constraints on the bureaucracy, was a
mechanism for ensuring that agencies would carry out the will of Congress.</p>

        <title>B. The Chevron Principle</title>
        <p>In Chevron, the Supreme Court confronted an important decision
by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") under the Clean Air
Act.52 The case involved permit programs in "nonattainment" states,
that is, states that have not met federal ambient air quality
requirements. These states are required to establish a permit program for
"new or modified major stationary sources" of air pollution.5 3 No new
or modified source may receive a permit unless it meets stringent
requirements. 54</p>
        <p>Before the 1980s, the EPA had treated as a "source" any
pollutionemitting device in a plant.5 5 If a plant had ten of these devices, it had
to apply for a permit to modify any of them or to add a new one. In
1981, however, the EPA decided that it would not require a permit if
the modification of an existing device or the installation of a new device
did not increase total emissions from the plant.56 In other words, the
plant, and not each emitting entity within it, would be treated as a
"source." This plantwide definition of source enabled a company to
add or modify pollution-emitting devices as long as it reduced
emissions from another part of the same plant, producing no aggregate
increase in emissions. The question for decision in Chevron was whether
the plantwide definition of "source" violated the Clean Air Act.57</p>
        <p>The court of appeals held that it did.58 For the lower court, the
purpose of the nonattainment program was to bring about rapid state
compliance with federal air quality requirements, and the plantwide
definition of source was inconsistent with that overriding goal. The
court was unable to point to a particular provision that barred the
EPA's plantwide definition, but it said that that definition was
inconsistent with the general purposes of the nonattainment program. 59</p>
        <p>
          The Supreme Court disagreed.6 0 Rebuking the court of appeals
for usurping the agency's policy-making authority, the Court said that
nothing in the statute or its history spoke to the issue whether the plant
or each emitting device within it amounted to a "source." The general
purposes of the nonattainment program, embodying an effort to
promote environmental quality with minimal restrictions on economic
growth, were simply too broad to bear on that issue. Because Congress
had not "directly spoken to the precise question at issue," the question

was "whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible
construction of the statute." 6 1 For the Court, "considerable weight should be
accorded to an executive department's construction of a statutory
scheme it is entrusted to administer."' 62 The Court thus created a
twostep inquiry. The first question was whether Congress had explicitly
foreclosed the agency's decision. The second was whether that
decision was reasonable or permissible.
        </p>
        <p>All this was sufficient to dispose of the specific problem in Chevron.
Congress had not decided against a plantwide definition of source.
Moreover, the agency's decision was an exceedingly reasonable means
of accommodating the economic and environmental goals that
underlay the Clean Air Act. Indeed, the plantwide definition achieved
economic savings without jeopardizing environmental degradation, and
may even have helped to diminish it.63</p>
        <p>In addition, a principle of deference was appropriate in Chevron.
The agency's fact-finding and policy-making competence, and its
electoral accountability, were highly relevant to the issue of how "source"
should be defined. In Chevron itself, the Court quite rightly implied that
any principle of deference is a product of Congress's explicit or implicit
instructions on that question. The central point is this: Courtsmust defer
to agency interpretationsif and when Congress has told them to do so. 64 And
when agency competence is relevant, deference is particularly
appropriate, since it is the most plausible instruction to attribute to Congress
if the legislature has issued no clear statement on the point-a subject
to which I return below. 6 5</p>
        <p>Since Chevron itself, the general principle of deference has been
invoked on numerous occasions and produced considerable
controversy. In INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca6, 6 the Supreme Court appeared to say
that Chevron would apply only in cases involving mixed questions of law
and fact, rather than pure questions of law: courts would decide pure
questions of law on their own. In a concurring opinion, Justice Scalia
vigorously rejected this suggestion, 67 and the Court has failed to take it

relevant cases, dominated by the Republican party, whereas the Congress is dominated
by Democrats. A principle ofjudicial deference to executive interpretations will, at least
in the short run, increase the power of the Republican branch-one that is far less
hosup in subsequent cases. In other cases the Supreme Court has held that
at least arguably ambiguous statutes admitted of only a single
interpretation, sometimes producing sharp dissenting opinions that invoked

      <p>It is not my purpose here to say whether or not the analysis in

ascertained, however, by considering what might be said in its favor.</p>
      <p>Before the discretionary, policy-making administrative agency
became pervasive, the notion that courts would interpret the law,
including federal statutes, seemed axiomatic. In the twentieth century,
however, Congress frequently has delegated basic implementing
authority to regulatory agencies, and the allocation of interpretive power
has become far more complex. Any principles of deference to
administrators must of course depend on congressional instructions, at least as
a general rule.</p>

propriate, the matter is relatively simple. 7 ' As stated above, the text
and background of the APA suggest a firm belief in the need for judicial
checks on administration, particularly with respect to the interpretation
of law. 7 2 The view that courts should always defer to agency
interpretations is, therefore, a poor reconstruction of the instructions of the APA.
It remains possible, however, that particular substantive statutes
displace the APA and accord law-interpreting power to the agency. If so,
the courts should defer in such cases on the ground that the relevant
law is what the agency says that it is. The APA's provision for
independent judicial interpretation of law is not inconsistent, then, with
Chevron's deference to the agency's interpretation if Congress has,
under particular statutes, granted the relevant authority to
administrative agencies.
      </p>
      <p>Frequently, however, Congress does not speak in explicit terms on
the question of deference. When this is so, the court's task is to make
the best reconstruction that it can of congressional instructions. 73 And
if Congress has not made a clear decision one way or the other, the
choice among the alternatives will call for an assessment of which
strategy is the most sensible one to attribute to Congress under the
circumstances. This assessment is not a mechanical exercise of uncovering an
actual legislative decision. It calls for a frankly value-laden judgment
about comparative competence, undertaken in light of the regulatory
structure and applicable constitutional considerations.</p>
      <p>If all this is so, the Chevron approach might well be defended on the
ground that the resolution of ambiguities in statutes is sometimes a
question of policy as much as it is one of law, narrowly understood, and
that agencies are uniquely well situated to make the relevant policy
decisions. In some cases, there is simply no answer to the interpretive
question if it is posed as an inquiry into some real or unitary instruction
of the legislature. Sometimes congressional views cannot plausibly be
aggregated in a way that reflects a clear resolution of regulatory
problems, many of them barely foreseen or indeed unforeseeable.7 4 In
these circumstances, legal competence, as narrowly understood, is
insufficient for decision. The resolution of the ambiguity calls for an
inquiry into something other than the instructions of the enacting
legislature. And in examining those other considerations, the
institution entrusted with the decision must make reference to considerations

of both fact and policy.75</p>
      <p>Chevron nicely illustrates the point. The decision about whether to
adopt a plantwide definition of "source" required distinctly
administrative competence because it called for a complex inquiry, not foreseen
by Congress, into the environmental and economic consequences of
the various possibilities. If regulatory decisions in the face of
ambiguities amount in large part to choices of policy, and if Congress has
delegated basic implementing authority to the agency, the Chevron approach
might reflect a belief, attributable to Congress in the absence of a clear
contrary legislative statement, in the comparative advantages of the
agency in making those choices.</p>
      <p>All this suggests that Chevron reflects not merely a particular view
about who ought to interpret ambiguous statutes, but also, and perhaps
more interestingly, a distinctive theory of interpretation. In the last
generation it has frequently been suggested that the process of
interpretation is often not merely a mechanical reconstruction of legislative
desires. 76 Instead that process sometimes calls for an inquiry into
questions of both policy and principle. Thus, for example, it has been
said that statutory ambiguities should or must be sorted out on the
basis of an assessment of which interpretation is "reasonable," 7 7 or makes
the statute "the best piece of statesmanship it can be, ' 7 8 or takes
account of appropriate background norms dealing with the functions and
failures of the regulatory state. 79</p>
      <p>At least as a general rule, these suggestions argue powerfully in
favor of administrative rather than judicial resolution of hard statutory
questions. The fact-finding capacity and electoral accountability of the
administrators are far greater than those of courts.8 0 Chevron is best
75. The question about whether deference is due to an administrative
interpretation of law itself is an example. Congress has not explicitly resolved that question, and
so it must be answered on the basis ofan attempted reconstruction invoking extratextual
considerations.</p>
      <p>76. See infra notes 77-79. In an important respect that process is never
mechanical, since it always depends on background norms. Even the easiest cases are decided by
reference to norms and practices that are in fact present, but are so widely shared as to
seem invisible. A denial that interpretive norms are at work should be taken as a
reflection of interpretive unself-consciousness. Usually, of course, the norms are supported
by a sufficiently broad consensus to make interpretation relatively simple-which, again,
is not to say mechanical.</p>

        <p>understood and defended as a frank recognition that sometimes
interpretation is not simply a matter of uncovering legislative will, but also
involves extratextual considerations of various kinds, including
judgments about how a statute is best or most sensibly implemented.
Chevron reflects a salutary understanding that these judgments of policy
and principle should be made by administrators rather than judges.8 1</p>
        <p>The point can be made more vivid by examining some of the
characteristic problems in modem regulation. 82 Often the regulatory
process is confounded by the difficulty of coordinating numerous statutes
with one another. For example, the problems of air and water
pollution are closely entangled. Efforts to control the one may aggravate
the other, and there are complex interactions among various cleanup
strategies. If the problems are treated separately, they will not be
treated well. The EPA is charged with implementing numerous
statutes, and it is in a far better position than the judiciary, reacting as it
must to single cases, to respond to difficulties of this sort.83</p>
        <p>Sometimes regulation is made more difficult because of the
pervasive problem of changed circumstances. New developments involving
technological capacity, economics, the international situation, or even
law may affect regulatory performance. Congress is unable to amend
every statute to account for these changes, a situation that creates a
genuine problem for those who must apply the statute. Here as well,
administrators are in a far better position than courts to interpret
ambiguous statutes in a way that takes account of new conditions8. 4 Or to
put the point slightly differently: Because of its focus on individual
cases, and because decisions are made after the dispute has arisen, the
common law process has a significant advantage over legislation in its
capacity to respond to changing conditions and mores. The shift from
the common law to legislation, embodied in the New Deal, therefore
gave rise to a serious risk of obsolescence, one that is often realized in
practice. 8 5 In these circumstances, a grant of interpretive authority to
(1982) (suggesting that NLRB's policies may be closely tied to those of the
administration). Moreover, shifts in the judiciary are a predictable consequence of shifts in the
administration, and in this sense courts are not wholly independent. Finally, agencies
are sometimes subject to narrow or parochial pressures. Their decisions can hardly be
said to track the public will in all cases. These qualifications do not, however,
undermine the basic claim that the democratic pedigree of the agency is usually superior to
that of the court.</p>

argues for judicial responses to this problem through "overruling" statutes, which in his</p>
        <p>HeinOnline -- 90 Colum. L. Rev. 2088 1990
administrators, allowing them to take changed circumstances into
consideration, seems to be a valuable if partial corrective.8 6 The result is
to confer a power of adaptation on institutions that combine the
judicial virtue of continuing attention to individual contexts and new
settings with the legislative virtue of a fair degree of electoral
accountability.</p>
        <p>Sometimes regulation fails because of the excessive rigidity of
statutory commands.8 7 In light of the wide variety of contexts to which
statutes must be applied, a degree of flexibility in implementation is
quite healthy. Congress cannot possibly foresee all of the problems to
be dealt with under broad statutory terms.8 8 Statutory terms may offer
ambiguous guidance to agencies that must establish regulations in
complex areas.8 9 Such agencies are in a much better position than courts to
approach are to be treated as precedents. See also G. Gilmore, The Ages of American
Law 95-98 (1977) (arguing forjudicial overruling of outdated statutes). But a system in
which administrators respond to changed conditions through statutory construction
seems far preferable. Administrators have a better democratic pedigree and more
knowledge with which to undertake this task. Moreover, changed circumstances often
produce ambiguities that agencies are in a uniquely good position to resolve. See
Sunstein, supra note 26, at 493-97.</p>
        <p>86. See infra notes 141-150 and accompanying text (arguing that deference is
appropriate when agency modifies or reverses prior interpretations); Scalia, supra note 46,
at 518-19 (same).</p>
        <p>87. A prominent example is the "best available technology" strategy in
environmental statutes, which requires all firms to adopt the same technology. A far better
strategy would allow for greater flexibility, allowing nontechnological means of reducing
pollution-when that approach is effective and cheap-and permitting diversity in
different parts of the country. See Ackerman &amp; Stewart, Reforming Environmental Law:

(1982) ("A busy and politically divided legislature has generally found it difficult to
enact specific standards or to engage in detailed supervision or review of specific
regulatory agency actions.").</p>
        <p>89. An example is provided by an important recent case in which a court relied on a
form of literalism to defeat a fully sensible administrative initiative. In American Mining
Congress v. EPA, 824 F.2d 1177, 1180 (D.C. Cir. 1987), the EPA issued regulations to
deal with the problem of disposal of material held for recycling. The EPA decided to
control, as solid wastes, "secondary materials" (spent materials, sludges, byproducts,
commercial chemical products, and scrap metals) unless these materials (a) are directly
reused as an ingredient or as an effective substitute for a commercial product, or (b) are
reused as a raw material substitute in the original manufacturing process. This
definition meant that material burned for energy recovery or that is reclaimed or accumulated
speculatively would be subject to government regulation as "solid waste."</p>
        <p>The court of appeals rejected the definition. According to the court, the statutory
definition of waste as "any garbage, refuse, sludge ... and other discarded material," 42
U.S.C. § 6903(27), meant that the secondary materials were not subject to EPA
regulation. 824 F.2d at 1179-85. According to the court, "discarded" means, simply,
discarded as that term is understood in the dictionary, and materials that would flow from
one production process to another were not "discarded." Id.</p>
        <p>The problems with this analysis are twofold. First, the statutory definition of waste
was not written with attention to the particular problems of materials held for recycling.</p>
        <p>HeinOnline -- 90 Colum. L. Rev. 2089 1990
that while "agency determinations within the scope of delegated
authority are entitled to deference," an agency" 'may not bootstrap itself
into an area in which it has no jurisdiction.' "127 The passage suggests
that jurisdictional determinations will not receive deference. But it is
somewhat ambiguous, and there is as yet no clear answer to this
question.</p>
        <p>Because congressional instructions are crucial here, courts should
probably refuse to defer to agency decisions with respect to issues of
jurisdiction-again, if we assume that the distinction between
jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional questions is easily administrable. The
principal reason is that Congress would be unlikely to want agencies to
have the authority to decide on the extent of their own powers. To
accord such power to agencies would be to allow them to be judges in
their own cause, in which they are of course susceptible to bias.</p>
        <p>Consider, for example, Dole v. United Steelworkers of America.128
There the issue was whether the Office of Management and Budget
("OMB") had the authority under the Paperwork Reduction Act of
1980129 to approve or disapprove agency rules requiring regulated
entities to disclose information directly to consumers, employees, or
others. OMB argued that the statutory words allowing it to review
rules regarding the "'obtaining or soliciting of facts by an agency
through ... reporting or recordkeeping requirements'" included
disclosure rules.13 0 The Court concluded otherwise, saying that the words
"by an agency" meant information gathered by the agency for its own
use rather than for disclosure to others.13 1 Because the Court found
the statute unambiguous in denying reviewing authority to OMB, it did
not have to explore the issue of deference. But it would have seemed
exceedingly odd to suggest that OMB should be allowed to resolve
ambiguities in a statute governing its own jurisdiction. The danger of bias
and self-dealing is so great as to make OMB an interested party.</p>
        <p>As Justice Scalia has emphasized, however, there would be some
difficulty in administering the sometimes elusive distinction between
jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional questions.13 2 In some cases in which
an agency is said to have exceeded its authority, or acted unlawfully, it
might also be said to have exceeded its jurisdiction.13 3 Moreover,
agency expertise and accountability are often relevant to the resolution
of a jurisdictional ambiguity. In the absence of a clear congressional
answer to the question, for example, the comparative competence of
the FCC might well bear on whether federal regulatory authority
extends to cable television.1 34 When Congress has not spoken clearly,
whether the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has adjudicative
authority over common law counterclaims might well depend on the
consequences of the exercise of that authority for the fair and efficient
administration of the Commodity Exchange Act. 135 For these reasons,
it would be at least plausible to suggest that a general rule of deference
would be preferable even on jurisdictional questions, because of its
greater ease of application and because the agency's competence bears
on the resolution ofjurisdictional ambiguities.</p>
        <p>Probably the best reconciliation of the competing considerations of
expertise, accountability, and partiality is to say that no deference will
be accorded to the agency when the issue is whether the agency's
authority extends to a broad area of regulation, or to a large category of
cases, except to the extent that the answer to that question calls for
determinations of fact and policy.1 3 6 On this approach, there is no
magic in the word "jurisdiction." Instead, the question is whether the
agency is seeking to extend its legal power to an entire category of
cases, rather than disposing of certain cases in a certain way or acting in
one or a few cases. This distinction it is not always extremely sharp,
and it will call for an exercise ofjudgment. But in the vast majority of
cases, it is easily administered.</p>
        <p>It should also follow that agencies will not receive deference when
they are denying their authority to deal with a large category of
cases.1 3 7 Here too the agency determination is jurisdictional. Here too
there is a risk of bias, in the form not of self-dealing, but instead of an
abdication of enforcement power. Because abdication has been a major
legislative fear,13 8 and because deference doctrine should not contain
an antiregulatory bias, Chevron should be inapplicable here as well. 13 9

provision stating that the EEOC had jurisdiction, and the complaint was timely filed,

5. Agency Bias. - We might generalize the discussion
ofjurisdictional determinations by supposing that the question at issue is one
with respect to which agency bias is peculiarly likely to be at work. The
agency might be deciding whether its own decisions are reviewable,
whether it has the power to issue fines, whether its authority extends to
new or unforeseen areas, or, perhaps more controversially, whether it
is compelled to undertake action that it prefers not to undertake-for
example, vigorous enforcement of federal environmental
controlsperhaps because of the pressures imposed by well-organized private
groups. In all of these cases, the likelihood of agency bias and
selfdealing might be serious. It would be peculiar, therefore, to defer to
the agency's views. This issue is one of particular importance,
especially in a period in which Congress is likely to be enacting regulatory
controls toward which the executive branch has expressed
ambivalence.140</p>
        <p>If Chevron applies only when the agency has been delegated
lawmaking authority, much of this problem will disappear. To be sure, an
agency's view that its own decisions are unreviewable, that it need not
undertake certain action, or that it has (or does not have) the power to
issue fines will amount to an "interpretation." But the expression of
these views is unlikely to be part of the exercise of authority that has
been congressionally granted. In these cases, an agency's claim of
immunity from the judiciary could not easily be seen as part of its
delegated rulemaking power. In rare cases, however, an agency might
interpret a statute in a way that predictably lines up with agency
selfinterest or bias even while exercising delegated authority. In these
cases, the rule of deference should probably be inapplicable, since
deference would be a poor reading of congressional instructions.</p>
        <p>Chevron's principle of deference, then, is an attempted
reconstruction of congressional instructions, one that is responsive to the
comparative advantages of the agency in administering complex statutes. It
follows that the principle is inapplicable when the best reconstruction
argues against deference. We have seen that when the agency has not
been accorded law-interpreting power, no deference is due.
Independent judicial assessments are also appropriate in other contexts
involving predictable bias, most notably jurisdictional determinations, but
also in other cases in which the agency's self-interest is conspicuously at
stake.</p>

      <sec id="sec-5-2">
        <title>6. Agency Views that Are New or that Depart from Past Practices.</title>
        <p>Before Chevron, agency decisions were entitled to deference if they were
longstanding, consistent, and contemporaneous; but new
interpreta140. The new Clean Air Act, Pub. L. No. 10 1-549, 104 Stat. 2399 (1990), is a
plausible candidate for this analysis. See, e.g., Benhan, Clean Air Bill Gets Harder Look
Amid Crisis, Investor's Daily, Aug. 29, 1990, at 1; Lobsenz, Administration Ups Clean
Air Cost Estimate, United Press Int'l, Aug. 2, 1990 (available on NEXIS).
tions were subject to more stringent judicial scrutiny.1 4 1 The reasons
for this distinction never have been entirely clear. Perhaps the special
deference accorded to longstanding interpretations embodied an effort
to import principles of stare decisis into administrative processes in
order to protect reliance and expectations. Perhaps the distinction was
part of an effort to constrain administrative wilfulness or the use of
"politics," perhaps understood as interest group power, to distort
statutory meaning. Perhaps this distinction was built on a belief that a
longstanding interpretation probably tracked congressional will, at the
stage of enactment and after, and was therefore correct as a matter of
statutory meaning. If these were the underlying ideas, an agency
decision that was novel or merely one of an inconsistent line of decisions
would not warrant deference. That decision would hardly protect
expectations and reliance, and it could not confidently be said to be a
correct understanding of what Congress wanted.</p>
        <p>On several occasions after Chevron the Court has reasserted
precisely this position. 14 2 But if Chevron is right, this position is wrong, or
at least it draws the distinction between longstanding and novel
interpretations too sharply.' 4 3 As we have seen, Chevron is best defended in
part as a means of counteracting problems of rigidity, obsolescence,
and changed circumstances in the regulatory process.' 4 4 The problem
of changed circumstances is a serious one for textual commands, which
are difficult to amend in light of competing demands on the legislators'
time. As a result, courts have sometimes taken account of changed
circumstances in order to render a novel interpretation, one that makes
sense of those commands or even remains faithful to them in light of
new developments. 145 But because of their fact-finding capacities,
electoral accountability, and continuing attention to changed
circumstances, agencies are far better situated than courts to soften statutory
rigidities or to adapt their terms to unanticipated conditions.14 6</p>
        <p>All this might suggest that an agency's new interpretations should
be entitled to the same basic deference as old ones. Agency decisions
about the meaning of ambiguous statutes often turn in part on
questions of policy. For an agency to interpret a statute one way rather than
another is for it to set out a view that is permissible rather than
mandatory. Under Chevron, agency views receive deference not because
they capture a unitary intended meaning, but because the resolution of
statutory ambiguities should be undertaken by accountable, specialized
administrators, not by courts. Under this approach, it matters relatively
little whether the agency decision is longstanding and consistent or not.
Regulatory shifts from one administration to another should be entirely
expected and indeed welcomed as a healthy part of democratic
selfgovernment or as a recognition of changed circumstances. So long as
the statute is ambiguous, those shifts reflect legitimate changes of
policy. One might expect, then, that after Chevron agency decisions will be
entitled to deference even if they are novel.</p>
        <p>The question is somewhat more complex, however, than the
discussion thus far suggests. As we have seen, a longstanding agency
interpretation might receive deference because of an interest in a form of
administrative stare decisis. If this is so, a new interpretation is entitled
to somewhat less deference than one that is longstanding. In a recent
case, the Supreme Court has recognized this point and, indeed, gone
somewhat further. In a partial qualification of Chevron, the Court held
in Maislin Industries, U.S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc. 147 that agencies may
not depart from an agency interpretation that the Court has upheld,
even in the face of changed circumstances.' 48 The case should
probably be read to say that an agency may not depart from an interpretation
that the Court has held to be statutorily mandated. It should not be
taken to say that a merely permissible interpretation is set in stone, or
that an agency may not take account of changed circumstances in giving
meaning to an ambiguous mandate, or a mandate that new
developments have rendered ambiguous. 4 9

text). This is not to say that Maislin was correctly decided. The case involved a decision
by the Interstate Commerce Commission ("ICC") to permit a shipper not to pay the rate
filed with it ("filed rate") when the shipper and the carrier had privately negotiated a
lower rate. According to the ICC, two changed circumstances required this shift. First,
carriers and shippers had frequently negotiated lower rates that were not filed with the</p>
        <p>HeinOnline -- 90 Colum. L. Rev. 2103 1990</p>
        <p>Two conclusions follow. First, and most importantly, agencies
should be allowed to depart from interpretations by prior
administrations, certainly in the face of changed conditions, but also to reflect new
views about policy. What is necessary is that the new interpretation be
explained as reasonable in light of statutorily permissible factors. 15 0
Second, new departures should be accorded somewhat less deference
than longstanding interpretations, for reasons analogous to those that
justify stare decisis in the judicial context.</p>

        <title>C. Chevron's Second Step: The Reasonableness of the Agency's Interpretation</title>
        <p>I have noted that Chevron sets out a two-step process for analyzing
agency interpretations. Even if Congress has not directly addressed the
issue in question, and even if deference is due, the agency's decision
must be "reasonable." 1'15 The Supreme Court has given little explicit
guidance for determining when interpretations will be found
reasonable. In most of the cases rejecting an agency's view, the Court has
relied on the first step of Chevron, finding an explicit congressional
decision on the point.</p>
        <p>ICC. In some of those cases, the carrier later filed for bankruptcy, and the trustee billed
the shipper for the difference between the tariff and the negotiated rate. The ICC
concluded that in these circumstances it would be unfair and irrational not to consider the
shipper's equitable defenses to a claim for undercharges. Second, the Motor Carrier Act
of 1980, significantly deregulating the motor carrier industry, justified the change in
policy, since under the new circumstances of competition strict application of the filed
rate was unnecessary to deter discrimination. See id. at 2762-64.</p>
        <p>In rejecting the ICC's position, the Court emphasized some of its early decisions,
e.g., Louisville &amp; N. Ry. v. Maxwell, 237 U.S. 94 (1915); Texas &amp; P. Ry. v. Mugg, 202
U.S. 242 (1906), creating a requirement of strict adherence to the filed rate
requirements and disallowing equitable defenses to collection of the filed tariff. See Maislin,
110 S. Ct. at 2766-67. But it is not clear that those decisions meant that the agency's
view was required rather than merely permitted, and in any case statutory changes had
converted a system of regulated monopoly into an extremely competitive market.
Nothing in the statute's text expressly prohibited the agency's shift in position. The central
statutory term is "reasonable," and the change in the nature of the industry made it
plausible for the agency to find reasonable what was once unreasonable. Indeed, the
agency's shift adapted legislative instructions sensibly to new conditions; little or
nothing could be said, as a matter of sound policy, against the agency's view. It is in these
circumstances that deference to the agency, rather than mechanical use of an ambiguous
statute, is especially appropriate. Cf. supra note 89, infra note 216 (discussing
mechanical definition of "solid waste"). But see Pittston Coal Group v. Sebben, 109 S. Ct. 414,
419-21 (1988) (literal interpretation used to forbid agency from reaching sensible result
not realistically inconsistent with statute); Public Citizen v. Young, 831 F.2d 1108, 1113

        <p>On the question of reasonableness, it seems clear that the agency
must be given considerable latitude. But this is not to say that the
agency may do whatever it wishes. The reasonableness inquiry should
probably be seen as similar to the inquiry into whether the agency's
decision is "arbitrary" or "capricious" within the meaning of the
APA. 15 2 That inquiry requires the agency to give a detailed
explanation of its decision by reference to factors that are relevant under the
governing statute.1 55 And while some decisions will be reversed or
remanded under this approach, 154 it is clear that within a wide range the
choice of policy is for the agency. 15 5</p>
        <p>III. INTERPRETIVE PRINCIPLES</p>
        <p>Thus far I have discussed the Chevron principle as if it stood
alone-that is, as if it provided the only applicable interpretive
principle, and was not in conflict with other possible principles. In fact,
however, the principle of deference is merely one of a large number of
interpretive principles or norms playing a major role in statutory
construction as that process occurs in courts, agencies, and elsewhere. In
some cases in which Chevron would otherwise govern, other interpretive
norms may require a rejection of the agency's position.</p>
        <p>In this Part, I discuss the relationship between Chevron and other
relevant principles. I conclude that Chevron is plainly overcome by
principles that help to ascertain congressional instructions. Norms calling
for an explicit legislative statement before certain results may be
reached also overcome the principle of deference; the reason is that
those norms are designed to ensure congressional deliberation on the
questions involved. The same is true for other norms designed to
counteract governmental bias or to protect legislative processes.
Norms against regulatory irrationality or absurdity, however, are
usually defeated by Chevron, since determinations of rationality are for
agencies rather than courts. 156</p>
        <sec id="sec-5-3-1">
          <title>A. In General</title>
          <p>Notwithstanding Karl Llewellyn's celebrated effort to demolish the
canons of construction by showing their tendency toward vacuity and
self-contradiction, 15 7 interpretive principles of various sorts continue
to be an important part of current law.' 58 Statutory ambiguity is
common. In the face of ambiguity, outcomes must turn on interpretive
principles of various sorts; there is simply no other way to decide hard
cases.1 59 Any volume of the Federal Reporter or the United States
Reports will turn up a wide range of interpretive principles. These
principles exist not only because they are indispensable to decision, but also
because many of them ieflect grammatical, institutional, or substantive
understandings that have or warrant widespread support.</p>
          <p>The point goes deeper still. Whether there is ambiguity-the
nominal trigger for deference under Chevron-is a function not
"simply" of text, but of text as it interacts with principles of interpretation,
some of them deeply engrained in the legal culture or even the culture
more generally. A major current task is to assign Chevron its place
within the universe of these principles. That task raises the question of
what constitutes "ambiguity" and of why and when "ambiguity" is a
sufficient reason for deference.</p>
          <p>For present purposes it will be useful to begin by distinguishing
among three sorts of interpretive principles. All of them are pervasive.
Syntactic principles help to discern statutory meaning in the particular
case. Courts sometimes rely on explicit and implicit interpretive
instructions from Congress about how statutes should be construed.
Substantive principles attempt to carry out policies, some of them with
constitutional status, that cannot be tied to any legislative judgment.</p>
          <p>Syntactic principles include a wide range of practices and ideas:
not merely the ordinary rules of language, but also the frequently
stated notions that a specific provision will trump a general provision
when there is a conflict;' 60 that when general words follow a particular
date agency decisions, since the agency is in a better position to judge whether a
particular rule is rational or not.</p>
          <p>157. See Llewellyn, Remarks on the Theory ofAppellate Decision and the Rules or
Canons About How Statutes Are To Be Construed, 3 Vand. L. Rev. 395 (1950).</p>
          <p>158. I will use the terms "canons," "norms," and "interpretive principles"
interchangeably in this discussion.</p>
          <p>159. In fact, interpretive principles are at work even in easy cases, or those
appearing to contain no ambiguity. Cases are easy only when and because the relevant
interpretive principles are not a matter of dispute. See Sunstein, supra note 26, at 464-65.
There are no easy cases without interpretive principles, which are necessary to give
context, and hence meaning, to language. To say that interpretive principles are not at
stake is actually to say that the relevant principles are supported by a consensus, so that
there is no dispute about their application or meaning.</p>
          <p>I deal here with interpretive principles that are conspicuous or contestable, in the
sense that they are self-consciously invoked as part of the process of resolving
ambiguities or cases otherwise in or close to equipoise.</p>

enumeration, they will be defined by reference to the particular
enumeration; 16 1 that every word in a statute will be given effect; 16 2 that
when Congress has specified the category of people entitled to a good,
there might be an inference that the people not expressly mentioned
are not so entitled. 16 3 Some of these principles are controversial, and
their application in particular cases will of course be a source of
dispute. But the use of syntactic principles, as a way of discerning
legislative instructions, is an ordinary part of statutory interpretation.</p>
          <p>Interpretive instructions include, least controversially, explicit
legislative guidance about statutory interpretation. The first provisions of
the United States Code provide a long list of these instructions, 164 and
other more particular statutes furnish similar guidance. 16 5 Some
principles of interpretation reflect implicit rather than explicit interpretive
instructions. Thus, for example, the idea that statutes will be construed
to be valid rather than invalid, 166 and the principle that appropriations
statutes will be narrowly construed,' 6 7 seem to be an accurate
reconstruction of likely legislative wishes. Congress would prefer validation
to invalidation, and its own rules and practices limit the consequences
of appropriations measures.</p>
          <p>Substantive principles are sometimes highly controversial, but they
play an extremely prominent role in statutory interpretation. Some of
these principles are designed to allocate authority among various
governmental entities. Some of them are more frankly designed to
produce particular outcomes. Many of these principles are constitutionally
inspired, as in the idea that federal statutes will not lightly be construed
so as to preempt state law; 168 that judicial review of agency action will
be presumed available;' 6 9 that statutes will be construed so as not to
interfere with the power of the President. 170 Some of these principles
serve other defensible substantive goals; these include the idea that
exemptions from the antitrust and tax laws will be narrowly construed,' 7 '
that statutes will be interpreted so as not to apply retroactively, 172 that
implied repeals will be disfavored, 173 and that federal statutes and
treaties will be construed generously to the Indian tribes. 17 4 The category
of substantive norms is not fixed but changes over time, with new
assessments of what norms are well adapted to the functions and failures
of government.</p>

        <sec id="sec-5-3-2">
          <title>B. Chevron and the InterpretivePrinciples</title>
          <p>What bearing does Chevron have on the principles of construction?
Notably, Chevron itself creates an interpretive principle, and if it is to be
defended, it must probably be as one that reflects implicit interpretive
instructions or that satisfies institutional goals.' 75 It is not difficult to
imagine a conflict between the Chevron principle and one or more of the
other interpretive principles. Imagine, for example, that an agency
interprets a statute in a manner that raises a serious constitutional
question, preempt state law, or unfavorably to the Indian tribes. The
problem has arisen specifically in cases in which agency interpretations
competed with the norms against retroactivity 76 and against implied
exemptions from antitrust laws. 177</p>
          <p>In these cases, the issue is whether Chevron will displace or be
displaced by otherwise applicable interpretive norms. That issue in turn
implicates a wide range of questions about the relationships among
different interpretive norms, created as they were in vastly different
periods and designed for dramatically different institutional arrangements
and substantive concerns. Here as well the traditional legal culture is
confronted by an administrative system built on a novel set of
substantive and institutional premises.</p>
          <p>
            In the discussion that follows, I propose to answer these questions
by disentangling the functions of interpretive norms and by examining
their relationship with Chevron. Not surprisingly, the answers require
an assessment of the interaction between the original constitutional
framework and governmental structures that self-consciously depart
from that framework. Each of the norms outlined here might fall in
more than one category, and the judgment about which category
applies will be contestable. The particular judgments are less important
than the general conclusion that norms that serve different functions
will interact with Chevron in different ways. I order the norms in

overcoming Chevron and ending with those that in all likelihood should be
defeated by agency interpretations.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-5-3-3">
          <title>C. Syntactic Norms and Interpretive Instructions</title>
          <p>It seems clear that agency interpretations will not prevail when
they conflict with syntactic norms. Chevron speaks of "the
unambiguously expressed intent of Congress" as the basis for rejecting an
agency's view, and many syntactic principles are explicitly designed to
help capture legislative instructions. The idea that specific terms
prevail over general, 178 that each word in a statute will be construed to
have independent meaning,' 79 and that words will be taken in the
context of the statute as a whole,' 80 are part of the process of uncovering
"legislative intent."1 8 1 These norms therefore overcome the agency's
view, at least if they operate reliably in the case at hand. The Supreme
Court has indicated as much in so many words.' 8 2</p>
          <p>The agency interpretation will also be defeated when Congress has
issued interpretive instructions. When explicit instructions appear in
the statutory text, they should prevail over contrary agency
interpretations. Interpretive instructions that do not appear on the face of the
statute, but that derive from the legislative history or background of the
statute, or from understandings about likely legislative desires, are also
part and parcel of the process of discerning Congress's instructions (its
"intent"). These instructions should also prevail over conflicting
agency views.</p>
          <p>The question is somewhat more difficult when the interpretive
instructions are implicit rather than explicit-as, for example, in the
notion that appropriations statutes will be narrowly construed, or that
statutes will be construed so as to be valid rather than invalid. 18 3 The
problem here is that implicit interpretive instructions are in a sense a
judicial rather than a legislative creation-a formulation of legislative
will that, while highly plausible, has been nowhere expressly stated, and
that may therefore be controversial. As the interpretive instructions
track legislative desires more controversially, they come closer to
falling into the category of substantive or institutional principles, which
provide a weaker case for rejection of Chevron. But when the principle
is closely traceable to a likely congressional judgment, it plainly defeats
the Chevron principle. The Court has so indicated in cases before and
after Chevron. 184</p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-5-4">
        <title>D. Norms that Require an Explicit Legislative Statement</title>
        <p>The discussion thus far has involved norms that are invoked to
uncover congressional "intent." The remaining categories of norms do
not involve legislative instructions or "intent" at all. It is plausible to
suggest that these norms should always be trumped by Chevron. In
Chevron, after all, the Court emphasized that the agency's view will
prevail unless there is a direct congressional judgment to the contrary.
When a court is dealing with norms that do not relate to congressional
instructions, it seems reasonable that the agency's view should prevail.
On this account, only intent and intent-related canons can defeat the
agency's view. 18 5</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Chevron does refer to and endorse the
"traditional tools of statutory construction." 18 6 This point has frequently
been emphasized in subsequent cases. 18 7 Constitutionally inspired
norms, along with many others that serve institutional or substantive
goals, stand as part of those traditional tools. If the traditional tools
include the substantive norms, then these norms can defeat agency
interpretations consistently with Chevron. In many cases, powerful
arguments support this conclusion.</p>
        <p>It will be useful to begin with norms designed to require that
statutes contain an explicit statement from Congress. "Clear statement"
principles are omnipresent in current law. A subset of the category of
interpretive norms, they are designed to ensure an unambiguous
state1990]
ment from Congress before allowing certain results to be reached. One
of their targets is governmental outcomes that reflect views that can be
traced only to the executive branch, and not to the national legislature
as well. Principles that require a clear legislative statement, I argue,
overcome Chevron.</p>
        <p>1. Constitutionally Inspired Norms. - Many substantive norms have
constitutional foundations. Examples include the principle that
statutes ordinarily will be construed to be valid rather than invalid, to steer
clear of serious constitutional doubts, so as not to intrude on the
traditional power of the President or preempt state law. 188 Principles of this
sort require a clear statement from Congress before courts will
interpret statutes as intruding into constitutionally troublesome areas.</p>
        <p>If these principles cannot be understood as a way of discerning
legislative instructions, and if Congress can displace them with a clear
statement, how might they be defended? The process of statutory
construction is often thought to be a means of discerning the meaning of
statutory words, and here substantive principles might be considered
irrelevant or indeed illegitimate. By using these principles, courts
decide cases of statutory meaning by reference to something external to
legislative desires, even though the interpretation in question would
not ordinarily violate the Constitution.</p>
        <p>There are, however, at least three reasons for the continued use of
constitutionally inspired interpretive principles. First, it is sometimes
impossible to decide hard cases without resorting to these principles.
Some cases are genuinely in equipoise, and courts (or agencies) need
tie breakers. It is hard to object to tie breakers that are rooted in
constitutionally grounded structural principles.</p>
        <p>Second, some principles are justified as an effort to ensure
legislative rather than merely administrative deliberation about
constitutionally troublesome issues. 18 9 This idea is itself based on considerations
of constitutional structure. For example, the Supreme Court no longer
enforces the nondelegation doctrine with much vigor, and probably for
good reasons.1 90 But in the wake of the downfall of that doctrine, the
use of constitutionally based clear statement principles serves as a
nar188. See supra notes 168-170 and accompanying text.</p>
        <p>189. The point is explicitly recognized, in rejecting the Chevron principle in favor of
the principle of state autonomy, in California State Bd. of Optometry v. FTC, 910 F.2d
976, 981-82 (D.C. Cir. 1990).</p>
        <p>
          190. That "Congress cannot delegate legislative power to the President is a
principle universally recognized as vital to the integrity and maintenance of the system of
government ordained by the Constitution." Field v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649, 692 (1892).
The Court has not struck down a statute on nondelegation grounds since the New Deal.
For a justification of its unwillingness to do so, see Stewart, Beyond Delegation
Doctrine, 36 Am. U.L. Rev. 323, 328-29 (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref89">1987</xref>
          ). For some opposing views, see Industrial
Union Dep't v. American Petroleum Inst., 448 U.S. 607, 673-75, 685-87 (1980)
(Rehnquist, J., concurring), and sources cited id. at 687 n.6; J. Ely, Democracy and
Distrust 131-34 (1980).
rower and more targeted means of ensuring that Congress, rather than
bureaucrats, will deliberate on questions that raise serious
constitutional difficulties or intrude into constitutionally sensitive areas.
        </p>
        <p>In this respect, clear statement principles operate like the
nondelegation doctrine. Both have roots in article I, and these principles can
be understood as a second-best surrogate for that doctrine-a
surrogate that is responsive to the intrusiveness and unwieldiness of a
largescale judicial revival of the nondelegation doctrine. In Kent v. Du~les,19 1
for example, the Supreme Court held that a seemingly open-ended
grant of authority to the President to issue and deny passports did not
include the power to refuse to allow Communists to leave the country
because of their political commitments. 19 2 The decision should be
understood as an effort to ensure that the national legislature, not simply
the executive branch, has deliberated on a question raising difficult
constitutional questions relating to freedom of expression and the right
to travel. This approach therefore responds to the delegation problem
that would result from a decision to allow the executive branch to
undertake constitutionally troublesome acts pursuant to an open-ended
delegation of authority.</p>
        <p>Third, clear statement principles help to promote fidelity to
constitutional norms that, while having a solid constitutional pedigree, are
judicially underenforced. 19 3 Because judicial invalidation of statutes is
troublesome in a constitutional democracy, courts are properly
reluctant to enforce the Constitution with the vigor that might be
appropriate for institutions having a better electoral pedigree. Since the Court
"underenforces" the Constitution, certain constitutional norms in fact
reach beyond the place where courts have vindicated those norms. It
follows that an aggressive judicial role in statutory interpretation, one
that removes statutes from the terrain of constitutional doubt, will
promote greater conformity with norms that in fact do have constitutional
status.</p>
        <p>When constitutionally based norms conflict with an agency's
interpretation, it is highly probable that the agency's view will not prevail.
As we have seen, the Supreme Court has held that a statute apparently
conferring broad power to forbid Americans from leaving the country
would not be interpreted to allow the Secretary of State to deny
passports to American citizens who were members of the Communist
191. 357 U.S. 116 (1958).
192. See id. at 129-30.</p>
        <p>
          193. See generally Sager, Fair Measure: The Legal Status of Underenforced
Constitutional Norms, 91 Harv. L. Rev. 1212, 1213-28 (1978) (arguing that courts are
constrained by their institutional role from fully enforcing constitutional norms). The point
is reflected in the fact that the Supreme Court often interprets constitutional provisions
with reference to its own limited fact-finding and policy-making competence. See, e.g.,
Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 194-95 (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">1986</xref>

Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 442-43 (

party. 19 4 According to the Court, a general grant of authority to the
executive branch should not allow the Secretary of State to intrude on
what might be a constitutionally protected right to travel. If Congress
intends to authorize this result, it must express its will clearly.' 9 5
Indeed, in a large number of cases, many of them postdating Chevron, the
Court has invoked constitutionally inspired principles in order to reject
agency interpretations of law.' 9 6 The most conspicuous of these
principles is the idea that ambiguous statutes will be construed so as not to
raise serious constitutional questions.
        </p>
        <p>It is thus implausible that, after Chevron, agency interpretations of
ambiguous statutes will prevail even if the consequence of those
interpretations is to produce invalidity or to raise serious constitutional
doubts. The very reason for the interpretive principle in favor of
avoiding invalidity or serious doubts is to ensure explicit
congressionalauthorization before certain results may be reached. As the Court held in
unambiguous terms in DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp;
ConstructionTrades Council,197 a statute should not be interpreted to
confer that authority simply on the agency's say-so.</p>
        <p>Other constitutionally inspired principles will produce a similar
tension with Chevron. For example, the idea that judicial review of
ad194. See Kent, 357 U.S. at 130; supra notes 191-192 and accompanying text.
195. In Kent and related cases, the link between the clear statement principle and
the nondelegation doctrine is especially conspicuous: courts demand a clear statement
from the principal lawmaker and do not regard a vague or general grant of authority as
genuine democratic authorization for constitutionally troublesome decisions.</p>
        <p>196. See DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council,
108 S. Ct. 1392, 1397 (1988) (construing NLRA narrowly to avoid potential first
amendment problem); Industrial Union Dep't v. American Petroleum Inst., 448 U.S. 607,
645-46 (1980) (construing OSHA narrowly so as to avoid unconstitutional delegation);
NLRB v. Catholic Bishop, 440 U.S. 490, 507 (1979) (construing NLRA narrowly so as to
avoid violation of free exercise clause).</p>
        <p>But see Massachusetts v. Secretary of HHS, 899 F.2d 53, 59-64 (1st Cir. 1990) (en
banc); Planned Parenthood Fed'n ofAm. v. Sullivan, 913 F.2d 1492, 1497-98 (10th Cir.
1990); New York v. Sullivan, 889 F.2d 401, 407-10 (2d Cir. 1989), cert. granted sub
nom. Rust v. Sullivan, 110 S. Ct. 2559 (1990), in which lower courts have held that the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has the statutory authority to deny
funds for clinics that counsel pregnant women about abortion but that do not actually
perform abortions. Under the relevant statute, HHS must deny funds to clinics in which
"abortion is [used as] a method of family planning." 42 U.S.C. § 300a-6 (1988). There
is a substantial question about whether those cases were rightly decided. (The issue is
currently before the Supreme Court in Rust.) Serious constitutional questions would be
raised by a congressional effort to prevent clinics from speaking to patients about the
abortion alternative, and the text of the statute is ambiguous. In the absence of a clear
legislative statement, it should probably be interpreted so as to avoid the constitutional
question.</p>
        <p>197. 108 S. Ct. 1392 (1988). The Court noted that it normally would defer to the
agency, but "[a]nother rule of statutory construction [is] pertinent here: where an
otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional
problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such
construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress." Id. at 1397.
ministrative action will be presumed available 9 8 and the principle that
federal statutes will not lightly be taken to preempt state law1 99 might
well conflict with agency interpretations.</p>
        <p>In these cases too, the Chevron principle will probably be held
inapplicable.20 0 These norms are in significant part an effort to promote
congressional-rather than executive or bureaucratic- deliberation on
certain issues, and to cabin executive officials by calling for express
legislative authorization. If constitutionally inspired interpretive norms
are understood in this way, they cannot be trumped by Chevron. The
comparative advantages of the agencies are not at stake when a
constitutional norm that argues in favor of legislative deliberation is involved;
indeed, the institutional considerations counsel against acceptance of
the agency's view.</p>

        <title>2. Nonconstitutional Norms Designed to Require a Clear Congressional</title>
        <p>Statement. - A number of norms without constitutional status are also
designed to ensure a clear congressional statement before certain
results might be reached. By limiting administrative discretion to make
law, these interpretive principles also act as surrogates for, or
particularized versions of, the nondelegation doctrine. This is so even though
the principles cannot be linked cleanly to a constitutional provision.</p>
        <p>Principles of this sort have been used throughout the history of
American law. They require the legislature to express itself clearly if it
wants to depart from ordinary understandings about the scope and
nature of regulatory policy. Though these understandings are at best
indirectly rooted in the Constitution, they draw considerable weight from
history, usual practice, and time-honored notions of equity and comity.
They require general legislative authorization for new departures.</p>
        <p>Examples include the principle that appropriations statutes do not
amend substantive statutes, 201 the presumption against retroactivity, 2 02
and the idea that laws will apply only within the territory of the United

statement from Congress, they probably cannot be defeated by the
agency's contrary view.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the argument for this result is weaker than in the case
of constitutionally inspired norms, and perhaps some nonconstitutional
norms can be defeated by an agency interpretation. But if the norm is
an effort to require a clear legislative statement, it should usually
prevail. For example, the idea that statutes generally will apply only within
the territory of the United States is an attempt to conform to the
reasonable expectations of both the legislature and affected persons. It
also performs an important function in sorting out the relations
between domestic law and that of other nations. An administrative
agency should not be permitted to displace a principle designed to
ensure that if American law is to apply outside of American borders,
Congress must say so explicitly. Quite similar ideas account for the
presumption against retroactivity-a straightforward effort to promote
reasonable expectations-and the notion that appropriations
measures, usually assembled quickly and without much deliberation, will not
be taken to amend substantive statutes. Since these norms are
intended to require legislative deliberation, Chevron should not overcome
them.</p>

          <title>E. Norms Designed to CounteractAdministrative or Governmental Bias</title>
          <p>
            Some interpretive norms are intended to respond to systemic
biases in governmental processes and thus to promote principles of fair
dealing. These norms are not designed merely to require a clear
statement from Congress; they represent a quite general effort to resolve
ambiguities in a way that fairly allocates both burdens and benefits in
governmental processes. The idea that treaties and statutes should be
construed generously to the Indian tribes is a prominent example. 20 4
This principle is designed to require a clear congressional statement
before allowing a statute to be interpreted unfavorably to a group that
has been mistreated in the past. Similarly, criminal statutes are
interpreted favorably to criminal defendants 20 5 and to require mens rea.206
The same idea accounts for the notion that it is not for agencies to

          <p>It would be odd to suggest that these principles can be overcome
by an agency interpretation. Principles of this sort are self-conscious
efforts to counteract administrative or governmental bias, by requiring
an express congressional judgment on the point before allowing certain
results to be reached. These principles should not be overridden
simply because the agency wants them to be.</p>

        <title>F. Norms Designed to Protect Legislative Processes</title>
        <p>Some norms are designed to protect the legislative process by
increasing rationality and integrity in that process. In this category
belong the ideas that implied repeals are disfavored; that exemptions
from taxation or antitrust will be narrowly construed; and that
appropriations statutes will rarely be understood to amend substantive
statutes. 208</p>
        <p>There is a legitimate argument that Chevron overcomes norms of
this sort. Through these norms, courts attempt to coordinate statutes
with one another and to promote the coherence of statutory law. The
agency is in a superior position to perform that task. Its expertise and
experience with related statutes make it better able to fit statutes with
one another or to coordinate seemingly inconsistent enactments. 209
Norms designed to promote the coherence of statutory law probably
should counteract the agency's view if, but only if, the purpose of the
relevant norm is to ensure a clear congressional statement or to carry
out likely interpretive instructions from the legislature. If the norm
merely reflects the court's own view about how statutes ought to be fit
together, Chevron should require the agency's position to prevail. This
conclusion is consistent with the Chevron Court's recognition that in the
aftermath of the rise of the administrative state, the role of
coordinating and making sense of regulatory enactments falls principally on
agencies rather than judges.</p>

overview of the system as a whole. Moreover, the Clean Air Act relates to the Clean
Water Act, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251-1387 (1988), in important ways, with regulation of the

position to take account of these effects.

that are designed to counteract absurd or unjust results. The judgment
about what approach is absurd or unjust is likely to be made by
reference to traditional legal understandings. At least in general, a contrary
administrative judgment ought to be respected. Indeed, a decision by
the court to apply its own judgment in this context would, in effect,
substitute a judicial for an administrative determination in
circumstances in which Congress has delegated policy-making power to the
agency.</p>
        <p>An example of the central idea here is the time-honored view that
general language ought not lightly be taken to require irrational or
absurd consequences. 2 10 General language is quite frequently
overinclusive-in the sense that it has unforeseen but perverse
applicationsand courts usually will not interpret the statutory text to apply if it
would produce absurdity that was not clearly intended by Congress.
More particular versions of this idea, with some support in the cases,
are that de minimis exceptions will be permitted 21 1 and that the costs
and benefits of regulation will usually be subject to some sort of
weighing process. 2 12</p>
        <p>In these areas, displacement of ordinary interpretive norms by the
agency's view is highly plausible. The agency's specialized fact-finding
capacity and policy-making competence are highly likely to be relevant
in resolving any ambiguities. Here the court ought to be especially
cautious in attributing irrationality or absurdity to the agency's view. It is
the agency that is most likely to be in a good position to know whether
the application, taken in context of the statutory scheme as a whole, is
in fact irrational or absurd.</p>
        <p>
          It follows that, while courts have held that de minimis exceptions
to regulatory statutes are usually permitted, agencies should be
permitted to decide that de minimis exceptions should not be allowed,
because (for example) of the high costs of inquiry into whether a
particular exception is or is not de minimis. 21 3 Whether or not this is a
persuasive argument, the agency is in a better position than the courts
to decide. The salutary interpretive principle in favor of de minimis

exceptions, therefore, ought not to defeat an agency construction to
the contrary.
        </p>
        <p>For another example, there may be a question of whether courts
are authorized to require a showing of "irreparable injury" and to
conduct the ordinary form of balancing before issuing an injunction. The
question is of considerable importance to environmental policy. One
answer to this question can be found in the Supreme Court's
interpretive principle in favor of equitable balancing. 2 14 Whether or not this
principle is justified, it should be defeasible upon a showing that the
agency disagrees. The Court's choice of a background rule here is not
realistically attributable to Congress; it represents instead a contestable
judgment about how the statute is best implemented. On that score,
the agency's contrary judgment should prevail.</p>
        <p>In many other cases, the meaning of a statute turns at least in part
on the rationality of one or another interpretation. 2 15 When this is so,
deference is due to the agency's view, unless it is inconsistent with an
interpretive norm having another source, or unless the absurdity or
irrationality is so palpable as to be something on which reasonable
people could not differ. Significantly, it would follow that an agency should
be permitted to depart from the literal meaning of the statute in cases
involving issues that Congress has not specifically considered,
especially when such departures plausibly make sense of the statute in light
of Congress's general purposes. 21 6</p>
        <p>
          This idea has potentially broad consequences. In the period of
common law ordering, courts often departed from the literal meaning
of statutes in cases in which literalism produced absurdity or
irrationality. In the modem period, similar departures should also be expected,
but here the principal agent is the agency rather than the judiciary.

on the literal meaning of the word "discarded" to forbid the EPA from applying solid
waste regulations to materials held for recycling. It is implausible to think that Congress
considered the exceptionally complex issues of policy in American Mining Congress. In
light of the complexities, deference was due to an agency that had thought long and
hard about the problem. See supra note 149.
pated or changed circumstances, has fallen principally to nonjudicial
actors.</p>
        <p>CONCLUSION</p>
        <p>Many disputes in contemporary public law involve the relationship
between original constitutional principles and a twentieth century
governmental apparatus that was created in self-conscious rejection of
those principles. Chevron, a kind of counter-Marbu y for the
administrative state, is one of many efforts at synthesis. Despite its seemingly
technical character, the Chevron principle-in far more substantial ways
than more visible decisions of the 1980s-has altered the fabric of
modern public law, influencing an enormous range of substantive
outcomes in the process.</p>
        <p>In these circumstances, the controversy over the principle is hardly
surprising. Chevron has been defended as a plausible reconstruction of
legislative instructions, one that amounts to a desirable device for
allowing the will of democratically controlled, specialized agencies to
prevail over that of unaccountable, generalist judges. In particular, the
principle might serve as a means of counteracting characteristic
problems in the regulatory process-including, above all, the problems
posed by lack of coordination, changed circumstances, statutory
rigidity, and complex systemic effects. For the resolution of these problems,
agencies have significant advantages over courts. On the other hand,
Chevron has been criticized as an inaccurate reading of congressional
instructions and as a departure from the principle, central to the system
of checks and balances, that those limited by law ought not to be
allowed to decide on the meaning of the limitation.</p>
        <p>Both the defenses and the criticisms have force in particular
contexts. The effort to mediate between them calls for an attempt to sort
out the relationship between the New Deal reformation and the
principles of institutional authority that preceded it. More narrowly, it calls
for an assessment of likely congressional instructions, often undertaken
in the absence of clear legislative guidance and therefore based on an
understanding of relevant institutional capacities and biases. I have
suggested that the Chevron principle does not apply unless Congress
has given law-interpreting power to the agency. This basic principle,
calls for deference to an agency's determination when the agency has
been granted the basic authority to implement the statute through
rulemaking or adjudication. It argues against deference most
powerfully when there has been no grant of implementing power at all,
but also when an agency has been granted but has not exercised
implementing power, when it is deciding on its own jurisdiction, or when it is
otherwise likely to have a bias.</p>
        <p>Whether or not a narrow formulation of the Chevron principle is
desirable, it is possible to find a place for the competing considerations
by exploring ,the relationship between that principle and other norms
of statutory interpretation. Indeed, it is precisely here that the legal
system will resolve many of the struggles over the roles of Congress,
agency, and court in the development of federal regulatory law.</p>
        <p>When the relevant interpretive norm is part of an effort to discern
legislative instructions, Chevron is uncontroversially subordinate to that
norm. Harder questions arise in cases involving norms that serve
substantive or institutional goals not directly connected to a congressional
judgment. When these norms are traceable to constitutional
considerations, or to other efforts to ensure a clear congressional statement
before government may go forward on a particular matter, the Chevron
principle should be overcome. And when the norm is an effort to
counteract some form of bias, Chevron should be inapplicable. The
Chevron principle should prevail, however, when the relevant norm
reflects an effort to promote rationality in regulation and when it is
intended to ensure coherence and integrity in the administrative process.
Here deference to the agency is especially important.</p>
        <p>The meaning of a statute can usually be discerned without the
benefit of interpretive principles of the sort that I have discussed here.2 17
But cases of ambiguity are frequent, and it is in these cases that Chevron
and other interpretive principles are called into play. By developing a
clear view of the relationship among those principles, we might
ultimately be able to reconcile Chevron, even in its broader formulations,
with approaches to statutory interpretation that help to discipline the
administrative state through legal constraints on the exercise of public
power. A reconciliation of this sort would count as one among a wide
range of steps designed to adapt a legal system founded on common
law principles to the aspirations and pathologies of the administrative
state.</p>
