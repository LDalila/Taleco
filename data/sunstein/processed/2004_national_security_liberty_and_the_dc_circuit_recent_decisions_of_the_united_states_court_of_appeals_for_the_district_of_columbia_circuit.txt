D.C.  Circuit

Introduction

When  the  country  faces  a  genuine  threat,  how  should  judges  approach
conflicts  between  national  security  and  freedom?  In  the  aftermath  of  Sep-
tember 11,  this question  has become one  of the most pressing in all  of Ameri-
can  law.

It  is  easy  to  imagine  two  extreme  positions  that  federal  courts  might
adopt:  National  Security  Fundamentalism  and  Liberty  Perfectionism.'  Na-
tional  Security  Fundamentalists  understand  the  Constitution  to  call  for  a
highly  deferential  role  for  the  judiciary,  above  all  on  the  ground  that  when
national  security  is  threatened,  the  president  must  be  permitted  to  do  what
needs  to  be  done to  protect the country.  For National  Security Fundamental-
ists,  courts  should adopt a  strong  presumption  in  favor  of allowing  the  presi-
dent  to  do  as  he  wishes.  If  the  president  cannot  safeguard  the  nation's
security,  who  will?  By  contrast,  Liberty  Perfectionists  insist  that  in  times  of
war,  at least  as  much  as  in times of peace,  federal judges must protect  consti-
tutional  liberty.2  Indeed,  Liberty  Perfectionists  believe  that  under  circum-
stances  of  war  it  is  all  the  more  important  that  federal  judges  take  a  strong
stand  on  behalf  of  liberty.3  Liberty  Perfectionists  emphasize  that  when  na-
tional  security  is  at risk,  unjustified  public  panics  are  likely,  even  inevitable.
If federal  judges  do  not protect  liberty  in  the  face  of panic,  who  will?

We  can  also imagine  a  third approach:  minimalism. 4  Minimalists  believe
that,  in  the  most  controversial  areas,  judges  should  refuse  to  endorse  any
large-scale  approach  and  should  be  reluctant  to  adopt  wide  rulings  that will

stein,  Minimalism at  War, 2004  Sup.  CT.  REV.  47;  there  is  significant  overlap  between  the  two
essays.  My  focus  here,  however,  is  on  the  particular  practices  of the  D.C.  Circuit  and  other
lower  federal  courts,  whereas  my  focus  there  is  on  the  general  practice  of  minimalism.

National  Security  Fundamentalism  is  an  extreme  version  of what  Posner  and  Vermeule  call  the
accommodationist  view;  Liberty  Perfectionism  is akin  to what  they  deem  the strict  enforcement
view.  See Posner  & Vermeule, supra, at  605-10.  Their  target is  the  civil  libertarian  concern  that
accommodationist  rulings  will  weaken  liberty  during peacetime  and that during emergencies  the
government  will  respond  to  unjustified  public  panic.  See  id.

Instead,  minimalists  want
bind  the  country  in  unforeseen  circumstances. 
judges  to  rule  narrowly  and  cautiously.  In  the  context  of  war,  minimalists
would  like  courts  to  avoid  constitutional  issues  by, for  example,  holding that
Congress has  not authorized  the  executive  to  intrude into  the domain of con-
stitutionally  protected  interests.  Minimalists  also  like  to avoid  broad judicial
pronouncements  about  either  presidential  power  or  liberty,  preferring  in-
stead  close  consideration  of  particular  measures.  In  the  aftermath  of  Sep-
tember  11,  minimalists  want  courts  to  proceed  in  small  steps,  leaving  the
largest  issues  undecided  as  long  as  possible.

This  Essay  has  three  goals.  The  first  is  to  sketch  the  rise  of  National
Security  Fundamentalism  in various places,  above  all the  United States Court
of Appeals  for the  District of Columbia  Circuit.  Notably,  the  Supreme  Court
has  not  yet  embraced  National  Security  Fundamentalism;  on  the  contrary,
the  Court  appears  to  have repudiated  it.5  But National  Security  Fundamen-
talism  has played  a  prominent role in the  Department  of Justice,  in a remark-
able  opinion  by  Justice  Clarence  Thomas,  and  in  a  number  of  lower-court
decisions.  If the risk of terrorism  increases,  and if the  nation  is hit with  addi-
tional serious  terrorist  attacks,  the  temptation  to  embrace  National  Security
Fundamentalism  might  well  prove  overwhelming.

My  second  goal  is  to provide  a  brief outline  of the  tension  between  Na-
tional  Security  Fundamentalism  and  the  Constitution.  I  suggest  that the  lat-
ter provides  no room for  the former  and  that a number  of loose statements  in
the  recent  past are  based  on a  mistaken  understanding  of the founding  docu-
ment.  My  third  and  final  goal  is  to  understand  the  appeal  of  a  constitution-
ally  mischievous  approach  to  liberty  amidst  war.  I  suggest  that  National
Security  Fundamentalism  is especially  tempting for lower  courts consisting  of
judges  appointed  by  a  Republican  president and  asked  to  assess  actions, by  a
Republican  president,  that  are  designed  to  protect national  security.  When
national  security  is  threatened,  Republican  appointees  are  exceedingly  likely
to  defer  to  Republican  presidents.  This  is  especially  so  on  the  lower  courts,
which  are  likely  to  be most  reluctant  to  invalidate  acts  of the  commander  in
chief  of  the  armed  forces.  Some  of  the  more  disturbing  rhetoric  in  recent
decisions  by  the  D.C.  Circuit,  and  by  trial  courts  within  that  circuit,  is  best
understood  in  this  light.

I.  National Security Fundamentalism

It should  be  unsurprising  to  find  that, in  the  aftermath of  the  attacks  of
September  11,  National  Security  Fundamentalism  has  obtained  a  great  deal
of  support.  As  I  have  noted,  the Supreme  Court  has  refused  to  accept  it,  at
least  thus  far. 6  But  the  basic  approach  can  be  found  in  many  places,  most
prominently  in  Washington,  D.C.

National Security,  Liberty, and the D.C. Circuit

A.  Justice Clarence Thomas in  Hamdi

In  recent  Supreme  Court  decisions  involving  the  war  on  terrorism,  Na-
tional  Security  Fundamentalism  failed  to  attract  a  majority  opinion.7  But  it
made  a  conspicuous  appearance  in  a  remarkable  dissenting  opinion  by  Jus-
tice  Clarence  Thomas  in  Hamdi v.  Rumsfeld.8  In  Justice  Thomas's  view,  the
Constitution  accords  to  the  president  the  "primary  responsibility  ... 
to  pro-
tect  the  national  security  and  to  conduct  the  Nation's  foreign  relations."9
And  Justice  Thomas  emphasized,  very  broadly,  that  any constitutional  judg-
ment  in  this  domain  should  consider  "basic  principles  of  the  constitutional
structure  as  it  relates  to  national  security  and  foreign  affairs."10  Hence, judi-
cial  judgments  should  be  made  against  the  backdrop  set  by  the  president's
inherent  and  broadly  discretionary  power  to  protect  national  security."

With  respect to  the  courts,  Justice  Thomas  contended  that  "it  is  crucial
to recognize  that judicial interference  in  these  domains  destroys  the  purpose
of vesting  primary  responsibility  in  a  unitary  Executive."'1 2  Judges  "lack  the
relevant  information  and  expertise  to  second-guess  determinations  made  by
the  President. ' 13  In  fact,  congressional  grants  of power  should  be  construed
generously  on  the  president's  behalf,  rather  than  narrowly,  so  as  to  fit  with
institutional  limits  on  the  power  of  the  judiciary.1 4  Because  the  executive
branch  of  the  federal  government  has  an  "overriding  interest  in  protecting
the  Nation,"  it can  invoke that  interest  to justify depriving people of liberty.1 5
In  fact,  Justice  Thomas  argued  in  favor  of  broad  constructions  of  congres-
sional  grants  of  authority  partly  to  avoid  constitutional  difficulties:  "Al-
though  the  President  very  well  may  have  inherent  authority  to  detain  those
arrayed  against  our  troops, I  agree  with  the  plurality that we  need  not  decide
that  question  because  Congress  has  authorized  the  President  to  do  so."16

Justice Thomas's  opinion is  a  form of National  Security Fundamentalism
because  of its  breadth  and  ambition.  There  is  no  effort  here  to  offer  a  cau-
tious ruling  tailored  to  the  facts  of the  particular case.  On  the contrary,  Jus-
tice  Thomas  speaks  generally  about  the  "primary  responsibility"  of  the
president  in  the  domain  of  "national  security. ' 17  In  addition,  he  adopts  a
kind  of  interpretive  principle  in  favor  of  presidential  authority-suggesting,
at least  implicitly,  that  statutes should  be read  in a  way  that does  not conflict
with  the president's  inherent  authority.' 8  But from  a reading  of the Constitu-
tion  alone, it  would  not  be  entirely  clear  whether  the  president  or  the  Con-

president's  authority).

gress  has  primary  responsibility  in the  domain  of national  security-an  issue
to  which  I  will  return.  The  important  point  is  that  Justice  Thomas  offers  a
distinctive  vision  of  the  constitutional  structure,  one  that  accords  principal
authority  to  the  president  and  a  small  or  even  nearly  nonexistent  role  for
courts,  and  thus  exemplifies  National  Security  Fundamentalism.

B.  The  Department of Justice

In  recent  years,  the  most  visible  moment  for  National  Security  Funda-
mentalism  came  from  the  Office  of Legal  Counsel  of the Department  of Jus-
tice,  with  its  2002  memorandum  on  the  legality  of  coerced  interrogation.1 9
The  most  remarkable  aspect  of the  memorandum  is  its  suggestion  that,  as
commander  in chief  of the  armed  forces,  the  president  of  the  United  States
has  the  inherent  authority  to  torture  suspected  terrorists  so  as  to  make  it
constitutionally  unacceptable  for  Congress  to  ban  the  practice  of  torture.20
The  Office  of Legal  Counsel emphasized  that  "the President  enjoys  complete
discretion  in  the  exercise  of  his  Commander-in-Chief  authority  and  in  con-
ducting  operations  against  hostile  forces. '21  In  addition,  the  Office  of  Legal
Counsel  insisted  that  a  core  function  of  the  commander  in  chief includes  in-
terrogation  of  the  enemy. 22  Because  of  "the  President's  inherent  constitu-
tional  authority  to  manage  a  military  campaign  against  al  Qaeda  and  its
allies,"  congressional  enactments  "must  be  construed  as  not applying  to"  in-
terrogations  undertaken  as  part  of  the  president's  commander-in-chief  au-
thority.23  "Any  effort by  Congress  to regulate  the  interrogation  of battlefield
combatants  would  violate  the  Constitution's  sole  vesting of the  Commander-
in-Chief authority  in the  President. '24  Hence, coercive  interrogation,  includ-
ing  torture,  must  be  permitted  if  the  president  wants  to  engage  in  it.

Constitutional  interpretation  is,  of course, very  much a  function  of insti-
tutional role.  Those  who  work  for  the  House  of Representatives  or  the  Sen-
ate might  well  be  expected  to  aggrandize  the  powers  of Congress;  those  who

19  See  Memorandum  from the  Office  of Legal  Counsel,  United  States  Department  of Jus-
tice,  to  Alberto  R.  Gonzales,  Counsel  to the  President  (Aug.  1, 2002)  [hereinafter  OLC Memo-
randum]  (regarding  "Standards  of Conduct  for  Interrogation  under  18  U.S.C.  §§  2340-2340A"),
available  at  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/documents/dojinterrogationmemo
20020801.pdf.  This  was  the  most  visible  moment  for  National  Security  Fundamentalism,  but
perhaps  not the  most  extreme  one.  In Rumsfeld  v.  Padilla, the  president  claimed  that, as  com-
mander  in  chief,  he  had  the  inherent  power  to  order  military  authorities  to seize  an  American
citizen in the  United  States without  any judicial  approval  and to hold him  indefinitely,  incommu-
nicado,  with  no  access  to  a  lawyer,  a  court, family,  or  friends,  and without  even  informing  his
family  or friends  what  they  had done  with  him.  See Brief  for  the  Petitioner  at  35-38,  Rumsfeld
v. Padilla,  124  S.  Ct.  2711  (2004)  (No.  03-1027). 

I discuss  Padilla below.

23  Id. at 34.  To be  sure,  the position of  the Department of Justice  was stated with  a  degree
of tentativeness.  It announced  that  it  "will  not read"  the  congressional  ban  on torture as  apply-
ing  in the  context  of battlefield  interrogations.  Id. at  34.  So  phrased,  the suggestion  is a form  of
minimalism,  asking  for  avoidance  of the  constitutional  issue by  reading  the statute  so as  not  to
intrude  on  the  president's  authority  as commander  in chief.  See id.  But the  general  impression
is  that  the  ban  probably  should  be  regarded  as  unconstitutional.

National Security, Liberty, and the D.C. Circuit

work for  the  Department  of State  might  well  be  expected  to  exaggerate  the
authority  of the  president.  The  Office  of Legal  Counsel  is part of the  execu-
tive  branch,  operating  directly  under  the  attorney general,  and  one  of its ma-
jor  functions  is  to  protect  the  constitutional  prerogatives  of  the  president,
especially  those prerogatives  that are  associated  with  the commander-in-chief
power.  Generous  interpretations  of  the  president's  prerogatives  should  be
expected  from  any  office  within  the  Department  of Justice,  above  all  when
national  security  is  at risk.  But  in its endorsement  of presidential  power,  the
memorandum  on  coerced  interrogation  went  well  beyond  ordinary  practice.
To  be  sure,  the president  has inherent  authority  to  oversee  battlefield  opera-
tions, and  Congress  has  limited  power to  control such  operations.  The  presi-
dent  also  has  the  inherent  authority  to  conduct  interrogations  amidst  war.
But, to  say the  least, it  is unusual  to say  that this  authority includes  the  power
to torture  people  when  Congress has  expressly  said otherwise.  The  power  to
command  the  armed  forces is not easily  taken to include  "inherent"  power to
torture  enemy  combatants.  Even  if  it  does  include  that power,  it  is  hard  to
contend  that  Congress  cannot  provide  protection  against  torture.25

Whatever  one's  ultimate  judgment  on  the  merits,  the  memorandum  of
the  Office  of Legal  Counsel  provides  a  dramatic example  of National  Secur-
ity Fundamentalism.

C.  National Security Fundamentalism and the D.C. Circuit  The President

and  "the  War Power"

In  the  years  since  the  September  11  attacks,  National  Security  Funda-
mentalism  has  played  a  large  role  on  the  lower  federal  courts.26  A  single
circuit  has  decided  most  of  the  key  cases  involving  a  conflict  between  na-
tional  security  and  individual  liberty:  the  United States  Court of Appeals  for
the  District  of  Columbia  Circuit.  That  court  has  shown  a  remarkable  ten-
dency  toward  National  Security  Fundamentalism.  In  every  case  in  which  a
serious  challenge  was  mounted  to the  power  of the  president,  the  president
has  prevailed  in  the D.C.  Circuit.  Let  us  investigate  a  few  examples.

One  of  the  most  striking  decisions  from  the  D.C.  Circuit  is  Center for
National Security  Studies  v.  Department of Justice.27  In  that  case,  a  divided
court  of  appeals permitted  an  extraordinary  level of  secrecy  from  the  execu-
tive  branch.  Its reasoning  is  far  more  important  than  its  (plausible)  conclu-

25  See  Youngstown  Sheet  & Tube  Co.  v.  Sawyer,  343  U.S.  579,  644  (1952)  (Jackson,  J.,
concurring).  Note  that  in  some  applications,  the  commander-in-chief  power  is  more  plausibly
read  to include the  power to torture-when, for  example,  torture is  deemed necessary  to  prevent
an  imminent  attack  on  American  troops.  But even  here,  Congress  almost certainly  has  the  au-
thority  to  forbid  the  practice  of  torture.

26  The  principal  exception  is  Padilla v.  Rumsfeld,  352  F.3d  695  (2d  Cir.  2003),  rev'd on
other grounds, 124  S.  Ct.  2711  (2004),  in which  the  United  States  Court  of Appeals  for  the  Sec-
ond  Circuit  held  that the  president  could  not detain  Padilla  because  he  lacked  the  inherent  au-
thority to do so  and because  Congress  had not authorized  the  detention of American  citizens  on
American  soil.  See id. at  712-18,  722-23.  This  is  an  example  of minimalism  in  action,  as  dis-
cussed  in  Part  IV  infra.

sion,  simply  because  of  its  broad  pronouncements  about  presidential
authority.

A number  of public interest groups  invoked the  Freedom  of Information
Act  ("FOIA"),2 8 the  common  law,  and  the  First  Amendment  to  require  the
government  to release  information  about those who  had been detained  in the
aftermath  of  the  September  11  attacks. 29  The  requested  information  in-
cluded  names,  dates  of  arrest and  release,  and  reasons  for  detention. 30  The
disclosure  request  had  a  strong democratic  justification:  evaluation  of the ex-
ecutive's  behavior  could not easily come from a  public  not provided with  this
information.  In  ruling that  disclosure  was not  required,  the court  relied  on a
broad  interpretation  of exemption  7(A)  of FOIA, which  exempts  "records  or
information  compiled for law enforcement  purposes..,  to  the extent that  the
production  ...  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  interfere  with  enforcement
proceedings."

31

As  Judge  Tatel  emphasized  in  dissent,  the  court's  interpretation  of  this
exemption  was  contestable;  the  court could  easily  have gone  the  other way. 32
What  is  most important  is  that the  court  was  exceptionally  deferential  to  the
government's  vague  statements  about  potential  harms.33  The  court was  en-
tirely  aware  of  this  point.  In  language  that  is  closely  linked  to  Justice
Thomas's  dissenting  opinion  in  Hamdi, the  court  emphasized:

[T]he judiciary owes  some  measure  of deference  to  the  executive  in
cases  implicating  national  security,  a  uniquely  executive  pur-
view ....  We  have  consistently  reiterated  the principle  of deference
to  the  executive  in  the  FOIA  context  when  national  security  con-
[W]e  have  consistently  deferred  to execu-
cerns  are implicated.... 
tive  affidavits  predicting  harm  to  the  national  security,  and  have
found  it  unwise  to undertake  searching  judicial  review.34
Indeed,  the court  went  so  far  as  to  comment  specifically  on  the  distinc-
tive  nature  and  legal  relevance  of  the  current  threat  to  national  security:
"America  faces  an  enemy just as  real as  its former  Cold  War foes, with  capa-
bilities  beyond  the  capacity  of  the judiciary  to  explore. '35  In  fact,  the court
insisted  that  deference  was  "mandated  by  the  separation  of powers, '36  sug-
gesting  that  disclosure  under FOIA  would raise constitutional problems.  The
court  left  no  doubt  about  the  motivation  for  its  action:  "[W]e  are  in  accord
with  several  federal  courts  that  have  wisely  respected  the  executive's  judg-
ment  in  prosecuting  the  national  response  to  terrorism." 37  What  is  most
noteworthy  about  the  decision,  then,  is  not  the  outcome,  but  the  court's
broad pronouncements  about the need  to  defer  to the  executive  and  its inter-

Another  strikingly  fundamentalist  decision  by  the  D.C.  Circuit  is  Al
Odah v.  United States, which  the Supreme  Court reversed  in Rasul v.  Bush.38
In  its  ambitious  ruling,  the  D.C.  Circuit  held  that  aliens  captured  outside  of
the  United  States have  no rights  under  the  Due  Process  Clause.39  The  court
said  that  the  Guantinamo  Bay  detainees  were,  in law,  analogous  to German
prisoners  captured  on  the  battlefield  during  World  War  11.40  The  court  ac-
knowledged  that  Guantdnamo  Bay  is  controlled  by  the  United  States  mili-
tary,  but  it  insisted  on  the  irrelevance  of  this  fact  because  Cuba  has
sovereignty  over  the area.41  The  court's  conclusion  was hardly unreasonable.
But there can  be no doubt  that the  conclusion in favor of executive  discretion
stemmed  from  a  broad  and  hardly  mandatory  reading  of  Supreme  Court
precedents.

A concurring  opinion  by Judge  Randolph  (who  wrote  the  majority  opin-
ion  as  well)  was,  in  a  sense, even  more  revealing.  Judge  Randolph  went  well
beyond  what was  necessary  to  resolve  the  case.  Consider  his confessedly  ag-
gressive  opening  sentence:  "I  write  separately  to  add  two  other  grounds  for
rejecting  the  detainees'  non-habeas  claims. '4 3  The  fundamental  motivation
for his  separate  opinion  seemed  to  be  captured  by  his final  sentence:

The  level  of threat  a  detainee  poses  to  United  States  interests,  the
amount of intelligence  a  detainee  might  be able to  provide,  the con-
ditions  under  which  the  detainee  may  be  willing  to  cooperate,  the
disruption  visits  from  family  members  and  lawyers  might  cause-
these  types  of judgments  have  traditionally  been  left  to  the  exclu-
sive  discretion  of  the  Executive  Branch,  and  there  they  should
remain. 4

Here  is  an  explicit  endorsement  of  National  Security  Fundamentalism.

Within  the  D.C.  Circuit,  the  trial  courts  have  followed  the  lead  of  the
court  of  appeals,  showing  a  similar  tendency  toward  National  Security  Fun-
damentalism.  Consider,  for  example,  ACLU  v. Department of Justice,45  in
which  organizations  sought  information  involving  the  government's  use  of
section  215  of  the  USA  PATRIOT  Act.46  Section  215  gives  the  FBI  broad
power  to  "make  an  application  for  an  order  requiring  the  production  of any
tangible  things..,  for an  investigation  to obtain foreign  intelligence  informa-

tion  ... or  to  protect  against  international  terrorism. '47  In  particular,  the
plaintiffs sought  to  use  FOIA to  find  out (1) the  total  number  of section  215
requests  received  by  the National  Security  Law  Unit  of the  FBI  and  (2)  any
and  all  records  relating  to  section  215.48 Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the
Department  of  Justice  had  previously  made  several  disclosures  of its  behav-
ior under  the  USA  PATRIOT  Act,  the  court  ruled  broadly  that  the  national
security  exemption of FOIA justified  the  failure to  disclose  the information. 49
The  court  knew  that  it  was  dealing  with  a  hard  question,  candidly  ac-
knowledging  that  the "issue  is  hardly  free from  doubt. ' 50  But it  ruled  for the
government  "because  it  [was]  mindful  of  the  'long-recognized  deference  to
the  executive  on  national  security  issues."' 51  Ultimately  the  court  deferred,
not  to  specific  explanations  by  the  executive,  but  to  the  exceedingly  vague
claims  that  release  of  the  number  of  section  215  field  requests  "poses  the
continuing  potential  to  harm  our national  security  by  enabling  our  adversa-
ries  to  conduct  their intelligence  or international  terrorist  activities  more  se-
curely. ' 52   The  court's  willingness 
to  embrace  National  Security
Fundamentalism  is  best  understood  in  light  of  a  background  principle  in
favor  of executive  power  in  the  domain  of national  security.

A similar  approach can  be found  in  Edmonds v.  Department of Justice.53
There  the  court gave  an exceedingly  broad  reading  to  the  "state secrets privi-
lege"  so  as  to  dismiss  a  Privacy  Act 54  claim  brought  by  a  self-styled
whistleblower  at  the  FBI.55  One  of  the  most  striking  parts  of  the  court's
opinion  came  in  a  footnote,  in  which  it  addressed  the  possibility  of  staying
the  case  rather  than  dismissing  it:  "This  is  due  not  only  to  the  nature  of  the
information,  but  also  because  the  imminent  threat  of  terrorism  will  not  be
eliminated  anytime  in  the  foreseeable  future,  but  is  an  endeavor  that  will
consume  our nation's  attention  indefinitely. '56  Under  FOIA, then,  National
Security  Fundamentalism  has  been  explicitly  endorsed  within  the  D.C.  Cir-
cuit,  in  holdings  that  fit  well with  the  general  approach  in Al  Odah.

field,  could  be  detained  indefinitely  and  without  trial,  even  if  they  were
American  citizens. 59  In  so ruling,  the  court  relied  largely  on a constitutional
source-the  president's  power  as  commander  in  chief  of  the  armed  forces. 60
The  court  contended  that  this  power  includes  "the  authority  to detain  those
captured  in  armed  struggle"  and  also  "to  deport  or detain  alien enemies  dur-
ing  the  duration of hostilities  and  to  confiscate  or destroy  enemy property. 61
The  central  question  in  the  case  involved  the  procedural  protection,  if
any,  that  would  accompany  the  exercise  of  the  commander-in-chief  power.
The  court emphasized  the need to  defer to  the  president:  "The  Constitution's
allocation  of the warmaking  powers reflects not  only  the  expertise  and expe-
rience  lodged  within  the  executive,  but also the  more  fundamental  truth that
those  branches  most  accountable  to  the  people  should be  the  ones  to  under-
take  the  ultimate  protection  and  to  ask  the  ultimate  sacrifice  from them. 62
Hence,  deference  to  the  executive  would  be  the  basic  rule. 63  The  court was
aware  that, in denying  fair procedure,  the president  was doing  something  un-
usual, but changed circumstances  justified  this step:  "As  the  nature  of threats
to  America  evolves,  along  with  the  means  of carrying  those  threats  out,  the
nature  of enemy  combatants  may  change  also.  In  the  face  of such  change,
separation  of powers  doctrine  does not  deny the  executive  branch  the essen-
tial  tool  of adaptability. '" 64

Indeed,  the  court said  that the  source  of the  detention was  not a  statute,
but  "Article  II,  Section 2,  of the  Constitution,  wherein  the  President  is given
the  war  power. ' 65  (I  will  return to  this  important  statement,  which  seems  to
lie behind  the  D.C. Circuit  opinions as well,  in  due course.)  Deference  to the
president  stems  from  this  explicit  grant  of authority.  So  long  as  a  detention
it  must  be
"is  one  legitimately  made  pursuant 
respected. 66  A general  statement on the  part  of the  executive  supporting  the
claim  that  a  citizen  was  detained  in  the  course  of  war  and  qualified  as  an
enemy  combatant  would  be  sufficient. 67  The  court  left  no  doubt  that  this
conclusion stemmed  from  National  Security  Fundamentalism:  "The  constitu-
tional  allocation  of  war  powers  affords  the  President  extraordinarily  broad
authority  as  Commander  in Chief and  compels courts  to assume  a deferential
posture."68

That deference  required  the  conclusion  that Hamdi could  be  held  indefi-
nitely, even  after  the  end of the  relevant  hostilities. 69  In reaching  this conclu-
sion,  the  court  referred  to  the  judgments  of  the  executive  branch  without
even pausing  to  consider what  kind  of authorization  Congress  had  given  it.70
Because  the  D.C.  Circuit  and the  Fourth  Circuit  have been  the  most impor-
tant sources  of lower-court  decisions  involving  liberty  and the  war  on terror-
ism,  it  is  fair  to  say  that National  Security  Fundamentalism  has  played  the
dominant  role  on  the  federal  courts  in  the  aftermath  of  the  September  11
attacks.

II.  National Security Fundamentalism and the  Constitution

Why  have  lower  courts  been  drawn  to  National  Security  Fundamental-
ism?  In  the  abstract,  National  Security  Fundamentalism  has  a  great  deal  of
appeal.  Far more  than  Congress,  the president  is  in  a  position  to act  quickly
and  decisively to  protect  the citizenry.  He is  also likely  to  be  able to  acquire
relevant  information  about  what must  be done  and  about when  to do it.  Be-
cause  the  president is  commander  in chief of the  armed  forces,  Congress  can-
not  override  the  president's  judgments  about  how to  carry  out a  lawful  war.
Justice  Thomas correctly  emphasizes  that Alexander  Hamilton  defended  the
creation  of a  "unitary  executive"  as  a  means  of  ensuring  energy,  coordina-
tion, and  dispatch  in  the  presidency.71  These  qualities  are  relevant  above  all
in  times  of war.  By  contrast,  courts  lack  good  tools  for  assessing  the presi-
dent's  claims  of military  necessity.

At  least  equally  important, judicial  errors  may turn  out  to  be  disastrous
rather  than  merely  harmful.  To  be  sure,  American  practice  suggests  that
judges are  most  unlikely  to  err  by protecting  civil  liberties; 72 in  our history,  it
is  hard  to  find  even  a  single  case  in  which  judicial  protection  of  freedom
seriously  damaged  national  security.  But  if  Liberty  Perfectionism  were  ac-
cepted, some  such errors  would  become  far more probable.  In ordinary  con-
texts,  even  those  that  involve  criminal  justice,  the  stakes  are  not  nearly  so
high.  There  is  every  reason  for courts  to  avoid  a  decision  that  leads  to  free-
dom  for terrorists  or to  disclosure  of  information  that helps  those  who  want
to  kill Americans.  Structural  concerns,  along with  simple prudence,  argue  in
favor  of considerable  judicial  deference  to  presidential  choices when  national
security  is  at  risk.  These  points  provide  important  cautionary  notes;  they
help  to  explain  why  Liberty  Perfectionism  is  senseless.  But these considera-
tions  should  not  be  read  for  more  than  they  are  worth.  Far  from  requiring
National  Security  Fundamentalism,  the  Constitution  is  best read  to  forbid  it.
No one  doubts  that  the  president has  considerable  power  in the  domain
of national  security.  I  have  emphasized  that under  Article  II  he  is  explicitly
authorized  to  be  "Commander  in Chief  of the  Army  and  Navy  of the  United

States. ' 73  He  is  allowed  "to  make  Treaties,"  at  least  when  two-thirds  of the
senators  concur. 74  He  is  authorized  to  "appoint  Ambassadors"  and  "other
public  Ministers  and  Consuls. '75  He  "shall  receive  Ambassadors  and  other
public  Ministers.' ' 76  But  none  of this  supports  Justice  Thomas's  suggestion
that  the  president  has  "primary  responsibility-along  with  the  necessary
power-to  protect  the  national  security  and  to  conduct  the  Nation's  foreign
relations. '77  Nor does  anything in the  document  support  the Fourth Circuit's
suggestion  that  under  Article  II  "the  President  is  given  the  war  power. 78
Nor  does  the Constitution  support  the view,  at  least  implicit  in the  rulings  of
the D.C.  Circuit,  that  the  domain  of war  is the domain  of largely  unbounded
presidential  discretion. 79  On  the contrary,  that view  is  a  tendentious  reading
of the  legal  materials.  To  see  why,  let  us  turn  to  Article  I.

Perhaps  most  notably,  Congress,  rather  than  the  president,  has  the
power  "[t]o  declare  War. ''80  The  Constitution  also  grants  Congress,  not  the
president,  the  power  "[t]o  raise  and  support  Armies." ' 
It  authorizes  Con-
gress  "[t]o  provide  and  maintain  a  Navy."'8 2  In  a  formulation  that  bears  on
the  president's  supposedly  inherent power  to  torture  and  that  much  compli-
cates  any  claims  about  the  broad  power  of  the  commander  in  chief,  the
founding  document  permits  Congress  to  "make  Rules  for  the  Government
and  Regulation  of the land  and  naval  Forces. ' 83  It is  Congress  that is  author-
ized  to  raise funds  to "provide  for  the Common  Defence  and general  Welfare
of  the  United  States."84  Congress,  rather  than  the  president,  is  empowered
to  "regulate  Commerce  with  foreign  Nations."85  Congress is  also  authorized
to  "define  and  punish Piracies  and  Felonies committed  on the  high  Seas, and
Offences  against  the  Law  of Nations, ' 86  and  also  to  "make  Rules  concerning
Captures  on Land  and  Water." 87  It is  under Article  I,  not Article  II, that  the
Constitution allows suspension  of habeas corpus  "when  in  Cases  of Rebellion
or  Invasion  the public  Safety  may  require  it."88  The fact  that the  Suspension
Clause can be found  in Article  I tends to  suggest that Congress,  not the  presi-
dent,  is  entitled  to  suspend  the  writ.

[Vol.  73:693

In  this  light,  the  Constitution  does  not  repose  in  the  president  anything
like  the  general  authority  "to  protect  the  national  security. '89  On  the  con-
trary,  the more  natural  reading of the document  is that protection  of national
security  is parceled  out between  Congress  and the  president-and  that  if ei-
ther  has the  dominant role, it  is  the national  lawmaker.  To be sure, the Com-
mander  in  Chief  Clause  does  give  the  president  the  authority  to  direct  the
armed  forces,  an  expansive  authority;90  but even  that  authority  is  subject  to
legislative  constraints  because  Congress  controls  the  budget  and  because
Congress  can  choose  not to  declare  war.  And  if Congress  refuses  either  to
authorize  the use  of force  or to  declare  war,  the  president is  generally  not-
on  the  best  reading  of  the  document-entitled  to  commence  hostilities. 91
The  Commander  in  Chief  Clause  allows  the president  to  manage  wars;  but  it
does not  give him  "the  war  power."  All of this  means  that National  Security
Fundamentalism  cannot  claim  a strong  constitutional  pedigree.

Of course,  the  constitutional  text  is  hardly  all  there  is  to  our  constitu-
tional tradition.92  In  the domain  of separation of powers,  historical  practices
and changes  over time  are  highly relevant.  As Justice  Frankfurter  contended,
"[i]t  is  an  inadmissibly  narrow  conception  of  American  constitutional  law  to
confine  it  to  the  words  of the  Constitution  and  to  disregard  the  gloss  which
life  has  written  upon  them. ' 93  In  this  context,  an  understanding  of  that
"gloss"  greatly  favors  the  president.  There  can  be  no  doubt  that  for  ques-
tions  of  national  security  the  president  has  assumed  authority  that  the  text
alone  might  not sanction.  The  power  to make  war  is  a  leading  example;  the
president  has  long engaged  in  military  actions  without  the  kind  of legislative
authorization  that  Article  I  appears  to  require. 94

security 

Historical  "glosses"  on  constitutional  text  might  well  be  taken  to  argue
in  the  direction  of National  Security Fundamentalism.  They  make  it  plausi-
ble  to  contend  that  the  president  has  more  authority  in  the  domain  of  na-
to  contemplate.
tional 
Undoubtedly,  the  lower  courts  have  been  responding  in  part  to  that  fact.
Equally  undoubtedly,  the  increasing power  of the  president  is  largely  a prod-
uct  of  functional  considerations  having  to  do  with  the  rise  of  the  United
States  as  an  international  power  and  the  growing  need  for  energy  and  dis-
patch.  But even when the  document  is  thus glossed, it remains  tendentious  to

National Security, Liberty, and the D.C. Circuit

contend  that when the  nation is at risk,  the president  must be in charge  of the
apparatus  of government.  To  say  this  is  to  reject  a  constitutional  accommo-
dation  that, by  text  and  tradition  as  well,  unambiguously  retains  Congress's
role  as  the  nation's  lawmaker.

III.  The  Minimalist Alternative

If National  Security  Fundamentalism  is  to  be  rejected,  what  should  be

put in  its  place?  What  should  courts  do  instead?

I cannot  answer that question in this  space.95  It is  surely relevant  that, in
a  number of decisions, the  Supreme  Court has  rejected unlimited  presidential
authority  and  insisted  on  the  relevance  of  a  congressional  grant  of  power.96
For a  recent illustration, let us explore  the leading  alternative  to  the  approach
of the  D.C. Circuit  and  the  Fourth  Circuit-one  that  offers  a  very  different
understanding  both of  the constitutional  foundations  and the  appropriate  ju-
dicial  role.  In  the  relevant  decision,  the United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for
the  Second  Circuit  endorsed  a  form  of  minimalism  in  Padilla v.  Rumsfeld. 97
At issue  was  the  legality  of  the  detention  of Jose  Padilla,  an  American
citizen  held  as  an  enemy  combatant  after  having  been  seized  on  American
soil.98  The  court  squarely  rejected  the  claim,  urged  by  the  executive  and
rooted  in National  Security Fundamentalism,  that  the  "President  has  the  in-
herent  authority  to  detain  those  who  take  up  arms  against  this  country." 99
The  court  of appeals  correctly  emphasized  that  Articles  I  and  II  divide  the
war  powers,  rather  than  confer  them  on  the  executive  alone. °°  The  court
added  that the  grant  of numerous  war-related  powers  "to  Congress  is a  pow-
erful  indication  that,  absent  express  congressional  authorization,  the  Presi-
dent's  Commander-in-Chief  powers  do  not  support"  the  confinement  of  an
American citizen  captured on American  soil.10 1  It stressed  that Ex parte Qui-
rin,102  the  government's  best  precedent,  rested  on  congressional  authoriza-
tion  rather  than  on inherent  presidential  authority. 10 3

The key  issue thus  was whether  such  authorization  could be  found  here.
In  the court's  view, Congress's  authorization  to  use  "all  necessary  and  appro-
priate  force"  to  respond  to the  September  11 attacks' 4  should  be  understood
in  light  of the  Supreme  Court's several  efforts  to  ensure  that both  Congress
and  the  president,  rather  than  the  president  alone,  authorize  interferences

with  constitutionally  sensitive  interests. 10 5  The  Supreme  Court  thus had  em-
phasized  that  "'[i]n  interpreting  a  war-time  measure  we  must  assume  that
[the  purpose  of  Congress  and  the  Executive]  was  to  allow  for  the  greatest
possible  accommodation  between  those  liberties  and  the  exigencies  of
war." 10 6  In  Padilla the  court  of  appeals  said,  correctly,  that  no  clear  and
unmistakable  statement  could  be  found. 10 7  Such  a  statement  was  required,
and  hence  the  indefinite  detention  of  Padilla  was  beyond  the  President's
power.'08

This  decision is an  unambiguous  exercise in minimalism  at war.  It stands
in  sharp  contrast  with  the  National  Security  Fundamentalism  that  has domi-
nated  the  D.C.  Circuit.  I  am not sure  that on  the particular issue  the  Second
Circuit  was  correct;  the  authorization  for  the  use  of force  is  not  implausibly
interpreted  to  provide  a  basis  for  what  the  executive  did  in  Padilla.10 9

IV.  Lower  Courts, Ideology, and the Irresistible (?) Appeal of
National Security Fundamentalism

I  have  suggested  that  much  of the  appeal  of National  Security  Funda-
mentalism  lies in  functional  and  structural considerations.  Federal judges,  no
less  than  ordinary  citizens,  want to  support  the  president  when  the  nation  is
at risk.  Moreover,  it is not implausible to suggest that  aspects of the constitu-
tional  structure  argue  in  favor  of  National  Security  Fundamentalism.  But  I
have  suggested  that this approach  fits poorly  with the  founding  document,  all
things  considered.  When judges  adopt it,  why are  they doing so?  At least  in
the  recent  past,  I  believe  that  two  factors  have,  regrettably,  been  playing  a
significant  role.

A.  Republican Judges, Republican Presidents

The  first  factor  has  to  do with  the  likely  posture  of  Republican  judicial
appointees  confronted  with  the  efforts  of  a  Republican  president  to  protect
the nation  in the aftermath  of  an  attack.  No  one  can doubt  that Democratic
appointees  and  Republican  appointees  differ  with one  another  on many  cru-
cial  questions. 10  With  respect  to national  security,  there  is  reason  to  specu-
late  that  Republican  appointees  would  be  somewhat  more  likely  to  rule  in
favor  of presidential  authority  than Democratic  appointees.  (Nothing I  have
said  demonstrates  that  they  are  wrong  to  be  inclined  in  this  direction.)  But
their  tendency,  I  suggest,  is  likely  to  be  heightened  when  the  president  in
question 
this  effect  has  been
powerfully  documented;  Republican-appointed  judges  are  distinctly  willing
to  defer  to  Republican  presidents  in  the  general  domain  of  administrative

is  also  Republican. 

In  other  contexts,

National Security, Liberty, and the  D.C. Circuit

law-and  much  less  willing  to defer  to Democratic  presidents.111  I  have  not
done  an  empirical  analysis  of  lower-court  decisions  when  national  security
collides  with  liberty,  but  there  is  every  reason  to  believe  that  the  tendency  I
am  describing would  hold.

Here  is  a  more  concrete  way  to  put the  point.  It  is  possible  to  imagine
the  following  combinations  of  interactions:  Democratic  president,  Demo-
cratic-appointed  judges;  Democratic president,  Republican-appointed judges;
Republican  president,  Democratic-appointed  judges;  Republican  president,
Republican-appointed  judges.  My  speculation  is  that  when  presidents  are
taking  steps  to  protect  security  at  the  possible  expense  of  liberty,  the  likeli-
hood  of  a  judicial  victory  is  highest,  and  probably  by  far  the  highest,  when
Republican  judges are  assessing the  decisions  of a  Republican  president.  For
the other three possible  combinations,  federal judges are  more likely  to inval-
idate  presidential  actions  that  raise  serious  legal  difficulties.

I  am  suggesting,  then,  that  in  general  Democratic-appointed  judges
would  look  more  skeptically  at liberty-infringing  acts  by  the  chief  executive,
whether  Republican  or  Democratic,  and  that  Republican-appointed  judges
would  look  more  skeptically  at  intrusions  on  liberty  by  (say)  President  Clin-
ton than  at  intrusions  on  liberty  by  (say)  President  George  W.  Bush.  It  is
revealing  in  this  regard  that  the  primary  illustrations  of  National  Security
Fundamentalism  in  the  recent  past  have  come  from  Republican  appointees
speaking approvingly  of exercises  of authority  of President Bush.  Recall  that
Judge  Ray  Randolph  wrote  both  the  majority  and  the  concurring  opinion  in
Al  Odah; in addition, Judge  Harvey  Wilkinson  wrote  the  majority  opinion  in
Hamdi.  These  are  mere  examples,  and  nothing  I  am  saying  here  demon-
strates  that  these  judges  were  wrong  in  their  particular  conclusions.  I  am
making a  simple descriptive  (and  predictive)  point:  National  Security  Funda-
mentalism  will  have  most  appeal  to  Republican  appointees  on  the  lower
courts  when  the  president  whose  acts  are  at  issue is  also  Republican.

B.  Judicial Courage: A  Concluding Note

The final point has to  do with  the institutional  position  of lower  courts as
compared  with  the  institutional  position of the Supreme  Court of the  United
States.  To say  the  least,  it is  uncomfortable  for federal judges  to  invalidate  a
decision  of the  president.  Invalidation  of presidential  acts  is  particularly  un-
comfortable  when  national  security  is  at  risk.  Our  history  attests  to  this
point. 112  If  federal  judges  are  going  to  reject  a  presidential  decision  in  the
name  of  liberty,  they  will  have  to  demonstrate  a  great  deal  of  courage.
Lower  courts,  precisely  because  they  are  lower,  are  less  likely  to  show  that
courage.  Because  of  its unique  place  in  American  government  and  because
of its  national  prestige,  the  Supreme  Court  is  in  a  far  better  position  to  do
so. 113  This  is  not to  say that  the  Supreme  Court  will  reliably  protect  liberty,

l1l  See, e.g.,  Linda R.  Cohen  & Matthew  L. Spitzer, Solving the Chevron  Puzzle, 57  LAW  &
CONTEMP.  PROBS.  65  (1994)  (Finding  that  justices  are  far  more  likely  to  defer  to  an  agency's
statutory construction  when  the agency  is controlled  by  a president  of the same  political party  as
the justice).

112  See supra text  accompanying  note  72.
113  See  STONE,  supra note  3,  passim, for  a  catalogue  of cases  in  which  the  Supreme  Court

The  George Washington Law  Review

[Vol.  73:693

even  when  the legal  materials  call  for  it  to  do  so.  Judges  are  merely judges,
and  when  national  security  is  at  risk,  an  aggressive  judicial  role  is  neither
likely nor  desirable.  It is  for  this reason  that  Liberty  Perfectionism  is  a  non-
starter.  But  to the extent  that  federal judges  need  a  great deal  of courage  to
protect  constitutional  rights  when  the  stakes  are  high,  the  Supreme  Court  is
more  reliable  than  other judicial  institutions,  at  least  as  a  general  tendency.
The  best guess, then, is that lower  courts, including  the  D.C.  Circuit, will
be  inclined  to  follow the  constitutionally  mischievous  path of National  Secur-
ity  Fundamentalism.  I  hope  that  I  am  proved  wrong.

has  been  reluctant  to  protect liberty  amidst  a public  panic;  see  SUNSTEIN,  supra  note  4,  at 61-72,
for  a  suggestion  that  the  Court  has  often  protected  liberty  through  minimalist  rulings.
