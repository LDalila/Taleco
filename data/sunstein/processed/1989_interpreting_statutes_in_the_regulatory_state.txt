INTERPRETING  STATUTES  IN
THE  REGULATORY  STATE

Cass R.  Sunstein*

Discussing the judge's role in  interpreting statutes, Justice Holmes wrote
that "if  my fellow  citizens want to go  to Hell I  will help them.  It's my job."'
Critics of  the view  of the  courts as  passive  agents  of  the  legislature claim
that it  understates the  difficulty of  interpretation, the indeterminacy of both
the  language and the will  of the  citizens,  and the  resulting discretion of the
judge.  Similarly,  a  vigorous  debate  continues  over  the  proper role  of  the
the  text,  the  legislative
traditional sources  of  statutory  interpretation -
history, the purpose of the enacting Congress, and the structure of the statute.
Professor Sunstein  suggests  that  both  the  conventional understandings of
interpretation and the  recent critiques are seriously flawed.  Because inter-
pretation inevitably involves  the application of "background norms" -
often
controversial, value-laden,  and  not found  in  any  text  -
the  traditional
theories are incomplete.  These  theories, however, properly stress the  demo-
cratic primacy  of Congress.  When  congressional instructions are  clear and
do  not  create  absurdity, courts  should follow  them.  Often,  however,  the
instructions are ambiguous,  and judges  must choose from  a number of pos-
sible background norms.

Suggesting  that many  disputes  over statutory meaning are  in fact  dis-
agreements over appropriate background norms, Professor Sunstein contends
that the  debate should center on whether the proposed norms express a good
understanding of  constitutional values;  are properly  responsive  to  contem-
porary  institutional arrangements involving  the  making,  monitoring,  and
enforcement of  law;  and  are sensitive  to  the  aspirations and functions  as

well as the shortcomings of regulatory statutes.  Professor Sunstein concludes
by  outlining a series of norms -
some based on current interpretive practices,
others reflecting his  own  normative vision.  All  the  norms are  designed to
focus  disputes over statutory meaning more sharply on  the  underlying issues
and to  deepen understanding of the  regulatory state.

I.  INTRODUCTION

A.  The  Problem

TN  the  early  part  of  the  twentieth  century,  courts  often  treated
Iregulatory  statutes  as  foreign  substances. 2  Starting  from  principles
of laissez-faire,  judges  saw  statutory  protections  of  workers,  consum-
ers,  and  others  as  unprincipled  interest-group  transfers  supported  by
theories  that  were  at best  obscure  and  often  disingenuous. 3  By  con-
trast,  judge-made  doctrines  of property,  contract,  and  tort  seemed  to
create  a system  with  integrity  and  coherence.

The  role  of  the  courts  in  this  period  was  one  of  damage  control.
The  most  important  organizing  principle  for  interpretation  was  that
regulatory  statutes  should  be construed narrowly -
so  as to  harmonize
as  much  as  possible  with  principles  of  private  markets  and  private
rights. 4  This  approach  grew  out  of  the  idea  that  courts  should  nar-
rowly  construe  statutes  in  derogation  of  the  common  law.5

The New  Deal period  marked  an  enormous  change  in  the  size  and
character  of the  national  government. 6  The  decade  between  193o  and

2 See,  e.g.,  B.  CARDOZO,  THE  PARADOXES  OF  LEGAL  SCIENCE  9  (1928)  ("The  truth  is  that
many  of us, bred  in  common law  traditions,  view  statutes with  a  distrust which  we  may deplore,
but not deny.").

3 See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.  Elgin,  J.  & E.  Ry.,  298  U.S.  492  (1936);  FTC  v.  Eastman
Kodak  Co.,  274  U.S.  619,  623-25  (1927);  FTC  v. American  Tobacco  Co.,  264  U.S.  298,  305-
o6  (1924);  FTC  v.  Gratz,  253  U.S.  422,  427-28  (1920).

4 See,  e.g.,  cases  cited  supra note 3;  F.  FRANKFURTER  & N.  GREENE,  THE LABOR  INJUNC-
TION  165-82  (1930)  (exploring  the  federal  courts'  nullification  of  the  Clayton  Act);  see  also
Pound,  Common Law and Legislation, 22  HARV.  L.  REV.  383,  387-88,  4o6-07  (I9o8)  (criticizing
use  of  interpretive  principles  that  are  out  of  touch  with  contemporary  social  and  economic
thought);  Pound,  Courts and Legislation, 7  AM.  POL.-ScI.  REV.  361,  374-75  (1913)  (same).

This  principle  of narrow  construction,  like  many  others  of  the  past  and  present,  was  not
always  invoked  explicitly.  Often  it operated  invisibly  or  in the  background.  When  interpretive
principles  are  not  referred  to  expressly,  their  use  is  often  reflected  in  the  court's  treatment  of
the  statutory  language.  See  infra  pp.  437-41;  see  also  infra  pp.  464-66  (discussing  when
controversial  substantive  and  institutional  norms  should  be  applied).

5 See,  e.g.,  Shaw  v.  Railroad  Co.,  1oi  U.S.  557,  565  (1879);  Johnson v.  Southern  Pac.  Co.,
117  F.  462,  466  (8th  Cir.  2902),  rev'd,  x96  U.S.  I  (1904);  see also  Fordham  & Leach,  Interpre-
tation of Statutes  in Derogation of the  Common Law,  3  VAND.  L.  REV.  438,  450-5I  & nn.73-
74  (i5o) (listing cases  in which  courts  ignored statutes  instructing  them  not  to construe  statutes
narrowly).

STATE:  THE  EXPANSION  OF  NATIONAL  ADMINISTRATIVE  CAPACITIES,  1877-1920  (1982).

INTERPRETING STATUTES

seventeen  -

1940  saw  the  creation  of  as  many  agencies  -
as  had
been  created  in  the  entire  period  between  the  framing  of  the  Consti-
tution  and  the  close  of  the  nineteenth  century. 7  During  the  "rights
revolution"  of  the  196o's  and  1970's,  the  national  government  sub-
stantially  increased  its  regulatory  responsibilities  by  moving to  protect
the  interests  of  consumers,  the  national  environment,  and  victims  of
discrimination. 8  The  emergence  of  the  regulatory  state  represents  a
shift  in  both  the  substance  of  law  and  the  institutions  through  which
law  is  made  and  enforced, 9  and  the  sheer  volume  of  federal  statutes
and  regulations  has  dramatically  changed  the  business  of  the  federal
courts.' 0 
In  particular,  the  work  of  federal  judges  has  increasingly
involved  the  interpretation  of federal  enactments.

The  demands  of  the  modern  administrative  state  ultimately  made
it  impossible  for  courts  to  sustain  a  theory  of  interpretation  rooted  in
nineteenth-century  common  law.  As  a  result,  interpretive  practices
have  changed.  Courts  have  often  repudiated  private-law  baselines  for
interpreting  public  law  and  have  been  less  antagonistic  to  regulatory
statutes. 11

In  many  respects,  however,  the  theory  and  practice  of  public  law
have  not  outgrown  the  understandings  that underlay  the  initial  period
of  judicial  antagonism. 12  That  period  is  unmistakably  recalled  by

7 See  FINAL  REPORT  OF  THE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL'S  COMMITTEE  ON  ADMINISTRATIVE

PROCEDURE  7-I1  (1941).

s  For  comparisons  between  the  New  Deal  and  the  rights  revolution,  see  R.  HARRIS  &  S
MILKIS,  THE  POLITICS  OF  REGULATORY  CHANGE  53-96  (x989);  and  Vogel,  The  "New" Social
Regulation in Historical and Comparative Perspective, in  REGULATION  IN  PERSPECTIVE  155  (T.
McCraw  ed.  I98I).

9 See  generally  Sunstein,  Constitutionalism After  the  New  Deal,  ioi  HARV.  L.  REV.  421,

437-46  (1987)  (discussing  substantive  and  institutional  reform  in the  New  Deal  period).

10 The  proliferation  of statutes  in  modern  law  has  been  widely  observed  both  on  the  bench,
see,  e.g.,  R.  POSNER,  THE  FEDERAL  COURTS  53,  83-84  (1985);  Traynor,  Statutes Revolving  in
Common  Law  Orbits,  17  CATH.  U.L.  REV.  401,  402  (1968)  (observing  that  cases  "increasingly
involve  the  meaning  or  applicability  of  a  statute"),  and  in  academia,  see,  e.g.,  G.  GILMORE,
THE  AGES  OF  AMERICAN  LAW  95  (1977)  (describing  an  "orgy  of  statute  making").  Recent
statistics  confirm  these  intuitions.  In  1985,  for  example,  nearly  20%  of all  civil  filings  involved
four  regulatory  areas  -
social  security,  labor,  tax,  and  civil  rights.  See  ADMINISTRATIVE
OFFICE  OF  THE  UNITED  STATES  COURTS,  FEDERAL  JUDICIAL  WORKLOAD  STATISTICS  at  a-16
to  a-17  (1985)  (table  C-3).  Moreover,  because  most  commercial  disputes  have  been  absorbed
into  the  regulatory  arena  through  the  Uniform  Commercial  Code,  and  because  "contract  cases"
account  for  nearly  40%  of  all  filings,  see  id.,  the  federal  courts  probably  hear  many  more
statutory  than  common  law  claims.

11 See,  e.g.,  Switchmen's  Union  v.  National  Mediation  Bd.,  320  U.S.  297  (1943)  (denying
judicial  review  of  agency  decision);  Gray  v.  Powell,  314  U.S.  402  (1941)  (deferring  to  agency
interpretation  of law).

12 Over  8o years  ago,  Roscoe  Pound  voiced  similar  complaints  about  the  persistence  of
judicial  adherence  to common  law  principles.  See  Pound,  Common Law and Legislation, supra
note  4,  at  385-86;  accord Landis,  Statutes and the Sources of Law, in HARVARD  LEGAL  ESSAYS
213,  213  (1934).

[Vol.  103:405

recent  suggestions  that  courts  should  indulge  a  presumption  in  favor
of private  ordering  and  should  interpret  regulatory  statutes  so  as  to
intrude  minimally  on  the  private  market. 13  The  nineteenth-century
view  that  regulatory  statutes  should  be  viewed  against  a  background
of  common  law  property  and  contract  rights  and  hence  as  naked
wealth  transfers  also  finds  a modern  home,  in  the  increasingly  prom-
inent  idea  that  statutes  should  be  seen  as  unprincipled  "deals"  among
self-interested  private  actors. 14   Similarly,  those  who  emphasize  the
findings  of public  choice  theory  would  treat  statutes  as  lacking  coher-
ent normative  underpinnings. ' 5

The  initial  judicial  skepticism  about  the  legitimacy  and' coherence
of  statutory  law  is  also  recalled  by  both  poles  of  the  contemporary
debate  over  the  possibility  of constrained  or  objective  legal  interpre-
tation.  At  one  extreme,  some  courts  and  observers  see  the  text  or
"plain  meaning"  of  statutory  language  as  the  exclusive  or  principal
guide  to  meaning. 16  At  the  opposite  extreme,  other  commentators
claim  that  legal  terms  are  quite  generally  indeterminate 7  or  have  the
meaning  that  those  with  authority  choose  to  impose  on  them.' 8  De-
spite their  differences,  the two  camps  share  a number  of  assumptions.
Both  treat regulatory  statutes  as  an  undifferentiated  and  unprincipled
whole,  without distinct  and  accessible  purposes.  Because  members  of
both  camps  see  no  way to mediate  the  sharp ideological  disagreements
that  sometimes  underlie  interpretive  disputes,  some  are  driven  to  the

13 See,  e.g.,  J.  RABKIN,  JUDICIAL  COMPULSIONS:  How  PUBLIC  LAW  DISTORTS  PUBLIC
POLICY  (1989);  Easterbrook,  Statutes' Domains, 5o  U.  CHI.  L. REV.  533,  544-5I  (1983).  Many
recent  decisions  appear  to  respond  to  a  principle  in  favor  of  private  ordering.  See,  e.g.,
Independent  Fed'n  of  Flight  Attendants  v.  Zipes,  109  S.  Ct.  2732  (1989)  (discussed  below  in
note  305);  Wards  Cove  Packing  Co.  v. Atonio,  109  S.  Ct.  2115  (1989)  (discussed  below  at pp.

(1984);  Pennhurst  State  School  &  Hosp.  v.  Halderman,  451  U.S.  I,  24-25  (i98i)  (discussed
below  at  pp.  500-02).

'S For  a  discussion  of  public  choice  theory,  see  Plott,  Axiomatic  Social Choice Theory:  An
Overview  and Interpretation, in  RATIONAL  MAN  AND  IRRATIONAL  SOCIETY?  231  (B.  Barry  &
R.  Hardin  eds.  1982).  See  generally  K.  ARROW,  SOCIAL  CHOICE  AND  INDIVIDUAL  VALUES
(1951);  J.  BUCHANAN  &  G.  TULLOCx,  THE  CALCULUS  OF  CONSENT  (x962).  The  treatment  in
H.  HART  & A.  SACKS,  THE  LEGAL  PROCESS  (tent.  ed.  1958),  runs into  severe  problems  because
of its failure  to  appreciate  the difficulties  raised by work  of this sort.  My ultimate  goal, however,
is  to  revive  important  elements  of the  treatment  in  The Legal Process, rather  than  to  celebrate
its  demise  or to  emphasize  its  occasional  nalvet6  about  politics  and interpretation.

16 This  view  is  currently  enjoying  a  renaissance  in  the courts.  See  cases  cited  infra note  29;

it expressly  addresses  the issue  in  question).

INTERPRETING  STATUTES

pretense  that  words  quite  generally  have  "plain  meanings,"  others  to
the  uninformative  view  that meaning  is  a  function  of authority,  others
to  the  demonstrably  false  claim  that  statutes  are  usually indeterminate
in  meaning,  and  still  others  to  the  open-ended  suggestion  that statutes
should  be  interpreted  so  as  to  be  "reasonable"  or  "the  best  that  they
can  be." 1 9 
In  the  face  of  contentions  of  this  sort,  debates  about
statutory  interpretation,  in  and  out  of  the  judiciary,  often  dissolve
into  fruitless  and  unilluminating  disputes  about  the  constraints  sup-
plied  by  language  "itself"  (as  if  such  a  thing  could  be  imagined).

B.  Interpretive Principles

My  project  is  to  develop  a  theory  of  statutory  construction  that
not  only  sheds  light  on  current  practices  but  also  might  claim  to  be
worthy  of  adoption.  In  carrying  out  that  task,  it  is  first necessary  to
set  out  the  proper  relationships  among  the  traditional  sources  of in-
terpretation,  including  text,  structure,  purpose,  intent,  and  history.  A
large  part  of  the  solution,  however,  lies  in  the  identification  and
development  of  interpretive  principles  with  which  to  approach  regu-
latory  statutes. 20  The  meaning  of  a  statute  inevitably  depends  on  the
precepts  with  which  interpreters  approach  its  text.  Statutes  do  not
have  pre-interpretive  meanings,  and  the  process  of  interpretation  re-
quires  courts  to  draw  on  background  principles.  These  principles  are
usually  not  "in"  any  authoritative  enactment  but  instead  are  drawn
from  the  particular  context  and,  more  generally,  from  the  legal  cul-
ture.2 1  Disagreements  about  meaning  often  turn  not  on  statutory
terms  "themselves,"  but  instead  on  the  appropriate  interpretive  prin-

19  See  R.  DWORKIN,  LAW'S  EMPIRE  337-38  (x986)  (arguing  that  judges  should  interpret
statutes  "in  the best  light overall");  Llewellyn,  Remarks on the Theory of Appellate Decision and
the  Rules  or Canons About  How  Statutes Are  To  Be  Construed, 3  VAND.  L.  REV.  395,  399
(1950)  (suggesting  that  courts  interpret  statutes  to  "make  sense").

20  It  is  important  to  emphasize  that  my  approach  is  directed  to  regulatory  statutes.  I  refer
to  other  measures,  including  criminal  law,  largely  by  way  of analogy.  Much  of  the  discussion,
however,  bears  on  statutory  interpretation  in  general.

21  The  illuminating  treatment  in  Eskridge,  Public Values  in Statutory Interpretation, 137  U.
PA.  L.  REV.  1007  (i989),  presents  a  number  of these  background  norms,  including  the idea  that
courts  should defer  to  administrative  interpretations  of law  if Congress  has  not clearly  addressed
the  issue,  see  Chevron  U.S.A.,  Inc.  v. Natural  Resources  Defense  Council,  Inc.,  467  U.S.  837,
842  (1984);  that  criminal  statutes  should  be  construed  in  accordance  with  the  "rule  of  lenity,"
see  Eskridge,  supra, at  1029;  and  that  statutes  and  treaties  should  be  construed  favorably  to
Indian  tribes,  see id. at  1047.

Eskridge's  treatment  is  flawed,  however,  by  the  implicit assumption  that  the role  of  "public
values"  in  interpretive  disputes  is  to  add  to  ordinary  interpretation,  or to  bend  the  meaning  of
statutes  in  various  directions.  See  id. at  1045-47.  For reasons  suggested  below,  see infra pp.
416-25,  ordinary  interpretation  is  also  pervaded  by  "public  values";  the  dichotomy  between
interpretation  that rests  on  fidelity  to  text and  interpretation  that is  based  on  extratextual  values
greatly  oversimplifies  the  problem  and is  in important  respects  a  false  one.

ciples.  Courts  sometimes  make  the  governing  norms  explicit,  but
frequently  leave  them  unarticulated  and  latent.  The  principles  are
often  misdirected  or  at least  controversial.

In  these  circumstances,  it  is  important  to  identify  the  prevailing
principles  and  to  subject  them  to  scrutiny.  The  ultimate  task  is  to
develop  norms  of  statutory  interpretation  that  grow  out  of,  and  do
not  collide  with,  the  basic  purposes  of the  constitutional  framework,
of contemporary  institutional  arrangements,  and  of modern  social  and
economic  regulation.  Above  all,  it  is  important  to  develop  principles
that  improve  the  performance  of  modern  government,  and  that  are
not  based  on  pre-New  Deal  understandings,  which  seem  to  have
overstayed  their  welcome.

To  carry  out  this  task,  it  will  be  necessary  to  develop  distinctive
understandings  about  both  the  nature  of  legal  interpretation  and  the
character  of  modern  public  law.  Because  interpretation  is  a function
of  background  norms  and  cannot  proceed  without  them,  theories
about  statutory  "meaning"  cannot  be  separated  from  theories  about
how  the  modern  regulatory  state  does  and  should  operate.  When
interpretive  norms  are  contested,  and  when  neither  the  Constitution
nor the  Congress  has specified  the proper  norms,  there is  no alternative
but  to  base  the  inevitably  value-laden  choice  among  them  on  their
role  in  improving  or  impairing  governmental  performance.

In  the  course  of  the  discussion,  I  reject  a  number  of  generally

accepted  understandings  about  statutory  construction:

o  courts  must always  adhere to  the  original  meaning  of the  statute,

or  the  original  intent  of the  enacting  legislature;

o  courts  are  or  can  be  mere  agents  of the  Congress;

o statutory  meaning  remains  constant  over  time;

o  statutory  meaning  is  equivalent  to  legislative  intent;

o controversial  views  about  public  policy  are  never  and  should

never  be  part  of statutory  construction;

o canons  of  construction,  or  background  interpretive  norms,  are

an  outmoded  and  unhelpful  guide  to  the  courts.

All  of these  aspects  of the  conventional  wisdom,  I suggest,  are  incon-
sistent  with  actual  judicial  behavior.  Moreover,  they  provide  incom-
plete  instructions  and  often  produce  perverse  results.

The  discussion  proceeds  in  three  stages.  Part  II  rejects  the  usual
understandings  of how  courts  do  and  should  construe  statutes.  It also
suggests  the  proper  uses  of  the  traditional  sources  of  interpretation:
text,  structure,  purpose,  congressional  intent,  and  legislative  history.
The  recent  emphasis  on  the  primacy  of  the  text  is  a  step  in  the  right
direction,  but  structure,  purpose,  intent,  and  history  sometimes  help

INTERPRETING STATUTES

to  clarify  ambiguities  or  to  prevent  unnecessary  or  unintended  irra-
tionality  and  injustice.  I  also suggest  that the  traditional  sources  offer
incomplete  guidance  and  that  their  incompleteness  reveals  the  inevi-
table  failure  of the agency  conception  of the judicial  role.  At the same
time,  I reject  the view  that  statutory disputes  produce  "indeterminacy"
in most or all  cases  and the  related  idea that such disputes  are resolved
on  the  basis of conventions  that are  not subject  to evaluation.  Finally,
I criticize,  though  on quite  different  grounds,  the  use of certain  widely-
held  extratextual  norms  to  resolve  statutory  disputes:  private  auton-
omy,  deference  to  agency  interpretations,  and  conceptions  of statutes
as  "deals."

Part  Ill  attempts  to  understand  statutory  construction  by  means
of  a  general  defense  of  the  much-maligned  "canons"  of  construction,
understood  as  background  principles  designed  to help  discern  statutory
meaning.  I  defend  the  use  of such  principles  by  disaggregating  their
various  functions  and  by suggesting  that  the  use  of background  norms
is  desirable  and  in  any  case  inevitable.  I  also  suggest  that  several
current  substantive  norms  can  be supported  through  an  understanding
of  the  ways  in  which  they  incorporate  constitutional  principles,  pro-
mote  deliberation  in  government,  and  respond  to  New  Deal  reforms
of the  legal  system.

Part  IV  proposes  a  series  of  interpretive  principles  for  judicial
adoption  in  the  regulatory  state.  I  argue  that  many  such  principles,
whether  existing  in  current law  or proposed  here,  can  be defended  by
reference  to  constitutional  norms;  that  others are  based  on  assessments
of  the  performance  of various  governmental  institutions;  and  that  still
others  are  an  effort  to  counteract  some  of  the  failings  in  regulatory
systems.  A  general  purpose  of  Part  IV  is  to  describe  and  defend
principles  that will  serve  the  purposes of deliberative  government  and,
in particular,  will alleviate  rather than  aggravate  the defects  in modern
regulatory  programs.

Although  these  suggestions  are  designed  principally  for  reviewing
courts  in  hard cases,  their  implications  extend  to  administrative  agen-
cies  attempting  to  implement  statutes,  and  to  Congress  in  its  efforts
to  design  and  reform  social  and  economic  regulation.  Debates  over
statutory  meaning are  often  disputes  over  interpretive  principles;  these
debates  reflect  broader  divisions  over  the  nature  and  performance  of
the  regulatory  state  and,  indeed,  about  the  character  of  American
democracy  and  constitutionalism  as  a whole. 22

22 The  study  of  statutory  construction  is  therefore  one  part  of  a  more  general  effort  to
understand  the  performance  of  modern  regulatory  institutions  -
an  effort  that  will  ultimately
make  it necessary  to  focus  more  on  Congress,  the  President,  and  the  bureaucracy  than  on  the
courts.  For  discussion  in  this  vein,  see  J.  MAsHAW  & B.  HARFST,  THE  FREEDOM  MACHINE

II.  STANDARD  APPROACHES  TO  STATUTORY  INTERPRETATION

In  the  conventional  account,  the tools  of statutory  construction  are
language,  structure,  and  history.  The  weight  of  each  of  these  has
been  sharply  contested,  especially  in  recent  years. 23  Disputes  over
questions  of this  sort have  produced a range of approaches  to  statutory
construction,  all  with  support  in  the  case  law.  Each,  however,  is
flawed.  My  purpose  here  is  to  explain  how  these  approaches  fail,
both  as  positive  accounts  of how  courts  in  fact  approach  statutes  and
as  normative  theories  of interpretation.

This  Part  is  divided  into  three  sections.  The  first  deals  with
theories  that  see  courts  as  agents  of  the  legislature  and  that  charge
courts  with the  duty to implement legislative  decisions.  These  theories
fail  because  they ignore  the  inevitable  use  of interpretive  principles  in
the  process  of  construction.  Arguing  that  it  is  possible  to  choose
among  interpretive  principles,  the  second  section  rejects  both  conven-
tionalist  accounts  of meaning  and  the  view  that  statutory  interpreta-
tion  produces  "indeterminacy. '24  The  third  section  considers  three
prominent  approaches  that  do  invoke  supplemental  principles;  it  sug-
gests  that  these  approaches  also  fail,  largely  because  the  relevant
principles  are  difficult  to  defend.

23 Compare  Hirschey  v.  Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Comm'n,  777  F.2d  x,  7-8  (D.C.  Cir.
i985)  (Scalia,  J.,  concurring)  (criticizing  use  of  legislative  history)  and  B.  ACKERMAN  &  W.
HASSLER,  CLEAN  CoAL/DIRTY  AIR  1o8-o9  (198i)  (same)  with  Farber  &  Frickey,  Legislative
Intent and Public Choice,  74  VA.  L.  REV.  423  (x988)  (arguing  in  favor  of attention  to legislative
history).

24  All  interpretation  involves  the  application  of norms.  Some  of these  "norms" are  not  open
to  change  or  even  to  discussion.  There  is  a  difference,  at least  in  principle,  between  the  sorts
of  understandings  that  make  ordinary  words  intelligible  and  the  sorts  of  interpretive  principles
that  give  meaning  to  statutory  gaps  or  that  resolve  cases  that are  otherwise  in  equipoise  -
as,
for  example,  in  the  norms  in  favor  of  state  autonomy  or  judicial  review.  Participation  in  the
set  of  practices  that  make  ordinary  words  intelligible  is  probably  best  conceived  of  not  as
interpretation  but  as  understanding.  See  L.  WITTGENSTEIN,  PHILOSOPHICAL  INVESTIGATIONS
§  2O,  at  81  (G.  Anscombe  trans.  1972)  (discussing  a  way  "of grasping  a  rule  which  is  not an
interpretation, but which  is  exhibited  in  what  we  call  'obeying  the  rule'  and  'going  against  it'
in  actual  cases"  (emphasis  in  original)).  This  point  holds  even  though  one's  participation  in
those  practices  is  conditional  on  a  wide  range  of background  understandings  that  are  not  "part"
of  words  "themselves."

The  distinction  is  important  because  it is  sufficient,  for  purposes  of background  understand-
ings  of  this  sort,  that  there  be  a  social  consensus  on  their  behalf.  Communication  is  possible
only  because  of  that  consensus.  But  with  respect  to  interpretive  principles  that  are  part  of
interpretation  -
for  example,  the idea  that  silence  on  the  question  of federal  preemption  means
that state law continues to exist -
a consensus  may be  inadequate  if there  are no  good arguments
on  behalf  of  that  consensus.  In  these  latter  cases,  interpretive  principles  are  at  least in  theory
subject  to  evaluation  and  to  replacement  by  alternatives.  A  pervasive  problem  with  conven-
tionalist  accounts  of meaning  is  that  they  treat  all  interpretation  as  akin  to  the  sorts  of  under-
standings  that  make  ordinary  words  intelligible.  See  infra pp.  442-43  (discussing  convention-
alism).  I am  grateful  to  Thomas  Nagel  for  help  with  this  point.

INTERPRETING STATUTES

A.  Courts As  Agents

According  to  the  most  prominent  conception  of the  role  of  courts
in  statutory  construction,  judges  are  agents  or  servants  of the  legis-
lature. 25  On  the  agency  view,  courts  should  say  what  the  statute
means,  relying  on  its  language,  structure,  and  history.  Background
norms,  policy  considerations,  indeed  all  "outside  sources,"  are  imma-
terial.  The judicial  task  is  to  discern  and  apply  a judgment  made  by
others,  most  notably  the  legislature.

The  agency  view  is  usually  defended  by  a claim  of judicial  legiti-
macy.2 6  In  a  democratic  system,  with  an  electorally  accountable  leg-
islature  and  separated  powers,  it  is  said  to  be  the  appropriate  and
indeed  constitutionally  prescribed  role  of the courts  to  apply legislative
commands;  it  is  thus  impermissible  for  them  to  invoke  considerations
that  cannot  be  traced  to  an  authoritative  text.  The  claim  of illegiti-
macy  is  buttressed  by (and  perhaps  reducible  to)  a range  of prudential
considerations:  the  use  of outside  sources  will  tend  to  increase judicial
discretion,  decrease  legislative  attentiveness,  produce  uncertainty,  and
risk  usurpation  by  judges  of  powers  reserved  for  legislative  and  ex-
ecutive  actors. 27  Justice  Holmes  provided  a particularly  crisp  expres-
sion  of the  agency  view:  after  describing  a regulatory  statute  as  "fool-
ish,"  he  added,  "if  my  fellow  citizens  want  to  go  to  Hell  I  will  help
them.  It's  my job." 28

The  agency  view  appears  in  several  competing  forms,  and  much
of  the  history  of statutory  construction  consists  of shifts  and  disputes
among  the  various  possible  sources  of  the  instructions  of  the  courts'
"principal,"  the  legislature.  I  discuss  several  variations  here.

i.  Textualism.  -

It  is  sometimes  suggested  that  statutory  lan-
guage  is  the  source  of judicial  power  and  the  only  legitimate  object
of judicial  concern.  Textualism  appears  to  be  enjoying  a  renaissance
in  a  number  of  recent  cases, 2 9  and  perhaps  in  the  academy  as

25 This  conception  has  strong  roots  in  the  American  legal  tradition,  see,  e.g.,  Schooner
Paulina's  Cargo  v.  United  States, 
I  U.S.  (7  Cranch)  52,  6o  (1812)  (Marshall,  C.J.)  ("In
construing  these  laws,  it has  been  truly stated to  be the  duty of the  court to  effect the intention
of  the  legislature.").  For  more  modern  advocates  of  the  agency  conception,  see  cases  cited  in
note  29  below.

26  See,  e.g.,  Easterbrook,  supra note  13,  at  534  n.2  ("If  statutes'  words  do  not  convey

meaning  and  bind judges,  why  should judges'  words  bind  or  even  interest  the rest  of us?").

27  In  this  sense,  the  debate  resembles  the  debate  over  formalism  in  constitutional  law.  See
generally Brest,  The  Misconceived  Quest for the  Original Understanding, 6o  B.U.L.  REV.  204
(198o).

well, 30  partly  because  of  dissatisfaction  with  alternative  interpretive
strategies,  taken  up  below,  which  counsel  courts  to  rely  on  "purpose"
or  to  produce  "reason"  in  regulatory  regimes. 3 1

Several considerations  argue  in  favor of textualist  strategies.  First,
textualism  contains  an  important  and  often  overlooked  truth.  Statu-
tory  terms  are  the  enactment  of the  democratically  elected  legislature
and  represent  the  relevant  "law."  Statutory  terms  -
not  legislative
history,  not legislative  purpose,  not  legislative  "intent" -
have  gone
through  the  constitutionally  specified  procedures  for  the  enactment  of
law.  Second,  resort  to  the  text  promotes  goals  associated  with  the
rule  of law:  citizens  have  access  to  the  statutory  words  and  can  most
readily  order  their  affairs  in  response  to  those  words.  Third,  the
words  of a  statute,  considered  in  light  of widely  shared  conventions
about  how  they  should  be  understood,  often  have  only  one  plausible
interpretation,  or  at least  sharply  constrain  the  territory  of legitimate
disagreement.  Finally,  an  emphasis  on  the  primacy  of the  text  serves
as  a  salutary  warning  about  the  potential  abuses  of  judicial  use  of
statutory  "purpose"  and  of legislative  history. 32

Some  textualists  emphasize  the  "plain  meaning"  or dictionary  def-
inition  of  statutory  terms;  others  are  more  sensitive  to  the  particular
settings.  In  its  purest  form,  however,  the  textualist  approach  is  in-
adequate.  The central  problem  is  that the  meaning  of words  (whether
"plain"  or  not) depends  on  both  culture and  context.  Statutory  terms
are  not  self-defining,  and  words  have  no  meaning  before  or  without
interpretation. 33  To  say  this  is  emphatically  not  to  say  that  words

452-53  (1987)  (Scalia,  J., concurring  in  the judgment).  In  Green  v.  Bock  Laundry  Mach.  Co.,
1o9 S.  Ct.  I98I (i989),  however,  all  nine  Justices  refused  to  follow  the  dictionary  meaning  of
the  text  because  it  would  have  produced  an  absurd  result.  See  id.  at  1984-85;  id.  at  1994
(Scalia,  J.,  concurring);  id.  at  i995  (Blackmun,  J.,  dissenting);  see  also  Public Citizen,  lo9
S.  Ct.  at  2565-67  (I989).

30  For  example,  once-Professor  and  now-Judge  Easterbrook  has  defended  textualism  with

insight  and  vigor.  See,  e.g.,  Easterbrook,  supra note  13.

31  As  we  will  see,  strategies  of  that  sort were  suggested  by  commentators  who  disregarded
or  downplayed  the existence  of controversy  about what "reason" required  or  about the  "purposes"
of  statutory  regimes,  and  who  failed  to  come  to  terms  with  the  existence  of sharp,  ideologically
based  disagreements  on  such  questions.  See  infra pp.  426-28,  435-36.  Textualism  relies  on
firm  linguistic  anchors  to  control  ideological  divisions.  It  is  here  that  there  is  a  commonality
between  those  who  believe  that  legal  interpretation  is  inevitably  indeterminate  -
because  of
ideological  strife  -
and those  who,  embracing  textualism,  do  so for  essentially  the  same  reason.

32  See  infra pp.  427-28  (purpose),  429-31  (legislative  history).
33  Consider  Learned  Hand's  view:  "Words  are  not  pebbles  in  alien  juxtaposition;  they  have
only a  communal  existence;  and  not only does  the meaning  of each  interpenetrate  the  other,  but
all  in  their  aggregate  take  their  purport  from  the setting  in  which  they  are  used  . .. 
."  NLRB
v.  Federbush  Co.,  121  F.2d  954,  957  (2d  Cir.  194);  see  also  Shell  Oil  Co.  v.  Iowa  Dep't  of
Revenue,  log  S. Ct.  278,  281  & n.6  (I989)  (quoting Federbush).

The  dependence  of  meaning  on  culture  and  context  is  a  conventional  point  in  both  Anglo-
American  and  Continental  philosophy.  See,  e.g.,  L.  WITTGENSTEIN,  supra note  24  (Anglo-
American  version);  H.  GADAMER,  TRUTH  AND  METHOD  (trans.  2d  ed.  1975)  (Continental

INTERPRETING STATUTES,

used  in  statutes  or  elsewhere  can  mean  anything  at  all. 34  But it  is  to
say  that  statutory  terms  are  indeterminate  standing  "by  themselves,"
and,  even  more  important,  they  never  stand  by  themselves.  The
significance  of  congressional  enactments  necessarily  depends  on  the
context  and  on  background  understandings  about  how  words  should
be  understood.  Moreover,  reliance  on  ordinary  or  dictionary  defini-
tion,  without  reference  to  context,  will  sometimes  lead  to  interpretive
blunders.

Usually  the  context does  not prevent  reliance on  ordinary meaning,
and  usually  the  background  principles  are  so  widely  shared  -
for
example,  that  Congress  is  speaking  in  English,  that  Congress  is  not
joking  or  attempting  to  mislead,  that  statutes  have  purposes,  or  that
judges  should  not  decide  cases  simply  according  to  their  predilections
-
that  they  are  invisible.  Even  in  easy  cases,  however,  courts  must
resort  to  background  principles.  For  example,  the  question  whether
the  enactment  of  federal  environmental  statutes  preempts  all  of  state
tort  law  is  an  easy  one,  not because  of the  statutory  text  "itself,"  but
because  of shared  understandings  about  the  limited  preemptive  effect
of  federal  enactments. 36

[Vol.  103:405

Those  who accept  textualist  approaches  might  agree that the  mean-
ing  of  words  is  partly  a  function  of  the  context  and  of  background
norms  about how  texts should  be approached.  Indeed,  we  may define
an  easy  case  as  one  in  which  the  context  produces  no  dispute  and
there  is  a  consensus  about  the  governing  norms. 3 7  In  many  hard
cases,  however,  the  source  of  the  difficulty  is  that  the  particular
background  norm  and  the  nature  of  its  application  will  be  highly
controversial.  Textualism  or  "plain  meaning"  approaches  can  resolve
these  questions  only  by  covertly  introducing  background  principles,
which  are  often  controversial.

Consider  the  question  whether  a  statute  creating  a  regulatory
agency  to  police  racial  discrimination  in  employment  implicitly  au-
thorizes  victims  of  discrimination  to  bring  private  suits  against  em-
ployers  who  allegedly  have  engaged  in  discrimination.  If  the  statute
and  its  history  do  not  resolve  the  question,  the  introduction  of back-
ground  norms  is  necessary  to  discern  the  meaning  of the  statute.  It
should  thus be unsurprising  that judges  skeptical  about implied  causes
of  action  have  relied  not  on  statutory  "text"  but  instead  on  a  highly
controversial  background  assumption,  traceable  to  a  particular,  con-
testable  understanding  of separation  of  powers,  that  only  the  legisla-
ture  may  create  such  rights,  and  that  statutory  silence  should  be
assumed  not to  do  So. 38  Without  that  assumption  or  a different  one,
statutory  silence  on  the  existence  of an  implied  cause  of  action  has  no
meaning.

Background  norms  are  ubiquitous  in  any  legal system,  and  indeed
in  grammar  itself;  they  are  necessary  to  make  reliance  on  "text"  an
intelligible  concept.  These  considerations  account  for  the  pervasive
difficulties  with  textualist  approaches  to  statutory  construction:  am-
biguity  or vagueness,  overinclusiveness,  underinclusiveness,  delegation
or  gap-filling,  and  changed  circumstances.

(a) Ambiguity  or  Vagueness.  - The  most  familiar  problem  with
textualism 
is  sometimes  ambiguous  or
vague.  To  say  that  courts  should  rely  on  the  words  or  on  their

is  that  statutory  language 

unambiguous,  not  because  of  the  text  "itself,"  but because  of  the  strong  presumption,  created
by  courts  but  now  widely  shared,  in  favor  of judicial  review  of  administrative  behavior.  See
infra PP.  475-76.

INTERPRETING STATUTES

ordinary meaning -
the  plain  meaning approach  -
is unhelpful  when
statutory  words  have  more  than  one  dictionary  definition,  or  when
the  context  produces  interpretive  doubt.  It  is  not  clear,  for  example,
whether  the  term  "feasible"  contemplates  a  cost-benefit  analysis,  or
whether  a  prohibition  of  "discrimination"  bars  voluntary  race-con-
scious  measures  designed  to  counteract  the  effects  of past  and  present
discrimination  against  blacks. 39  In  both  of  these  cases,  moreover,  it
is  uncertain  whether  the  language  should  be  taken  to  refer  to  the
original  meaning  of those  words  for the  enacting  legislature  (assuming
that  idea  can  be  made  intelligible  in  light  of the  problems  of  aggre-
gating  the  views  of numerous  actors)  or  should  instead  take  account
of contemporary  understandings  of what  the  words  mean.  Indeed,  it
is  not  even  clear  what  bearing the  desires,  or interpretive  instructions,
of the  enacting  legislature  should  have  for  judicial  interpretation.  By
itself,  textualism  cannot  answer  these  questions.  Nor  can  the  agency
conception  of the judicial  role  resolve  such  problems.

(b)  Overinclusiveness.40  -

If textualism  is  taken,  as  it often  is,  to
call  for  reliance  on  the  literal4 1  language  of statutory  words  -
their
dictionary  definition  or  meaning  in  ordinary  settings  -
it  will  some-
times  suggest  an  outcome  that makes  little  or no  sense.  For  example,
suppose  that  a  state  law  says  that  no  vehicles  are  permitted  in  public
parks,  and  a  city  proposes  to  build  in  a park  a  monument  consisting
of tanks  used  in  World  War  l.42  The literal  language  must yield,  for
the  statute  could not reasonably  be taken to forbid a monument,  which
causes  none  of the  harms  the  statute  could  be  thought  to  prevent.

A  passage  from  Wittgenstein  indicates  the  basic  difficulty:  "Some-
one  says  to  me:  'Shew  the  children  a  game.' 
I  teach  them  gaming
with  dice,  and  the  other  says  'I  didn't mean  that sort  of game.'  Must
the  exclusion  of the  game  with  dice  have  come  before  his  mind  when
he  gave  me  the  order?" 43  The  example  shows  that  sometimes  the  best
interpretation  of  a  textual  command  is  one  that  runs  counter  to  its
apparent  literal  meaning  -
even  if the  author  did  not have  in  mind
the  case  at issue,  or make  a judgment  about  how  that case  should  be
resolved.

39 See,  e.g.,  Industrial  Union  Dep't,  AFL-CIO  v.  American  Petroleum  Inst.,  448  U.S.  607
(198o)  (plurality  opinion) (interpreting "feasible");  United  Steelworkers  of America v. Weber,  443
U.S.  193,  201-02  (,979) (rejecting an  interpretation  of "discriminate"  that would  bar affirmative
action).

40  "Overinclusiveness"  and  "underinclusiveness,"  as  used  in  the  text,  refer  to  the  fact  that
the best  interpretation  of a  word,  all  things  considered,  sometimes  calls  for  a  restriction  on  or
a  departure  from  a  word's  dictionary  meaning.

41  The  notion  of  "literal" meaning  is  a  crude  one.  It  usually  refers  to  the meaning  of  words
in  "most"  contexts,  but  because  meaning  is  a  function  of  context,  it is  wrong to  suggest,  as  the
concept of "literal  meaning"  does,  that  words  have  context-independent  meanings.

42  This famous  example  comes  from  H.L.A.  HART,  THE  CONCEPT  OF  LAw  121-32  (1961).

HARVARD  LAW  REVIEW

[Vol.  103:405

Courts  encounter  the  problem  of  overinclusiveness  frequently. 44
The  Supreme  Court  recently  held  that  a  statute  exempting  state  and
local  public  housing  obligations  "from  allt  taxation  . . . imposed  by
the  United  States"  should  not be  interpreted  to  include  an  exemption
from  federal  estate  tax. 4 5  The  Court  held  that  the  exemption  did  not
mean  what  it appeared  to  say  in  light of the  contemporaneous  under-
standing  that  an  excise  tax  was  not  ordinarily  comprehended  within
the  category  of  "taxation. '46  As  another  example,  suppose  that  the
legislature  has  said  that  an  employer  may  discharge  an  employee  "for
any  reason."  Is  the  employer  thereby  authorized  to  fire  workers  who
have  refused  to  commit  crimes  on  his  behalf ?  If a state  law  says  that
one  spouse  will  inherit  from  another  "in  all  circumstances,"  may  a
husband who has murdered  his  wife  make a claim against  the estate? 47
These  are  examples  of what  might  be  described  as  the  overinclusive-
ness  of  a  prominent  version  of  textualism:48  the  possibility  that  sta-
tutory  language,  read  without  sufficient  regard  to  context  or  its  in-
tended  field  of  application,  will  reach  situations  that  it  could  not
reasonably  cover.

(c)  Underinclusiveness. - Although  it arises  less  frequently,  there
is  also  a  possibility  that  textualism  will  be  underinclusive.  Justice
Holmes  warned  that  "[c]ourts  are  apt  to  err  by sticking  too  closely  to
the  words  of  a  law  where  those  words  import  a  policy  that  goes
beyond  them."'49  A  particular  difficulty  here  is  that  a  statute  may  be

INTERPRETING STATUTES

"evaded" by private  ingenuity.  The literal  language  of the  statute  does
not  cover  the  situation,  but  because  the  private  conduct  causes  all  of
the  harms  that  the  statute  could  be  thought  to  prevent,  courts  some-
times  hold a statute  applicable  notwithstanding  its literal terms. 50  The
problem  of  evasion  should  not  be  an  excuse  for  judicial  stretching  of
statutes  (to  be  sure,  a most  ill-defined  concept  in  this  setting),  but the
problem  has  elicited  judicial  responses  in  a  number  of  areas,  most
notably  taxation. 5'

(d)  Delegation, Gaps, and Implementing Rules. - The incomplete-
ness  of textualism  is  most  conspicuous  when  Congress  has  explicitly
or  implicitly  delegated  lawmaking  power  to  the  courts  or when  Con-
gress  has  simply left  a gap.  In  cases  of delegated  power  or  gap-filing,
the  problem  is  not that  words  are  susceptible  to  more  than  one  con-
struction,  but instead  that  the  words  necessarily  require  courts  to look
to  sources  outside  of  the  text.5 2

The  Sherman  Act,  for  example,  raises  a  serious  gap-filling  prob-
lem.  The  language  of the  Act  does  not  answer  the  question  of  what
practices  amount to  "conspiracies  in restraint of trade."  The legislative
history  is  suggestive  but  unclear,5 3  and  the  courts  have  inevitably
taken  the  Act  as  a delegation  of policymaking  power  pursuant to  quite
open-ended  criteria.5 4  Similarly,  section  I983 s5 
is  silent  on  many  im-

50  See,  e.g.,  Helvering  v.  Gregory,  69  F.2d  8o9  (2d  Cir.  1934),  aff'd,  293  U.S.  465  (x935).
S  See,  e.g.,  Commissioner  v.  Court  Holding  Co.,  324  U.S.  331  (i945);  Goldstein  v.  Com-
missioner,  364  F.2d  734  (2d Cir.  I966);  Helvering v.  Gregory, 69  F.2d 809.  Outside  the  area  of
taxation,  there  are  many  examples  as  well.  See,  e.g.,  cases  cited  supra note  49;  Stoner  v.
Hudgins,  568  S.W.2d  898,  902-03  (Tex.  Civ.  App.  1978)  (holding that despite  a  narrow  verbal
construction,  a  statute  providing  for  credit  against  damages  for  advance  payments  made  to  tort
claimants  should  be  read  to  mean  that  the credit  should be  applied  after the damage  award  is
reduced  to  account for  comparative  negligence).  See generally Isenbergh,  Musings on Form and
Substance in  Taxation (Book  Review),  49  U.  CHI.  L.  REv.  859  (1982).  Johnson  v.  Southern
Pac.  Co.,  1I7  F. 462  (8th Cir.  1902),  rev'd,  296  U.S.  i  (29o4),  which  held  that  the term  "cars"
in  a  statute  requiring  cars  on  common  carriers  to  be  equipped  with  automatic  couplers  did  not
extend  to  locomotive  engines,  is  persuasively  criticized  by  Hart and  Sacks  on  the  ground  that
the  literalist  court  interpreted  the  statute  too  narrowly.  See  H.  HART  & A.  SACKS,  supra note
15,  at  1173-74.

52  The  problems  of delegation  or gap-filling  must  be  distinguished  from  a  "gap" that  is  best
taken  as  a  legislative  decision  not  to  prohibit  conduct  or  not  to  change  the  status  quo.  Here
silence  is  a  straightforward  absence  of  law,  and  one  that  allows  private  coilduct  to  go  on  as
before.  This latter  sort of gap  - which  is  essentially an  exclusion  or exemption  from  a  statute
-
is  confused  with  the  sort of gap  that requires  judicial  elaboration  of the  law  in  Easterbrook,
cited  above  in  note  i3;  and  OFFICE  OF  LEGAL  POLICY,  U.S.  DEP'T  OF  JUSTICE,  USING  AND

IN  STATUTORY  INTERPRETATION  100-04  (1989)  [hereinafter  USING  AND  MISUSING  LEGISLATIVE
HISTORY].  The  confusion  produces  a  version  of  the  old  idea  that statutes  in  derogation  of  the
common  law must  be  narrowly  construed.

portant  questions,  including  available  defenses,  burdens  of  pleading
and  persuasion,  and  exhaustion  requirements.  Because  of the  textual
silence,  judges  must fill  the  gaps.  To this  extent,  the  statute  delegates
power  to  make  common  law. 56

Judicial  implementation  of  title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of
I96457  can  be  understood  in  similar  terms,  though  this  example  is
more  controversial.  The  basic  prohibition of "discrimination" provides
no  guidance  on  the  role  of  discriminatory  effects, 
the  appropriate
burdens  of proof and  production,  and  the  mechanisms  for  filtering  out
discriminatory  treatment.  Judicial  answers  to  these  questions  some-
times  purport  to  be  relatively  mechanical  responses  to  congressional
commands,5 8  but  in  fact  they  amount  to  judge-made  implementing
devices  that  reflect the  judges'  own,  inevitably  value-laden  views.  In
light of the  existence  of textual gaps  on  many  questions,  this  approach
is  hardly  an  embarrassment  or a usurpation,  but instead  an  inevitable
part of interpretation.  Much  of the  law  of title VII  is  an  unavoidable,
and therefore  legitimate,  norm-ridden  exercise  in  developing  gap-filling
rules.5 9  In  this  respect,  the  Sherman  Act  and  title  VII  are  closely
analogous.

When  the  language  of  a statute  does  not  specify  its  implementing
rules,  textualism  is  incomplete:  courts  must  look  elsewhere.  When
Congress  has  delegated  power  or  left  a  gap,  the  line  between  inter-
preting  and  creating  federal  common  law60  becomes  quite  thin.

(e)  Changed  Circumstances. -

The  discussion  thus  far  has  as-
sumed  that  circumstances  have  not  changed  significantly  since  the
statute  was  enacted.  Textualism  becomes  even  more  problematic

56  The  C6urt  has sometimes  indicated  that gaps  should  be filled  by  reference  to  the common
law  of  the  time.  See,  e.g.,  City  of Newport  v.  Fact  Concerts,  Inc.,  453  U.S.  247,  258  (ig8i);
Wood  v.  Strickland,  420  U.S.  308,  318  (I975).  Frequently,  however,  it  has  filled  gaps  in
accordance  with  its  own  views about  how best  to implement  the  statute -
an  approach  that  is
probably  consistent  with  the  drafters'  own  understanding  about  how  courts  would  act.  See

intervenors,  largely  because  of courts'  perceptions  about  the social  consequences  of  such  a rule).
60  Federal  common  law  is  usually  thought  to  involve  judicial  lawmaking  when  little  or  no
guidance  has  been  supplied  by  the  legislature.  See  Friendly,  In Praise of Erie  - And  of the
New  Federal Common Law,  39  N.Y.U.  L.  REV.  383,  410-1I  (2964).  Statutory  interpretation,
by contrast,  is usually  thought to involve  a decision about the meaning of ambiguous  enactments.
For  the  reasons  stated  in the  text,  this distinction  is  far  too  simple.

INTERPRETING STATUTES

when  time  has  affected  the  assumptions  under  which  the  statute  was
originally written.  Changed  circumstances  may produce  ambiguity  or
interpretive  doubt  in  the  text  where  neither  existed  before.

Consider  the  Delaney  Clause,  which  forbids  the  use  as  food  ad-
ditives  of substances  that  "induce" cancer. 61  The Delaney  Clause  was
enacted  at a time when  carcinogenic  substances  were  difficult to  detect
and  all  detectable  carcinogens  were extremely  dangerous.  These  facts,
however,  no  longer  hold  true,  and  under  current  conditions  the  De-
laney  Clause  almost  undoubtedly  increases  health  risks  by  keeping
relatively  safe  substances  off  the  market  and  by forcing  consumers  to
resort  either  to  noncarcinogenic  substances  that pose  other  risks  or  to
substances  that  were  approved  by  earlier  administrators  using  the
cruder  technology  of  their  day.  Because  the  factual  premises  under
which  the  enacting  Congress  operated  are  now  demonstrably  false,
might  the  word  "induce"  allow  the  government  to  exempt  from  reg-
ulation  carcinogens  that  pose  trivial  risks? 62  Similarly,  would  a "pub-
lic  policy"  exception  to  the  charitable  deduction  in  the  Internal  Rev-
enue  Code  require  the  government  to  deny  the  deduction  to  schools
that  engage  in  racial  discrimination,  even  if  those  who  enacted  the
Code  many  decades  before  believed  that  such  discrimination  was
perfectly  consistent  with  public  policy?63  In  short,  it  is  by  no  means
obvious  that  the  statutory  text  should  be  understood  in  accordance
with its "original  meaning,"  even if that concept  were unproblematic. 64

The  discussion  thus  far  suggests  two  principal  points.  First,  and
most  fundamentally,  there  is  no  such  thing  as  an  acontextual  "text"
that  can  be  used  as  the  exclusive  guide  to  interpretation.  In  easy
cases,  interpretive  norms  -
on  which  there  is  wide  or  universal
consensus -
and  context  both  play  a part in  the  process  of ascertain-
ing  statutory  meaning.  Because  such  norms  are  so  widely  shared,
they  are  invisible  and  are  not an  object  of controversy.  Only  in  these
cases  can  meaning  ever  be  said  to  be  "plain."  With  these  qualifica-
tions,  textualism  is  generally  appropriate.  In  hard  cases,  however,
courts  must  resort  to  a  highly  visible  background  norm, 65  or  a  con-

61  See  21  U.S.C.  §  348(c)(3)(A)  (1982).
62  See  infra pp.  496-97.
63  See infra note  ioo (discussing  Bob Jones University  v.  United-States,  461  U.S.  574  (I983)).
64  Indeed,  I  will  be  offering  reasons  to  suggest that  it should  not, be.  See  infra  pp.  493-97;

accord Aleinikoff,  Updating Statutory Interpretation, 87  MICH.  L.  REV.  20  (1988).

65  In  hard  cases,  a  claimed  reliance  on  the  text  often  disguises  the actual  basis  for decision,
which  does  not  turn  on  text  at  all.  In  these  cases,  discretion  is  inevitable.  For  a  powerful
demonstration  in  the  context  of  environmental  law,  see  R.  MELNiCK,  REGULATION  AND  THE
COURTS:  THE  CASE  OF  THE  CLEAN  AIR  ACT  371  (2983),  which  shows  that  the constant  resort
to  statutory  text  in  cases  in  which  text  is  at  best  indeterminate  can  lead  judges  to  act  on  the
basis  of  unarticulated  and  uninformed  policy  considerations.

testable  one,  or some  gap-filling  device  in  order  to  resolve  an  interpre-
tive  dispute.  In  these  settings,  and  in  this  sense,  textualism  is  incom-
plete.

Second,  it  is  by  no  means  obvious  that  courts  should  always  rely
solely  on  the  text  or on  the  "plain  meaning"  of its  words  even  in  cases
in  which  such  reliance  leads  to  determinate  results.  Although  tex-
tualism  properly  draws  on  the  democratic  primacy  of the  legislature,
legislative  instructions  are  often  unclear  and  the  claim  of  a command
is  a  myth.  An  interpretive  strategy  that  relies  exclusively  on  the
ordinary  meaning  of words  is  precisely  that -
a strategy  that reflects
a  choice  among  competing  possibilities  -
and  it  will  sometimes  pro-
duce  irrationality  or  injustice  that  the  legislature  did  not  intend. 6 6
Textualism  of this  sort  is  not incomplete  but  instead  pernicious.

In  cases  of overinclusiveness,  underinclusiveness,  changed  circum-
stances,  or  divergence  between  ordinary  meaning  and  contextual  or
legislatively  intended  meaning,  textualism  - with  its  disregard  of the
irrational,  unjust,  and  often  unintended  outcomes  produced  by  liter-
alism  in  hard cases -
is best  defended  as  a fighting faith,  an inference
from  the  system  of  separation  of  powers,  rather  than  as  a  necessary
understanding  of  statutory  interpretation.  On  this  view,  reliance  on
ordinary  meaning  and  indifference  to  context,  irrationality,  and  injus-
tice  will  discipline  the  judges,  limit  their  discretion,  hold  them  to
Congress'  actual  words,  and  warn  the  lawmakers  to  be  careful  about
statutory  language.67  It  is  by  no  means  clear,  however,  that a system
of textualism,  so  defended,  will  lead  to  a superior  system  of law,  and
there  is  considerable  reason  to  suspect  otherwise. 68  Even  the  most
attractive  form of textualism,  emphasizing  not literalism but the  mean-
ing  of words  read  in  context  and  against  shared  interpretive  norms,
is  inadequate  in  light  of  the  need  to  use  contestable  norms  in  hard
cases  and  the  interpretive  difficulties  produced  by  unintended  irra-
tionality  and  injustice.

2.  Contextual Approaches.  -

Sometimes  those  who  rely  on  the
agency  theory  stress  not  the  statutory  text  alone,  but  text  as  under-
stood  in  the light  of the  context  and  background  of the  statute.  Con-
textual  approaches  provide  at least  partial  responses  to  the  problems
with  textualism,  mostly  by  helping  to  resolve  ambiguities  or  fill  gaps.
The traditional  efforts  to  supplement text with  context,  however,  have

66  Consider,  for instance,  the examples  of overinclusiveness  mentioned  earlier:  a law  allowing
spousal  inheritance  "in  all  circumstances,"  invoked  by  someone  who  murdered  his  wife;  or  a
law  allowing  employers  to  discharge  employees  "for  any  reason"  invoked  by  an  employer  who
fired  a  worker  for  refusing  to commit murder.  See  supra p.  42o;  see also cases  cited  supra notes
35  & 44.

INTERPRETING STATUTES

problems  of  their  own.  Sometimes  they  reproduce  the  failings  of
textualism,  sometimes  they  operate  at  the  expense  of  the  text,  and
sometimes  they  depend  on  poor  understandings  of  the  legislative  pro-
cess  and  the  constitutional  background.  The  most  prominent  efforts
to  adhere  to  the  agency  theory  while  venturing  beyond  the  text of the
provision  at  issue  involve  structure,  purpose,  intent,  and  legislative
history.

(a) Structure. - Courts  often  respond  to  the  various  problems  in
textual  approaches  by  reference  to  other  parts  of the  text  and,  more
importantly  for  our  purposes,  to  the  structure  of  the  statute.  On  this
view,  an  interpretation  should  be  disfavored  if  it  would  make  the
disputed  provision  fit  awkwardly  with  another  provision  or  produce
internal  redundancy  or confusion.  An  interpretation  that would  make
sense  of  the  statute  as  a  whole  should  be  adopted.  Structural  argu-
ment  has  proved  helpful  in  many  cases. 69

Structural  approaches  to  statutory  construction  are  entirely  unob-
jectionable  -
on  the  contrary,  they  provide  significant  interpretive
guidance.  Such  approaches  promote  fidelity  to  congressional  instruc-
tions  and  at the  same  time  help  to  make  sense  of complex  regulatory
enactments. 
If  an  interpretation  of  one  provision  works  against  or
makes  meaningless  another  provision,  there  is  good  reason  to  reject
that  interpretation.

Structural  approaches,  however,  suffer  from  two  problems.  First,
they  depend  on  an  assumption  that  statutes  are  in  fact  internally
consistent  and  coherent  -
an  assumption  that  recent  theories  of  leg-
islation  have  questioned  in  light  of  the  influence  of  interest  groups,
compromise,  and  irrationality. 70  If that assumption  is false,  the court's
treatment  of statutes  as  internally  consistent wholes  cannot  be justified

69 See,  e.g.,  Carlucci  v.  Doe,  1o9  S.  Ct. 407,  412-14  (1988);  Milwaukee  v.  Yeutter, 877  F.2d
540,  544  (7th  Cir.  1989).  Community for  Creative  Non-Violence  v.  Reid,  109  S.  Ct.  2166  (1989)
is  an  instructive  example.  In  Reid,  the  Supreme  Court  was  asked  to  construe  the  "work-for-
hire"  provision  of the  Copyright  Act  of  1976,  17  U.S.C.  §  201(b)  (1982).  Section  2oi  entities  an
artist  to  the  copyright  of  her  work  unless  the  work  was  "made  for  hire."  In  §  1i,  work  for
hire is  defined  in two provisions:  under the first definition,  it is  "a work  prepared by an  employee
within  the  scope  of  his  or  her  employment";  under  the  second  definition,  "a  work  specially
ordered  or  commissioned  for  use  as  a  contribution  to  a  collective  work"  or  under  any  of  eight
other  enumerated  categories.  See  17  U.S.C.  §  io 

(1982).

The  Court  considered  the  claim  that  when  the  buyer  retains  the  right  to  control  the  work,
the  artist  is  a  common  law  employee  under  the  first  definition  of work  for  hire.  The  Court
rejected  this  claim  because  it  would  make  the  exceptions  to  the  second  definition  superfluous:
Congress  could  not  have  intended  a  right-to-control  test  for  employment  because  that  "would
mean  that  many  works  that  could  satisfy  §  101(2)  would  already  have  been  deemed  works  for
hire  under  §  ioi(i)."  Reid,  iog  S.  Ct.  at  2173.

Treatment of Racial Minorities, 1974  SuP.  CT.  REv.  i,  27-31;  Stigler,  The  Theory of Economic
Regulation, 2  BELL  J.  ECON.  & MGMT.  SC.  3  (1971).

as  an  accurate  way  of  implementing  legislative  instructions.  If  the
concern  with  promoting  rationality  is  to  be  supported,  it  must  be  on
independent  grounds. 7 1  Second,  structural  approaches  offer  only par-
tial  help. 
In  many  cases,  an  examination  of  structure  will  reveal
ambiguities,  silences,  or  delegations. 72  In  the  hardest  cases,  the  char-
acterization  of  structure  depends  largely,  not  on  structure  itself,  but
on  a  value-laden  idea  about  what  conception  of  the  statute  works
best. 73  To  resolve  these  problems,  it will  be  necessary  to  look  else-
where.

(b)  Purpose,  Intent,  and  History.  -

In  addition  to  consulting
statutory  structure,  a  natural  and  time-honored  response  to  the  prob-
lems  of textualism  has  been  to look  to  the purpose,  intent,  and  history
of a statute.

such  as  reliance  on  text  alone  -

(i) Purpose. - Resort to  the  "purpose" of the statute  was  especially
popular  among  academic  commentators  in  the  195o's  and  I96O's.
Steeped  in  legal  realism,  these  commentators  disparaged  approaches
-
that  substituted  mechanical  rules
for  more  functional  and purposive  inquiries. 74  Their resort to  purpose
was  an  effort  to  maintain  the  role  of  the  courts  as  agents  of  the
legislature  while  at  the  same  time  acknowledging  the  inadequacy  of
textualism.  Thus,  in  the  case  of  the  war  memorial  in  the  park,  the
question  whether  the  memorial  is  a  "vehicle"  within  the  meaning  of
the  statute  might be  answered  by asking  whether the  memorial  creates
harms  (such  as  noise  or  pollution)  that  undermine  the  purposes  for
which  the  statute  was  enacted.  Because  the  memorial  does  not,  the
case  is  an  easy  one,  and  the  statutory  proscription  does  not  apply.

In  some  cases,  then,  reliance  on  purpose  will  be  a  valuable  way
of  providing  a  context  within  which  to  understand  statutory  terms.
Purposive  interpretation  is,  however,  far from  a  complete  solution  to
the  problem  of  statutory  construction,  for  it  reproduces  all  of  the
problems  of  textualism  in  slightly  different  guise.  For  example,  the
purpose  may  be  ambiguous  or  may  reveal  a  gap  or  delegation.  Are
the  antitrust  laws  designed  to  promote  consumer  welfare  in  the  eco-
nomic  sense  or to  protect small  business?  Is  a statute  forbidding racial

71 See  infra pp.  437-41.
72  Cf. United  States  v.  Southwestern  Cable  Co.,  392  U.S.  157,  172-73  (I968)  (holding  that
the  FCC  could  regulate  new  technologies  not  on  the list  of  regulated  activities  enumerated  in
the  Communications  Act  of  1934).

73  The same  criticism  applies  to  the  most well-known  justification  of  structural  analysis,  C.
BLACK,  STRUCTURE  AND  RELATIONSHIP  IN  CONSTITUTIONAL  LAW  (i969).  Black's  characteri-
zation  of the  Constitution's  structural  commitments  generates  a  number  of  controversial  conclu-
sions;  many  of  them  are  not  clearly  supported  by  constitutional  structure  and  rest  instead  on
value-laden  assumptions  of his  own.

and Fidelity to  Law  - A  Reply  to  Professor Hart, 71  HARV.  L.  REv.  63o,  661-69  (x958);  see

discrimination  designed  to  proscribe  all  distinctions  on  the  basis  of
race,  or  only  those  distinctions  that  burden  members  of  minority
groups? 75  Often  the  legislature  itself  will  not  have  anticipated  such
questions.  The  characterization  of  legislative  purpose  is  an  act  of
creation  rather  than  discovery.

All  of  these  problems  would  be  formidable  even  if  the  legislature
consisted  of  one  or  a few  persons.  In  the  face  of multimember  insti-
tutions,  the  problem  becomes  even  more  troublesome.  There  will  be
not  one  but  many  purposes  in  any  statute;  those  purposes  will  some-
times  conflict  with  one  another;  legislators  will  have  complex  and
conflicting  views  on  purposes;  the  purposes  could  be  described  at
different  levels  of  generality;  and  purposes  will  have  been  compro-
mised  and traded  off  in  complex  ways.  A  statute  designed  to  protect
workers  might  also  be  intended  to  help  union  at the  expense  of non-
union  employment;  a  statute  designed  to  protect  the  environment
might  also  be  intended  to  protect  eastern  coal  producers. 76

Purposive  interpretation  may  also  suffer  from  overinclusiveness  or
underinclusiveness.  By taking  the  purpose  of a statute  out  of context,
one  might  broadly  read  a  provision  to  prevent  behavior  that  under
the  most  plausible  reading  the  statute  should  not  reach. 7 7  Similarly,
an  unduly  narrow  categorization  might prevent  a statute  from  reach-
ing  a situation  that  should  fall  within  its  scope. 78  Advocates  of  pur-
posive  interpretation  sometimes  disregard  the  fact  that  purposes  are
expressed  through  and  have  no  life  independent  of  statutory  words.
The words  represent  the  law.

When  circumstances  change,  reliance  on  the  statutory  purpose
becomes  even  trickier.  Assume,  for  example,  that  Congress  enacts  a
statute  imposing  significant  procedural  requirements  on  regulatory
agencies  engaging  in  adjudicative  tasks  but  lenient  requirements  on
agencies  engaging  in  rulemaking,  and  that  Congress  thought  almost
all  important  administrative  business  would  be  done  through  adjudi-
cation.  But thirty years  after  enactment,  those  assumptions  no  longer

75  Cf.  United  Steelworkers  of America  v. Weber,  443  U.S.  193,  200-08  (1979)  (holding  that

title  VII  does  not  forbid  voluntary  affirmative  action  plans).

76  See  B.  ACKERMAN  &  W.  HASSLER,  supra  note  23,  at  26-54.  Those  who  emphasize  the
ambiguity  and  multiplicity  of  statutory  purposes  often  stress  as  well  the  intractability  of the
ideological  disputes  that  sometimes  lie  beneath  interpretive  questions.  See  Easterbrook,  supra
note  13, at  544-51.  Textualism  thus  provides  a  natural  refuge  from  purposive  approaches  -
even  if  the  refuge  itself is  ultimately  doomed.

77  See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.  Turkette,  452  U.S.  576,  588-93  (ig8i)  (interpreting  "enterprise"
in  RICO  to  encompass  both  legitimate  and  illegitimate  enterprises,  even  though  legitimate
enterprises  were  not  within  Congress'  original  contemplation).

78  See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.  Elgin,  J. & E.  Ry.,  298  U.S.  492  (1936)  (finding'no  violation
of  the commodities  clause  of the  Interstate  Commerce  Act where  a railroad  company  owned  by
a  holding  company  transported  the  products  of  the  holding  company's  subsidiary,  even  though
the  transportation  caused  all  of  the  harms  the statute  was  enacted  to  prevent).

hold,  as  agencies  engage  in  extensive  rulemaking  and  do most  of their
significant  work  in  that  way.  Is  it so  clear  that judicial  "bending"  of
ambiguous  provisions  in  the  statute  to  impose  greater  procedural  re-
quirements  in  rulemaking  is  unfaithful  to  the  purpose  of  the  law? 79
Indeed,  is  it  so  clear  that  such  an  interpretation  is  bending  at  all?  In
view  of  the  changed  context,  what  would  it  mean  for  courts  to  be
"faithful" to  the  original  purpose?80

The  problem  in  these  settings  is  that  mechanical  transplantation
of  statutory  purposes  to  new  settings  is  unlikely  to  produce  sensible
results  even  from  the  standpoint  of the  enacting  legislature.  Nor is  it
sufficient  to  say  that  the  legislature  rather  than  the  courts  should
respond  to  changed  circumstances.  Often  it  is  unrealistic  to  expect  a
legislative  response. 8'  More  important,  the  issue  for  interpretation  is
the  meaning  of  the  statute  in  the  new  circumstances.  Meaning  does
not remain  static  across  changes  in  law,  policy,  and  fact. 82  Interpre-
tation  that  brings  the  legislature  into  the  present  will,  however,  in-
evitably  involve  a  large  measure  of  discretion  and  a  corresponding
danger  of judicial  abuse.

Purposive  interpretation,  then,  is  far from  a panacea.  Although  it
is  frequently  helpful  in  giving  context  to  statutory  terms,  the  effort  to
characterize 
legislative  purpose  often  produces  serious  problems,
whether  or  not  circumstances  have  changed.  In  some  cases,  the  pur-
pose  might  be  characterized  in  many  ways,  all  of  which  are  faithful
to  the  original  enactment.  The act  of characterization  is  therefore  one
of invention  rather  than  discovery.

(ii)  Legislative Intent and Legislative History. -

It  is  often  sug-
gested  that  in hard  cases,  the  meaning of the  statute should be  derived
by  ascertaining  the  intent  of  those  who  enacted  it.8 3  This  approach

79  See  Scalia,  Vermont  Yankee:  The APA,  the  D.C.  Circuit, and the  Supreme  Court,  1978

SuP.  CT.  REv.  345,  381-82  (arguing  in favor  of such  judicial  "bending").

80  Or  suppose  Congress  enacted  a  statute  regulating  banking  with  the  understanding  that
the  banking  and  securities  businesses  could  be  quite  discrete  and  that  banks  would  face  little
competition  - but the  rise  of the  money  market  fund  forced  banks  to  compete  in  an  integrated
and  competitive  national  market.  In  such  circumstances,  how  should  the Court  decide  whether
a  bank  holding  company  can  provide  securities  brokerage  services  in  the  face  of  ambiguous
restrictions  on  combining  securities  business  with  banking?  See  Langevoort,  Statutory Obsoles-
cence  and the  Judicial Process: The  Revisionist Role  of the  Courts in  Federal Banking Regu-
lation, 85 MICH.  L.  REv.  672  (1987).

sional Choice  or Reasoned Adaptation to  Scientific  Progress?, 5 YALE  J. ON  REG.  1  (1988)
(noting  Congress'  failure  to  come  to  terms  with  the  obsolescence  of the  Delaney  Clause).

82  This  point  is  insufficiently  emphasized  by  Dean  Calabresi,  who  suggests  that  the  remedy
for  obsolete  statutes  is  "overruling"  them.  See  G.  CALABRESI,  A  COMMON  LAW  FOR  THE  AGE
OF  STATUTES  163-66  (1982).  In  fact,  "obsolescence"  frequently involves  just the  opposite  prob-
lem:  discerning  the  meaning  of  a statute  in  light of  changed  circumstances.

INTERPRETING STATUTES

is  similar  to  purposive  interpretation,  but  here  the  goal  is  not  to  look
at  a  general  legislative  aim  or  purpose,  but  instead  to  see  more  par-
ticularly  how  the  enacting  legislature  would  have  resolved  the  ques-
tion,  or  how  it  intended  that  question  to  be  resolved,  if  it  had  been
presented.  For  those  who  emphasize  legislative  intent,  the  legislative
history  is  a  central  object  of  concern.

In  recent  years,  the  Supreme  Court  has  been  divided  about  the
significance  of  legislative  intent and  legislative  history.  The  Court  has
suggested  that the question  for interpretation  is in  fact one of "congres-
sional  intent,"8 4  and  has  generally  treated  legislative  history  as  a  key
to the  identification  of "intent."  Justice  Scalia,  however,  has  expressed
considerable  doubt  about  legislative  intent  in  general  and  legislative
history in  particular.8 5  In Justice  Scalia's  view,  the  role  of the  courts
is  to  ascertain  statutory  meaning  rather  than  legislative  "intent."
Moreover,  Justice  Scalia  suggests  that  legislative  history  is  frequently
Written  by  well-organized  private  groups,  and  much  of  it,  especially
the  floor  debates,  reflects  little,  if  any,  general  congressional  will.8 6
Judicial  reliance  on  legislative  history  thus  increases  the  power  of
interest groups  over  the  interpretive process  at the  expense  of Congress

43  HARV.  L.  REV.  863,  866  (193o).

Justice  Scalia's  hostility  to  the use  of legislative  history derives  in part from  his  characteristic
but quite extraordinary  antagonism  to  approaches  that increase  complexity in the law.  A  reliance
on  the  text  seems  to  have  the  comparative  virtue  of  simplicity.  For  illustrations  of Justice
Scalia's  hostility  to  complexity  in  a  range  of  areas,  see  Mistretta  v.  United  States,  xog  S.  Ct.
647,  675  (1989)  (Scalia,  J.,  dissenting)  (criticizing  the  Court  in  part  because  of  the  complex
character  of  the  balancing  test  it  adopts);  Morrison  v.  Olson,  1o8  S.  Ct.  2597,  2622-41  (1988)

judgment)  (calling  for  a  bright-line  rule  against implied  causes  of  action);  and  Agency  Holding
Corp.  v. Malley-Duff & Assocs.,  483  U.S.  143,  170  (1987) (Scalia, J.,  concurring  in the judgment)
(calling  for  the  use  of  the  state  statute  of  limitations  or  no  limitations  period  at  all  when  the
federal  statute  lacks  an  explicit  limitations  period).

86  As  a  self-conscious  example,  consider  these  words:
Mr.  Speaker,  having received unanimous  consent  to  extend  my remarks  in the RECORD,
I  would  like  to  indicate  that  I  am not  really speaking  these  words.  .
. . As  a matter  of
fact,  I  am back  in  my office  typing  this out  on  my  own  hot little  typewriter..  . . Such
is  the  pretense  of  the  House  that  it  would  have  been  easy  to  just  quietly  include  these
remarks  in the RECORD,  issue  a  brave press  release,  and convince  thousands of  cheering
constituents  that  I was  in there  fighting  every  step  of  the way,  influencing  the  course  of
history  in  the heat  of  debate.

itself.  Above  all,  Justice  Scalia  argues,  the  legislative  history  was
never  enacted  and  is  therefore  not  law.8 7

Concerns  of this sort  are  both legitimate  and  well-taken.  Although
it  is  proper  to  look  at  a statute's  background  in  the  form  of  actually
enacted  and  repealed  provisions,  the  legislative  history,  which  was
never  enacted,  should  rarely  be  permitted  to  supplant  the  statutory
words as  they  are ordinarily  understood.8 8  This is  so because  attention
to  the  language  promotes  the  rule  of  law  and  because  of  democratic
and  constitutional  considerations  -
the  words  rather  than  the  intent
survived  the  procedures  of  article  I.  Moreover,  such  an  approach
might  both  discipline  Congress,  by  forcing  it  to  attend  to  its  words,
and  minimize  judicial  discretion  by  barring  judges  from  relying  on
policies  and  principles  of  their  own.  But  Justice  Scalia  somewhat
overstates  the  point.8 9  The  legislative  history  will  sometimes  reveal
what  some  or  many  members  of  the  Congress  thought  about  the
meaning  of  an  ambiguous  term,  and  that  understanding  is  relevant.
It  is  unlikely  that  the  history  will  only  reflect  the  views  of  self-
interested  private  groups. 90  Moreover,  legislative  history  provides  a
sense  of  the  context  and  purpose  of  a statutory  enactment,  which,  as
we  have  seen,  can  provide  important  interpretive  help.

Finally,  and  most  fundamentally,  it  is  not  clear  where  judges  are
to  look  if  they  refuse  to  consider  the  legislative  history.  Without
reference  to  the  history,  interpretation  sometimes  becomes  far  less
bounded, 9 1  and  it  is  no  surprise  that  those  who  reject  intent  and
history  tend  to  be  textualists 92  -
a  strategy  that  in  hard  cases  will

90  See  Farber  & Frickey, supra note  23,  at 445-46  (suggesting that  legislative  history  is  more
likely  to  reflect  the  views  of congressional  staff members  than  those  of  private  interest  groups).
It  is  also  possible  to  create  a  hierarchy  within  the  sources  of  legislative  history.  Thus,  for
example,  floor  debates,  which  are  often  conducted  before  few  legislators  and  sometimes  are
added  after  the  fact,  are  entitled  to  less  weight  than  a  committee  report.  See  Eskridge,  The
New  Textualism,  37  U.C.L.A.  L.  REv.  (forthcoming  iggo).

91  The  combination  of textualism,  disregard  of legislative  history, and the  Chevron principle,
see infra pp.  444-46,  would  produce  a  dramatic  increase  in  the executive's  power  to  make  law.
When the language  is  ambiguous,  the executive's  interpretation  will  control,  even  if the legislative
history argues  in  the  other direction.  Consider  in  this regard Justice  Scalia's  general  enthusiasm
for  executive  power.  See  Mistretta v.  United  States,  o9  S.  Ct.  647,  68o-83  (989)

dissenting);  Morrison  v.  Olson,  io8  S.  Ct.  2597,  2622-41  (1988)  (Scalia,  J.,  dissenting).

INTERPRETING STATUTES

leave  large  gaps  or  produce  mistakes.  One  might  say  all  this  without
denying  that  Justice  Scalia  is  saying  something  correct  and  important
in  cautioning  courts  not to  accord  weight  to  legislative  history  at  the
expense  of  statutory  language,  and  in  recognizing  the  risk  that  parts
of the  history  may  have  been  composed  by one  side  or  the  other.  In
short,  courts  should  approach  legislative  history  cautiously. 93  Except
in  rare  cases  of  unintended  irrationality  or  injustice, 94  courts  should
not  permit  history  to  overcome  statutory  language;  but  they  should
also  not ignore  it,  especially  when  the  text  is  unclear.

For  present  purposes,  the  more  fundamental  point  is  that judicial
reliance  on  legislative  intent,  whether  or  not  derived  on  the  basis  of
legislative  history,  suffers  from  three  basic  difficulties.  The  first  is
that  Congress  enacts  statutes  rather  than  its  own  views  about  what
those  statutes  mean;  those  views,  while  relevant,  are  not  controlling
unless  they  are  in  the  statute.  The  words,  not  the "intent,"  represent
the  law.  The  enactment,  not the  legislature's  unenacted  views,  binds
the  public  and  the  judges. 95

To  say this  is  not to  deny  that the  intentions  of a  group  or  majority
of  lawmakers  will  be  pertinent  and  helpful.  Legislative  history  has
in  fact  provided  a  valuable  sense  of  context  in  a  number  of  recent
cases.96  If  the  legislators  understood  a  statutory  word  as  a  term  of

legislative  history);  Scalia,  Judicial Deference  to Administrative Interpretations of Law,  1989

agency's  greater expertise  and accountability).  Justice  Scalia has,  notably,  endorsed  some  canons
of  construction.  See,  e.g.,  Green  v.  Bock  Laundry  Mach.  Co.,  1O9 S.  Ct. i98i, 1994  (1989)
(Scalia, J.,  concurring  in  the judgment) (advocating  an  interpretation  "most compatible  with  the

93  For a vivid  illustration  of why courts  ought to do  this,  see  B.  ACKERMAN  & W.  HASSLER,

legislation).

rather  than  intended  meaning,  see  USING  AND  MISUSING  LEGISLATIVE  HISTORY,  supra  note
52,  at 21-26.  The  argument, however,  understates  the usefulness of intended  meaning in clearing
up  ambiguities,  correcting  unintended  absurdities,  and  avoiding  irrationality.

In  Bock,  iog  S.  Ct.  1981,  for  example,  all the  members  of  the  Court  refused  to  read  the
relevant  text  literally,  and  all agreed  that  the legislative  history  helped  to  reveal  that  literalism

art,  that  understanding  should  prevail;  courts  should  attend  to  the
intended  meaning  rather  than  the  usual  meaning  of the  words  if  the
former  is  clear  and  the latter  would  produce  absurdity.  Moreover,  an
undisputed  congressional  intent  should  ordinarily  be  followed  in  the
event  of linguistic  ambiguity. 97  But  the  subjective  intentions,  even  if
ascertainable,  are  not controlling  unless  enacted. 98

would  lead  to  inadvertent  absurdity.  The  case  involved  the  meaning  of  rule  6og(a)(x)  of  the
Federal  Rules  of  Evidence,  which  allows  the  introduction  of  prior  crimes  of  a  witness,  for
purposes  of attacking credibility,  when  "the probative  value  of admitting this  evidence  outweighs
its  prejudicial  effect to  the defendant."  FED.  R.  EVID.  6o9(a)(1).  All  nine  members  of the  Court
agreed  that  rule  6og  could  not plausibly  mean  that  evidence  would  be  automatically  introduced
against  civil  plaintiffs,  but  not  against  civil  defendants.  The  legislative  history  revealed  that
such  an  interpretation  was  unintended  -
for  no  one,  at  any  point  in  the  background  and
history  of the  rules,  ever proposed  or  assumed  a distinction  between  the rights  of  civil  plaintiffs
and  those  of civil defendants.  Indeed,  even  Justice  Scalia acknowledged  the  usefulness  of history
here:  "I  think  it entirely appropriate  to  consult  all  public  materials,  including  ... 
the  legislative
history...  to verify that what seems  to us  an unthinkable  disposition...  was indeed  unthought
of,  and  thus  to justify  a  departure  from  the  ordinary  meaning  of  the  word  'defendant'  in  the
Rule."  Bock,  io9 S.  Ct.  at  1994  (Scalia,  J.,  concurring  in  the judgment).

Legislative  history  can  also  help  the courts  to  avoid  irrationality  while  vindicating  congres-
sional  will  in the  face  of ambiguity.  In  Public  Citizen  v.  United  States  Department  of Justice,
109  S. Ct.  2558 (1989), the  Court  faced  the question  whether  the  Federal  Advisory  Committee
Act,  5  U.S.C.  App.  §§  i-IS  (1982  & Supp.  V),  which  imposes detailed  requirements  for openness,
publicity,  and balance in membership  of federal advisory  committees,  applied  to  the consultations
of  the  American  Bar  Association's  Standing  Committee  on  Federal Judiciary.  That  committee
consults  with  the  President  regarding  potential  nominees  for  federal  judgeships.  The  Court
acknowledged  that  the  Act's  language,  which  defined  an  advisory  committee  as  one  "utilized
by"  the Executive,  appeared  to  apply to  the ABA  committee.  But  use  of a  dictionary  definition
of "utilize"  would  be  absurd  because  it would  make  the  Act  apply  even  to  presidential  decisions
to  consult with  his  own  political  party  before  selecting his  Cabinet.  The  Court instead  examined
the  legislative  history, which  strongly suggested  that the ABA  committee -
a  private  group  not
established  by the  federal  government  and  not  receiving  federal  funds -
did not  fall  within  the
category  of advisory  entities  that  Congress  wanted  to  control.  See  Public Citizen,  O9  S. Ct.
at  2567-73.  See  also Immigration  & Naturalization  Serv.  v.  Cardoza-Fonseca,  480  U.S.  421,
432-43  (1987)  (finding that  asylum  could  be granted  to  aliens  reasonably  fearing persecution,  in
part  because  the legislative history  demonstrated  that Congress  did not  intend a  more demanding
standard).

97 The  intent should  also  control  in the  event  of inadvertent  error.  For  an  example,  see  the
inadvertent  insertion  of  the  word  "not"  in  a  bill  revising  the  boundaries  of  the  Olympic  Park
and  the  Olympic  National  Forest.  The  statute  says  that  the  Secretary  of  Agriculture  must
design  and  construct  a  forest  logging  road,  but  also  provides  that  the  Secretary  "shall  not
construct  the  road  as  close  as  practically  possible  to  the  park  boundary  but not  more  than  five
hundred  feet  east  of  the  divide."  Pub.  L.  No.  99-635,  §  2(a),  ioo  Stat.  3527,  3528  (1986)
(emphasis  added).

98 See  R.  DwoKXIN,  supra note  ig,  at  313-54.  Dworkin  rejects  the  use  of  subjective
intention  to  resolve  ambiguities  in  favor  of a  principle  that would  call  on  courts  to  use "the  best
principle" that justifies  "what the legislature has  done."  This position  is  discussed  in  more  detail
at  p.  436  below.  For  present  purposes,  it  is  sufficient  to  say  that  Dworkin  almost  entirely
ignores  the  risks  of judicial  error,  venality,  or  confusion  in  generating  "the  best  principle";  in
light  of those  risks,  presumptive  reliance  on  subjective  intentions  in  the  face  of ambiguity  or
irrationality  seems  desirable  from  the standpoint  of democratic  theory.

INTERPRETING STATUTES

The second  set  of problems  is  that legislative  intent,  like  legislative
purpose,  is  largely  a fiction  in  hard  cases  -
a problem  aggravated  by
the  extraordinary  difficulties  of aggregating  the  "intentions"  of a  mul-
timember  body.  With  or  without  these  problems,  there  are  risks  of
ambiguity,  overinclusiveness,  and  underinclusiveness 
in  relying  on
legislative  intent,  just  as  there  are  in  relying  on  text  and  purpose.

The  third  problem  is  that  Congress  may  have  enacted  a  concept
capable  of change  over  time.  Those  who  emphasize  legislative  intent
sometimes  say  that  interpreters  should  attempt  to  "go  back"  to  the
beliefs  and hopes  of the enacting legislature  to see  how it would  decide
the  question  had  it  been  presented. 99  It  is  unclear  that  this  "imagi-
native  reconstruction"  approach  is  either  consistent  with  Congress'
interpretive  instructions  or a sensible  way  of ascertaining  the  meaning
of statutory  terms.  In  the  face  of changed  circumstances,  perhaps  the
better  route  would  be  to  imagine  that  the  enacting  legislature  could
be  "brought  forward"  into  the  present  and  then  to  ask  how  it  would
decide  the  question  in  light  of  new  developments  of  law,  fact,  and
policy. 100

99  This  was  Learned  Hand's view.  See  Borrella  v.  Borden  Co.,  I45  F.2d  63,  64  (2d.  Cir.
1944),  aff'd, 325  U.S.  679  (I945);  L. HAND,  How Far Is a Judge Free in Rendering a Decision?,
in  THE  SPIRIT  OF  LIBERTY  IO6-o9  (I.  Dilliard  3 d  ed.  i96o).  Judge  Posner  recently  suggested:
"The judge's  job is  not to keep  a statute up  to date  in the sense  of making it reflect contemporary
values,  but  to  imagine  as  best  he  can  how  the  legislators  who  enacted  the statute  would  have
wanted  it  applied  to  situations  they  did  not  foresee."  R.  POSNER,  stpra note  io,  at  287;  see
generally id.  at  286-93.

This  approach  suffers  from  three  difficulties  in  addition  to  those  identified  in  the text.  First,
in  hard  cases,  this  advice  is  open-ended,  and  perhaps  contradictory.  The  legislature  may have
intended  that  the  statute  not  contradict  contemporary  values  when  applied  to  unforeseen  situ-
ations.  Second,  an  entirely  backward-looking  approach  of  this  sort  may  lead  to  a  less  sensible
system  of  law  than  would  alternative  approaches,  because  it  would  perpetuate  anachronistic
views.  Finally,  background  norms  of  interpretation  play an  inevitable  part  in  the process,  and
those  norms  cannot  readily be  captured  in  the notion  of imaginative  reconstruction.

100  As  Justice  Holmes  commented:
[W]hen  we  are  dealing  with  words- that  also  are  a  constituent  act,  like the  Constitution
of the  United  States,  we  must  realize  that  they  have  called  into  life  a  being  the  devel-
opment  of  which  could  not  have  been  foreseen  completely  by  the  most  gifted  of  its
begetters....  The  case before  us must be considered  in the light of our whole experience,
and  not  merely  in  that of what  was  said  a  hundred  years  ago.

Missouri  v.  Holland,  252  U.S.  416,  433  (1920).

There  is  a  significant  difference  between  backward-looking  and  forward-looking  interpreta-
tion.  Consider,  for  example,  Bob  Jones  University  v.  United  States,  461  U.S.  574  (1983),  in
which  the  Court  was  asked  to  decide  whether  a  public  policy  exception  to  the  charitable
deduction  required  the Internal  Revenue  Service  to  deny  tax  deductions  to schools  that  discrim-
inated  on  the basis of  race.  There  is  no  doubt that if that question  had been  put to the Congress
that initially  enacted  the  relevant provision  of the  Code,  it would  have  answered  that  there was
no  such  requirement.  But  if the  enacting  Congress  were  brought  forward  to  the  present -
to
be  sure,  a  difficult  conceptual  exercise  -
it would  probably  have  concluded  that  the deduction
was  impermissible  in  light  of  its  inconsistency  with  recent  law  and  policy  proscribing  and
penalizing  private  racial  discrimination.

HARVARD  LAW  REVIEW

[Vol.  103:405

When  circumstances  have  changed,  backward-looking  interpreta-
tion  may  produce  absurd  results,  and  often  it  is  fully  plausible  to
think  that  members  of  the  enacting  legislature  intended  the  meaning
of  the  statute  not  to  be  controlled  by  its  original  understanding.  In
such  cases  -
signaled  most  obviously  by  open-ended  terms  capable
of  change  over  time  -
it  should  be  relatively  uncontroversial  for
courts  to  depart from  original  meaning;  here  meaning  obviously  shifts
with  circumstances.  More  generally,  the  legislature  will  often  have
had  no  considered  view  on  the  question  of  backward-looking  or  for-
ward-looking  interpretation.  In  these  circumstances,  reliance  on  intent
will  lead  to  intractable  problems.  Something  other  than  intent  must
be  the  basis  for  decision. 1' 1

For  all  of  these  reasons,  the  notion  of  legislative  intent  is  at  best
an  incomplete  guide  to  statutory  construction.  If the  legislative  intent
is  ascertainable,  it should  be  used  to  resolve  otherwise  doubtful  ques-
tions  about  statutory  meaning.  Nevertheless,  difficult  questions  will
often  remain.

In  sum,  the  traditional  contextual  approaches  can  help  remedy
some  of  the  problems  with  reliance  on  text  "alone."  But  sometimes
structure,  purpose,  intent,  and  history  will  leave  gaps  or ambiguities,
and  reliance  on  purpose,  intent,  and  history  may  lead  to  interpretive
mistakes.  Although  it  would  be  foolish  to  dispense  with  these  tools,
they  cannot  generate  a  workable  approach  to  interpretation  without
considerable  supplementation.

3.  Legal  Process. -

Some  of  those  who  stress  the  importance  of
background  and  context  acknowledge  that  in  some  cases,  a  reliance
on  these  sources  will  be  inadequate.  Thus  the  celebrated  treatment
by Hart  and  Sacks  in  The Legal Process0 2  suggests  that to  solve  hard
cases,  the  court  "should  assume,  unless  the  contrary  unmistakably
appears,  that  the  legislature  was  made  up  of reasonable  persons  pur-
suing  reasonable  purposes  reasonably."'01 3  In  a  similar  vein,  Karl
Llewellyn  counseled  courts  to  "strive  to  make  sense  as  a whole  out  of
our  law  as  a whole.' 0 4

Legal  process  approaches  stand  poised  somewhere  between  agency
theories  of the  judicial  role  and  understandings  of  an  altogether  dif-

INTERPRETING STATUTES

ferent  sort.  On the  one hand,  some  such  approaches  (particularly that
of  Hart  and  Sacks)  are  designed  to  implement  legislative  commands
by  counseling  courts  to  replicate  the  judgment  the  legislature  would
have  made. ' 0 5  On  the  other hand,  some  such approaches  are  designed
to  produce  "reason"  or  "rationality"  in  statutes,  quite  apart  from  any
actual  or  hypothetical  judgment  by  the  legislature. ' 0 6  In  either  case,
the  legal  process  reference  to  "reasonableness"  or  "sense"  points  to  the
context  of  the  statute's  application  rather  than  to  its  background  and
development.

For  those  who  endorse  the  agency  model,  the  first  problem  with
such  approaches  is  that  they  appear  to  be  based  on  poor  understand-
ings  of the  actual  nature  of the  legislative  process. ' 0 7  Hart  and  Sacks,
for  example,  dealt  inadequately  with  the  role  of  interest  groups  in
determining  the  content  of  statutes  -
an  unsurprising  omission  in
light  of  the  fact  that  most  of  the  relevant  literature  has  emerged  in
the  last  generation.  The  view  that  courts  should  treat  statutes  as  if
they  promoted  reasonable  purposes  in  a  reasonable  way  is  an  attrac-
tive  one  -
indeed,  it  plays  a  central  role  in  this  Article.  But  this
claim  is  normative,  not  descriptive.  The  task  of  imposing  reason  on
regulatory  legislation  is  sometimes  inconsistent  with  the  legislation
itself,  and  it  takes  courts  far  from  the  role  of  faithful  agents  of  the
legislature.

More  fundamentally,  the  suggestion  that  courts  should  attempt  to
"make  sense"  of regulatory  statutes  or  to  treat them  as  would  "reason-
able  people  acting  reasonably"  is  a  conspicuous  outgrowth  of  1950's
jurisprudence,  when  the  "end  of  ideology"  thesis  played  such  a  large
role  in  political  science  and  the  study  of law.' 0 8  Advice  of  this  sort
is  useful  only  when  there  is  a  consensus  or  a  defense  of particularized
judgments  about  what  approach  "makes  sense"  or  is  "reasonable."  In
many  interpretive  disputes,  however,  such  guidance  is  too  open-ended
to  be  helpful.  Without  much  more,  a  reference  to  "sense"  cannot
determine  whether  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Act  (OSHA)
requires  the  agency  to  undertake  cost-benefit  analyses,  or  whether  the
Civil  Rights  Act of  1964  outlaws  race-conscious  programs  designed  to
increase  the  representation  of  blacks.  A  recognition  of  this  point  has

strategy.

an  understandable  but  unsuccessful

The  same  problems  underlie  Ronald  Dworkin's  influential  treat-
ment  of  this  subject.' 0 9  Dworkin  argues  that  courts  should  interpret
statutes  in  accordance  with  the  best  principle  that  can  be  brought
forward  in  support  of what  the  legislature  "has  done."  In  Dworkin's
view,  the judge  should see  himself  as "a partner  continuing  to develop,
in  what  he  believes  is  the  best  way,  the  statutory  scheme  Congress
began. " 110  The  judge  should  ask  "what  coherent  system  of political
convictions  would  best justify  what [the  legislature]  has  done," 111  and
should  find  and  apply  to  disputed  issues  of  interpretation  "the  best
justification  . . . of a  past legislative  event."11 2

This  position  is  a  clear  heir  to  the  legal  process  position  -

above
all,  in  its  emphasis  on  the  use  of  judicial  interpretation  to  produce
reasonable  results,  to  guard  against  arbitrariness,  and  to  produce
coherence  in  the  legal  system.  As  did  its  legal  process  predecessors,
Dworkin's  approach  sees  the  courts  partly  as  agents  (hence  the  em-
phasis on  "what the  legislature  has  done") and  partly as  creative  actors
relying  on  normative  theories  of their  own.  In  a  number  of respects,
Dworkin's  approach  fits  congenially  with  what  I  suggest  here:  it,  too,
insists  on  judicial  efforts  to  promote  a  principled  rather  than  ad  hoc
set of legal  requirements  and to  foster  what Dworkin  calls  "integrity,"
sometimes  in  the  face  of legislative  "intent" or the  actual  character  of
the  legislative  process. 113

Dworkin's  approach  is  marred,  however,  by  the  open-ended  char-
acter  of  its  guiding  interpretive  principle  -
a  failing  that  provides
the  final  link  between  Dworkin's  effort  and  that  of  the  legal process
school.  The  dangers  of judicial  discretion  in  searching  for  and  giving
content  to  "the  best principle"  are  largely  unaddressed.  Dworkin  fails
to  explore  the  institutional  background,  or  the  substantive  functions
and  failures  of  statutory  regimes.  The  characteristics  of  the  modern
regulatory  state  are  entirely  invisible  in  Dworkin's  treatment.  Dwor-
kin's  account  draws  far  too  sharp  a  dichotomy  between  "the  best
principle"  -
found  through  tools  external  (to  what  extent?)  to  the
disputed  provision  or  the  prevailing  legal  culture  -
and  "what  the
legislature  has  done,"  with  the  latter  sometimes  treated  as  if it  were
a kind  of brute  fact. 1 4

113  Indeed,  the  notion  of  "integrity"  bears  some  resemblance  to  the  goals  of  statutory  con-

struction  described  in  Part IV.

114  By  contrast,  the  approach  of  this  Article  charges  the  judge  neither  with  invoking  an
external  "best  principle"  nor with assessing,  as  if it were  a datum,  something  the legislature  "has

INTERPRETING STATUTES

For  this  reason  -

and  this  is  the  central  problem  - Dworkin's
effort  to  find  the  principle  that  best justifies  what  the  legislature  has
done  is  largely  untethered.  An  emphasis  on  text,  history,  or intention
seems  a most  appealing  refuge  from  a  general  inquiry  of that  sort.  In
particular,  reliance  on  the  text  seems  to  have  a  far  better  democratic
pedigree  and to  hold  far more  promise  for  limiting judicial  discretion.
4.  The  Proper Role  of  Traditional Sources  of Meaning  and  the
Failure of the Agency  View.  - The discussion  thus far  suggests several
conclusions  about the  use  of traditional  tools  of statutory  construction.
The  text,  understood  in  its  context  and  in  concert  with  shared  back-
ground  norms,  is  usually  sufficient  to  resolve  interpretive  disputes.
Sometimes,  however,  the  text  is  ambiguous  or  reveals  a delegation  or
gap.  Moreover,  the  ordinary  meaning  of  the  text  should  not  be  de-
cisive  when  the statutory  structure  or  purpose (if subject  to  an  uncon-
troversial  characterization)  suggests  an  alternative  meaning,  and  when
a  literal  interpretation  would  produce  a  patently  unjust  or  irrational
application  that  was  not  clearly  sought  by  the  legislature.  Similarly,
the  legislative  "intent"  -
is
admissible  to  resolve  ambiguities,  but  it  usually  should  not  be  per-
mitted  to  overcome  the  ordinary  meaning  of  the  statutory  words  if
that  meaning  is  otherwise  clear.  The  only  exception  is  when  the
history  supports  the  conclusion  that  literalism  would  produce  unin-
tended  irrationality  or  injustice." 5  In  some  cases,  however,  all  of
these  sources  of  statutory  meaning  will  leave  serious  gaps  or  uncer-
tainties,  and  sometimes  interpretive  principles  are  properly  invoked
to  press  language  in  particular  directions.

as  reflected  in  the  legislative  history  -

As  complete  theories  of  statutory  construction, 

then,  the  most
prominent  examples  of  the  agency  view  of the  judicial  role  appear  to
fail;  it  is  time  to  consider  the  implications  of  that  failure." 6  The
agency view  starts  from  the  important truth  that it would  be improper
for  judges  to  construe  statutes  to  mean  whatever  the  judges  think
best;  the  lawmaking  primacy  of the  legislature,  with  its superior  dem-
ocratic  pedigree, 1 17 prohibits  such  a conception  of statutory  "interpre-
tation."  It  follows  from  this  understanding  that where  there  is  neither
interpretive  doubt  nor  constitutional  objection,  the  judgment  of  the
electorally  accountable  branch  should  prevail.

done."  The  interpreter's  understanding  of what  the  legislature  has  done  and  the  interpreter's
own  principles  are  a  product  of background  norms;  the two  cannot  be  separated.
Is  See,  e.g.,  Green  v.  Bock  Laundry  Mach.  Co.,  iog  S.  Ct.  1981  (1989).
116 In  fact,  it is  doubtful  that  any judge  subscribes  to  the  view  that  the  agency  theory  is  a

complete  one.  The  theory  operates  largely  as  a  rhetorical  device  or  a rallying cry,  and  as  such,
it is  useful  in disciplining  judges  but also  highly  misleading.

117  Both  disparities  in  political  influence  and  the  difficulties  described  by  Arrow,  see  K.
ARRow,  supra note  i5,  make  it necessary  to  be  cautious  about this  point.  See  generally infra
note  X48  (describing  difficulties  with  attributing  purpose  to  multimember  legislative  bodies).

[Vol.  103:405

The  agency  theory  requires  that judges  exercise  minimal  discretion
and  avoid  inquiries  into  the  constitutional  backdrop,  appropriate  in-
stitutional  arrangements,  statutory  function,  or  larger  social  goals.
Instead,  the  judge  must  be  largely  a  functionary  performing  a  me-
chanical  process.  This  is,  at bottom,  a formalist  position  -
formalist
because  it sees the process  as entirely  autonomous  and free  from  value-
laden  inquiries.  Formalism  and  the  agency  view  are  entirely  unob-
jectionable  insofar  as  they  recognize  an  important  distinction  -
itself
value-laden  to  be  sure  -
between  the  relatively  constrained  operation
of adjudicating  statutory  questions  ("interpretation")  and  the  relatively
open-ended  process  of legislating.  But like  all  formalist  positions,  the
agency  view  of  statutory  interpretation  is  subject  to  two  sorts  of
objections.

First,  the  agency  conception  of  "meaning"  is  too  crude.  As  we
have  seen,  language  is  not self-interpreting,  and  sometimes  legislators
delegate,  self-consciously  or otherwise,  gap-filling  power  to  the  courts.
Moreover,  the  instructions  of  the  principal  are  unintelligible  without
background  norms  that  interpreters  alone  can  supply.  Usually  such
norms  are  uncontested  within  the  legal  culture,  and  therefore  it  is
sufficient  to  rely  on  the  generally  accepted  meanings  of  words.  In
such  cases,  the  incompleteness  of  formalism  is  not  troublesome  for
interpretive  practice,  and  the  uncontested  meanings  should  ordinarily
be  given  their  full  scope.  In  other  cases,  courts  must  resort  to  con-
testable  or  conspicuous  interpretive  principles,  or  gap-filling  devices,
in  order  to  decide  the  question  of  meaning.  It  is  important  to  em-
phasize  that  this  is  a  conceptual  or  logical  claim,  not  a  proposition
about  the  appropriate  distribution  of  powers  among  administrative
agencies,  courts,  and  legislatures.  It depends  not  at  all  on  a belief  in
the  wisdom  and  decency  of  the  judges.  To  recognize  the  need  for
interpretive  norms  when  Congress  has  not  enacted  them  is  not  to
confer  on  courts  power  that  they  do  not  already,  and  necessarily,
have.

Second,  the  broad  legitimacy  claims  of  the  agency  theory  rely  on
question-begging  and  probably  indefensible  premises.  For such  claims
to  be  persuasive,  those  who  invoke  the  agency  theory n1 8  must  claim
that  a  formalist  approach  to  construction  -
again,  to  the  (limited)
extent  that  it  is  possible  -
is  constitutionally  compelled,  or  (what
may  amount to  much  the  same  thing) will  lead  on  balance  to  the  best
or  most  sensible  system  of law. 119  This  latter  claim  must  be  under-

INTERPRETING STATUTES

stood  as  a  belief  that  the  ordinary  or  original  meaning  of  statutory
words  must  control,  even  if it would  lead  to  absurd  or unjust  results.
But  it  is  far  more  likely  that  the  occasional  introduction  of  other
considerations  will  lead  to  a  superior  system.

For example,  assume  that statutory  language,  while  ambiguous,  is
most  naturally  read  to  lead  in  a  direction  that  is,  by  consensus,
irrational;  that  a  statute  might  be  understood  as  giving  open-ended
authority  to  a bureaucracy;  that  the  most obvious  reading  of a  statute
provides  bizarre  or  unjust  results  in  light  of changes  in  the  fifty  years
since  its  enactment.  We  will  encounter  many  such  cases  below.  In
all  of  these  settings,  courts  that  act  as  more  than  mere  agents  and
that  invoke  contestable  background  norms  will  produce  a  more  sen-
sible  system  of  law.  Indeed,  sometimes  such  a  role  will  be  consistent
with  the  best  reading  of Congress'  interpretive  instructions,  or will  be
the  best  understanding  to  attribute  to  Congress  when  it has  made  no
considered  judgment  on  the  point.  For  this  reason,  courts  should  be
authorized  to  depart  from  the  ordinary  or  original  meaning  and  to
press  ambiguous  words  in  particular  directions  if  the  context  suggests
that this  would  lead  to  superior  outcomes.120

Of  course,  there  are  risks  in  admitting  power  of this  sort,  largely
in  the  form  of  increased  judicial  discretion.  For  this  reason,  invoca-
tion  of  controversial  background  norms  should  be  modest.  Although
no  decisive  argument  is  available  to  demonstrate  why  and  to  what
extent the  recognition  of such  authority will make  matters better rather
than  worse,  it is  possible  to  point to  institutional  characteristics  of the
judiciary  that  occasionally  justify  what  might seem  an  aggressive  role
in  interpretation.

First,  the  focus  on  the  particular  circumstances  enables  judges  to
deal  with  applications  that  no  legislature,  no  matter  how  farsighted,
could  conceivably  have  foreseen.  Under  changed  or  unforeseen  cir-
cumstances,  mechanical  application  of  statutory  terms  is  unlikely  to
produce  sound  results,  even  from  the  standpoint  of the  enacting  leg-
islature.  By contrast,  judicial  resolution  of individual  cases,  allowing
an  emphasis  on  particular  settings  with  which  a lawmaker  could  not
be  familiar,  contains  significant  advantages  for  interpretation. 12 1

120  In  civil  law  systems,  this  point  is  conventional,  and  a  judicial  role  of  this  sort  is  fully
consistent  with  legal  practice  throughout  this  country's  history,  even  before  nationhood.  See
Zweigart  & Puttfarken,  Statutory Interpretation - Civilian Style,  44  TUL.  L.  REV.  704,  707-
08 (197o);  infra note  124.  Something  like  it was  suggested  by Alexander Hamilton  himself.  See

legislature;  it  is  quite  another  thing  to  say  that  this  principle  implies  a  theory  barring  courts
from  interpreting  statutes  with  the  aid  of sometimes  controversial  background  norms.  In light
of  the  relevant  history,  the  view  that the Constitution  carries  with  it this  quite  novel  theory  of
interpretation  is  hard  to  sustain.

IVol.  103:405

Second,  because  of  their  independence  and  their  deliberative  ca-
pacities,  courts  have  significant  advantages  over  a legislature  that may
be  influenced  by  parochial  interests  and  is  frequently  responsive  to
momentary  demands.122  Considerations  of  this  sort  were  emphasized
in  The  Federalist, quite  outside  of  the  context  of  constitutional  re-
view. 123  Those  considerations  support  a relatively  aggressive  role  for
the  courts  in  statutory  interpretation,  one  that  sees  judges  as  some-
thing  other  than  agents.  That  position  is  consistent  as  well  with
historical  practice. 124

It  would  of  course  be  possible  to  use  contestable  principles  mod-
estly  or quite  aggressively,  and  courts  have  occasionally  used interpre-
tive  norms  to  construe  statutes  in  ways  that  are  plainly  inconsistent
with  the  outcome  that  would  be  reached  through  reliance  on  text,
structure,  purpose,  and  ordinary  understandings  of  linguistic  com-
mands. 125  As  a general  rule,  however,  courts  should  use  controversial
background  norms  sparingly,  in  deference  to  the  basic  principle  of
democratic  primacy.  But  in  some  situations  -
for  example,  when
conventional  interpretation would  produce  absurdity or gross injustice,
when  changed  circumstances  call  for  creativity,  when  constitutional
considerations  counsel  courts  to  interpret  statutes  in  one  direction  -

involving  interpretation  of  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Act  and  the  Delaney  Clause.
See  infra pp.  489-93,  496-97.

122  Public  choice  theory  shows  that  legislation  imperfectly  reflects  the  desires  of  the "public"
and  indeed  that  the  concept  of  a  public  will  is  a  confused  one.  See,  e.g.,  K.  ARROW,  supra
note  15;  see  also sources  cited  infra note  148  (discussing  the economic  theory  of  legislation).

123  In The  Federalist No.  78,  Hamilton  wrote:
But  it is  not with  a view  to infractions  of  the constitution  only  that the  independence  of
the  judges may  be  an  essential  safeguard  against  the effects  of  occasional  ill  humours  in
the  society.  These  sometimes  extend  no  farther  than  to  the  injury  of  the  private  rights
of  particular  classes  of citizens,  by  unjust  and  partial  laws.  Here  also  the  firmness  of
the judicial  magistracy  is  of vast  importance  in mitigating  the  severity,  and  confining  the
operation  of such  laws.  It  not only  serves  to  moderate  the  immediate  mischiefs  of those
which  may  have  been  passed,  but  it  operates  as  a  check  upon  the  legislative  body  in
passing  them;  who,  perceiving  that obstacles  to  the  success  of an  iniquitous  intention  are
to  be  expected  from  the  scruples  of  the  courts,  are  in  a  manner  compelled  by  the  very
motives  of  the  injustice  they meditate,  to  qualify  their  attempts.

courts  should  be  more  aggressive  in  statutory  interpretation.  In  the
abstract,  these  observations  make  it difficult  to  decide  to  what  extent
departures  from  the  agency  model  are  appropriate.  The  discussion  in
Part  IV  is  designed  to  provide  a  more  concrete  understanding  of  the
problem.

B.  Indeterminacy?  Conventionalism?

The  problems  with  textualism  and  with the  agency  view  lead  some
to  conclude  that  statutory interpretation  produces  unpredictability  and
indeterminacy  in  most  or  all  cases. 12 6  Noting  that  interpretation  is
possible  only  within  the  context  of interpretive  conventions, 12 7  others
argue  that  it  is  not possible  to  change,  debate,  or even  theorize  about
interpretation.  One  just does  it.

Those  who  accept  conventionalism  differ  from  those  who  believe
that  statutory  meaning  produces  indeterminacy.  For  conventionalists,
meaning  is  hardly  open-ended.  But  the  two  camps  have  much  in
common.  Both  reject  the  possibility  of  criteria  with  which  to  distin-
guish  between  good  and  bad  interpretations,  or  to  mediate  disputes
over  meaning.  In  both  accounts,  words  have  the  meanings  that  they
do  simply  because  people  in  positions  of  authority  so  interpret  them.
On  this  point,  both  accounts  are  inadequate.

i.  Indeterminacy. -

It  is  not  always  clear  whether  the  claims  of
indeterminacy  are  meant  to  be  normative  or  positive.  According  to
the  normative  version,  there  are  no  correct  answers  to  questions  of
statutory  interpretation,  but  instead  merely  subjective  (and  perhaps
arbitrary)  opinions. 128  In  contrast,  the  positive  version  has  it  that
judicial  decisions  cannot  be  predicted  in  advance,  even  if  there  are
criteria  by  which  reasonable  people  might  mediate  among  interpretive
disputes.

Whether  normative  or  positive,  the  claim  that  statutory  meaning
is  "indeterminate"  is  wildly  overstated.  Claims  about  the  inevitable
indeterminacy  of  interpretation  usually  suffer  from  a  failure  to  take
account  of  the  contextual  character  of  linguistic  commands.  Com-
munication  is  possible  only  because  of  agreement  over  the  governing

126  See J.  FRANK,  LAW AND  THE  MODERN  MIND  190-92  (1930);  see also R.  UNGER,  Supra
note  17,  at  94-98  (arguing  that  a  coherent  theory  of  legal  adjudication  is  not  possible  on  the
premises  of liberal  thought).

127  See  S.  FISH,  DOING  WHAT  COMES  NATURALLY,  sup-a note  18,  at  357-58;  S.  FIsH,  Is
THERE  A TEXT  IN THIS  CLASS?,  sup  a note  18,  at  i3-15,  331-32.  Compare  the  conventionalist
position  with  Holmes'  claim  that  law  consists  of "what  the  courts  will  do  in fact,  and  nothing
more,"  Holmes,  The  Path of the  Law,  io  HARV.  L.  REV.  457,  461  (1897)  -
a  claim  that  is
unhelpful  for  a judge  trying  to  decide  what to  "do  in  fact."

128 But  cf.  S.  FISH,  Is  THERE  A TEXT IN  THIS  CLASS?,  sup a note  IS,  at  268  (arguing that,
in  interpretation,  there  are  obvious  and  inescapable  meanings  resulting  from  shared  interpretive
assumptions).

rules;  these  rules  enable  people  to  understand  each  other,  and  they
sharply  limit  the  number  of  possible  interpretations. 129  When  taken
in  their  context  and  culture  -
in  their  setting  -
statutes  are  usually
susceptible  to  only  one  plausible  meaning.  Judicial  interpretation  of
statutes  is  therefore  quite  predictable,  largely  because  background
norms  are  uncontested  among  the  judges.  Even  where  background
norms  are  in  conflict,  it  is  often  possible  to  know  how  the  case  will
come  out,  or at least to  limit the  number  of possible  outcomes,  because
one  can  predict  which  norms  will  govern  in  the  circumstances.  For
this  reason,  the  claim  of  indeterminacy,  if taken  as  a positive  one,  is
implausible.

It  is  possible  to  show  as  well  that  some  interpretations  are  cor-
rect. 130  This  is  most  obviously  true  in  easy  cases,  in  which  there  is
no  controversy  over the meaning  of text in light of background  norms;
but  it is  true  in  hard  cases  as  well -
a point to  which  I return  below.
To  make  the  unsurprising  point  that  the  choice  among  interpretive
strategies  or  background  norms  implicates  a  value judgment  is  hardly
to  say  that  the  choice  is  arbitrary.  The  existence  of  judgments  of
value  leads  to  a  conclusion  of  arbitrariness  only  for  the  most  incorri-
gible  of positivists.  Moreover,  the  fact that  someone  might  argue  that
a  statute  does  not  mean  what  it appears  to  say,  or might  characterize
the  legislative  purpose  in  a  counterintuitive  way,  does  not  mean  that
such  arguments  are  convincing  or  even  plausible.  Nor  does  the  ex-
istence  of some  hard  cases  mean  that all  cases  are  hard.  The  ultimate
task is  to develop  criteria  by which  to  mediate  among  conflicting value
judgments  in  concrete  cases,  including  hard  ones  -
a  task  taken  up
in  Part  IV.

2.  Conventionalism. - These  points  help  to  identify  the  flaws  in
conventionalist  accounts  of legal  interpretation.  It  is  correct  and  sal-
utary  to  emphasize,  as  conventionalists  do,  that  interpretive  assump-
tions  are  always  in  force,  and  that  texts  do  not  have  "inherent"  or
"necessary" meanings  in  the  strong  sense  that  those  meanings  remain
constant  across  different  contexts  and cultures.  Moreover,  some words
simply  mean  what  they  mean;  they  are  not a subject  of reflection  and
criticism  to  someone  who  speaks  the  language. 13 1  But  these  claims
-
attacks  on  implausible  versions  of  textualism  or  formalism  -
provide  little  help  in  the  descriptive  or  normative  tasks  of  interpre-

129  See  Easterbrook,  supra  note  13,  at  533  n.2  (discussing  Wittgenstein's  contention  that

"meaning"  is  supplied  by  the  community).

130  The  criteria  for  correctness  here  are  intended  to  be  pragmatic  in  character.  See  R.

POSNER,  supra note  123;  Sunstein,  Beyond the Republican Revival,  97  YALE  L.J.  1539,  1554-
s5  (i988).  In so  saying,  I  do  not mean  to  take  a side  in the debate  between  realists  and skeptics
about  foundations  for  right  answers  in  the  law  or  speculate  on  the  possibility  that  a  resort  to
interpretation  will  make  that  debate  unnecessary.  See  generally Moore,  The  Interpretive Turn

INTERPRETING ST4TUTES

tation.  They  do  not  explain  how  conflicts  within  a  group  of  inter-
preters  should  be,  or  in  fact  are,  resolved.  Above  all,  they  do  not
suggest  that  participants  in  the  legal  culture  should  rest  content  with
existing interpretive  strategies,  or that it is  impossible  to evaluate  those
strategies  or  proposed  alternatives.  Interpreters  in  fact choose  among
strategies  on  the  basis  of the reasons  offered  on  their  behalf.  To  claim
that meaning  is  only  a function  of culture  is  to  give  up  on  the  impor-
tant  questions  altogether.

Moreover,  the  conventionalist  suggestion  that  interpretive  norms
themselves  need  interpretation 3 2  hardly  suggests  that  there  are  no
criteria  for  assessing  particular  norms,  or  that  people  are  unable  to
explain  why  some  such  norms  would  make  things  worse  rather  than
better. 133  In  short,  the  conventionalist  account  is  both  too  crude  and
too  flat.  It treats  interpreters  as  always  the  objects  or  recipients,  and
never  the  subjects  or  creators,  of  interpretive  practice.  It  fails  to
account  for  the  related  phenomena  of choice  among  interpretive  strat-
egies  and  of change  over  time.

C.  Extratextual Norms

In  recent  years,  courts  and  commentators  have  proposed  three
theories of statutory  construction  that rely  on  extratextual  norms.  The
first  involves  a  background  rule  in  favor  of  private  ordering;  the
second  calls  for  a  rule  of  deference  to  regulatory  agencies;  the  third
refers  to  the  difficulties  in  aggregating  diverse  legislative  views  and
the  notion  that  statutes  represent  "deals"  among  self-interested  actors.
Each  of these  approaches  suffers  from  significant  flaws.

i.  Private Ordering. - On  one  view,  the  constitutional  system
leaves  citizens  free  to  conduct  their  affairs  without  governmental  in-
terference,  and  that basic  principle  requires  courts to  interpret statutes
to extend  only  as far  as  their  explicit language  and  history  require. 13 4
For  example,  courts  should  not  recognize  implied  causes  of  action,
since  statutes  ought  not  be  taken  to  intrude  on  private  autonomy
except to  the extent that they  do  so unambiguously. 13 5  An interpretive
principle  of this  sort  would  have  enormous  consequences  for  statutory
interpretation;  it  would  limit  statutes  in  all  areas  of  social  and  eco-
nomic  regulation,  from  discrimination  law  to  pollution  control  to  se-
curities  fraud.  In  short,  the  private  ordering  norm  requires  that  stat-
utes  with gaps  or ambiguities  be interpreted  unfavorably  towards  their
intended  beneficiaries.

[Vol.  103:405

The  presumption  in  favor  of  private  ordering  is  merely  the  most
recent  incarnation  of  the view,  set  out  in  the  early  twentieth  century
and  before,  that  statutes  in  derogation  of the  common  law  should  be
read  against  a  laissez-faire  baseline  and  narrowly  construed. 13 6  In
some  legal  systems,  and  in  some  contexts,  such  a presumption  would
be  desirable;  and  the  presumption  is  always  sound  insofar  as  it  rec-
ognizes  that  where  Congress  has  neither  legislated  nor  left  a  gap  for
interpreters  to  fill,  no  law  constrains  private  behavior.  In  the  wake
of  the  New  Deal,  however,  a  broad  interpretive  norm  in  favor  of
private  ordering  can  no  longer  be  sustained.  This  is  so  partly  because
the  post-New  Deal  system  is  generally  superior  to  its  common  law
predecessor  insofar  as it recognizes  that private  autonomy  is  a product
of  legal  controls  and  that  modern  regulation  often  promotes  both
economic  welfare  and  distributive  justice. 13 7  The  more  fundamental
problem  with  the  broad  presumption  in  favor  of private  autonomy  is
its  inconsistency  with  the  values  that  underlie  modern  government.
Such  a  presumption  would  invoke  understandings  repudiated  by  the
democratic  branches  of government  in  order,  ironically,  to  discern  the
reach  of  statutes  enacted  and  administered  by  those  very  branches.
It would  be highly  undemocratic,  and indeed  presumptuous,  for courts
to  invoke  laissez-faire  principles  in  support  of  such  a  judicial  role.
Gaps  should  not  be  filled  in,  and  ambiguities  should  not  be  resolved,
by  reference  to  norms  that  run  counter  to  those  of the  enacting  Con-
gress  in  particular  and  the  modern  regulatory  state  in  general.

2.  Deference to Agency  Interpretations of Law. 138  - Another  view,
finding  considerable  support  in  recent  cases,  maintains  that  courts
should  defer  to  agency  interpretations  of law  whenever  the  statute  is
ambiguous.  Because  of  their  superior  accountability,  expertise,  and
ability  to  coordinate  complex  enactments,  agencies  should  be  given
the  benefit of every  doubt.  Unlike  the  private  ordering  principle,  this
view  has  roots  in  the  New  Deal  period,  with  that  era's  endorsement
of  administrative  autonomy;  and  it places  a  strong  emphasis  on  the

136  See supra pp.  407-08.  This basic  approach  to regulatory  statutes operated  as the statutory
analogue  to  the constitutional  principle  in Lochner  v.  New  York,  198  U.S.  45  (19o5),  in  which
the  Court  treated  certain  statutory  measures  as  impermissible  deviations  from  the  "neutral"
principles  reflected  in  the  common  law.  Both  principles  were  properly  rejected.  They  used  a
highly  controversial  set  of regulatory  ideas,  embodied in  nineteenth-century  common  law,  as  the
baseline  against  which to  decide  the scope  of innovations  developed  by  the democratic  branches
in  a  conscious  rejection  of the  common  law.  The  legal  realists  -
important  forces  behind  the
New  Deal  reformation  -
argued  that governmental  power lay behind  common  law  rules,  which
could  not,  therefore,  be  treated as  merely facilitative  of private desires;  they  played  a constitutive
role  as  well.  See  Cohen,  Property and Sovereignty, 13  CORNELL  L.Q.  8  (1927);  Hale,  Coercion
and  Distribution in a  Supposedly Non-Coercive State,  38  POL.  Sci.  Q.  470  (1923).

INTERPRETING STATUTES

displacement  of  judicial  lawmaking  represented  by  the  creation  of
regulatory  schemes.  Thus,  in  the  exceptionally  important  Chevron
case, 139  the  Supreme  Court  said  that  courts  should  defer  to  agency
interpretations  of  law  unless  "Congress  has  directly  spoken  to  the
precise  question  at issue. 1 40

Even  if  read  for  all  that  it is  worth,  the  Chevron position  would
not  resolve  every  disputed  statutory  question.  Threshold  interpretive
questions  must  be  asked  and  answered  even  under  Chevron.  For
example,  courts  have  to rely on  some  methodology  that is  independent
of the  rule  of deference  to  decide  when  statutes  are  ambiguous.  The
rule  of  deference  would,  however,  have  significant  consequences,  be-
cause  it  would  remit  all  uncertain  cases  to  regulatory  agencies  for
administrative  resolution.  Moreover,  such  a rule is  quite  appealing, 141
especially  when  Congress  has  delegated  law-interpreting  power  to  the
agency  or  when  the  question  involves  the  agency's  specialized  fact-
finding  and  policymaking  competence,  as  do  "mixed"  issues  of  law
and  fact.

For  several  reasons,  however,  a  general  rule  of judicial  deference
to  all  agency  interpretations  of law  would  be  unsound.  The  case  for
deference  depends  in the first instance  on  congressional  instructions. 142
If  Congress  has  told  courts  to  defer  to  agency  interpretations,  courts
must do  so.  But  many  regulatory  statutes  were  born  out  of legislative
distrust for  agency  discretion;  they  represent  an  effort to  limit  admin-
istrative  authority through  clear  legislative  specifications. 143 A rule  of
deference  in  the face  of ambiguity  would  be  inconsistent  with  under-
standings,  endorsed  by  Congress,  of  the  considerable  risks  posed  by
administrative  discretion.14 4  An  ambiguity  is  simply  not  a  delegation
of law-interpreting  power.  Chevron confuses  the  two.

139 Chevron  U.S.A.,  Inc.  v.  National  Resources  Defense  Council,  Inc.,  467  U.S.  837  (1984);
see  also  NLRB  v.  United  Food  & Commercial  Workers  Union,  Local  23,  1o8  S.  Ct.  413,  421
(1987)  (advocating  deference  to  administrative  interpretation  in  the  absence  of  an  unambiguous
statutory  command).

140  Chevron,  467  U.S.  at  842.  But  see  Immigration  &  Naturalization  Serv.  v.  Cardoza-
Fonseca,  480  U.S.  421,  446-48 (1987)  (arguing that  courts  should  not  defer  to  agency  interpre-
tations  on  pure  questions  of law  but only  on  mixed  questions  of  law  and  fact).

Limited  Resources for Judicial Review  of Agency  Action,  87  COLUM.  L.  REV.  1093,  1117-29
(1987).  The  Chevron  approach  might  enable  agencies  to  apply  rigid  measures  in  a  way  that
takes  account  of  difficulties  in  applications  to  concrete  settings;  facilitate  coordination  and
consistency  in  the  regulatory  process;  counteract  the  effects  of  obsolete  statutes;  and  promote
accountability  by considering  the  different  views  of different  administrations.

Second,  the notion  that  administrators  may  interpret  statutes  that
they  administer  is  inconsistent  with  separation  of  powers  principles
that  date  back  to  the  early  days  of the  American  republic 45  and  that
retain  considerable  vitality today. 146 The basic  case for judicial  review
depends  on  the  proposition  that  foxes  should not  guard  henhouses.  It
would  be most peculiar,  for example,  to  argue that  courts should  defer
to  congressional  or  state  interpretations  of  constitutional  provisions
whenever  there  is  ambiguity  in  the  constitutional  text.  Those  who
are  limited  by  a legal  restriction  should  not  be  permitted  to  determine
the  nature  of the  limitation,  or  to  decide  its  scope.  The  relationship
of the  Constitution  to  Congress  parallels  the  relationship  of governing
statutes  to  agencies.  In  both  contexts,  an  independent  arbiter  should
determine  the  nature  of the  limitation.

This  basic  principle  assumes  special  importance  in  light  of  the
awkward  constitutional  position  of  the  administrative  agency.  Broad
delegations  of power  to  regulatory  agencies  have  been  allowed  largely
on  the  assumption  that  courts  would  be  available  to  ensure  agency
fidelity  to  whatever  statutory  directives  have  been  issued. 147  If agen-
cies  are  able  to  decide  on  the  meaning  of  ambiguities  in  these  direc-
tives,  the  nondelegation  problem  grows  dramatically.  A  firm  judicial
hand  in  the  interpretation  of statutes  is  thus  desirable.

The  point  can  be  made  more  vivid  by  imagining  cases  involving
such  questions  as  whether  agency  action  is  reviewable;  whether  agen-
cies  may  issue  fines;  whether  agency  jurisdiction  extends  to  new  or
unforeseen  areas.  In  all  of  these  cases,  it would  be  peculiar  to  say
that  the  agency  is  permitted  to  decide  the  meaning  of  a  law  whose
scope  is  so  directly  relevant  to agency  self-interest.  In  short,  a general
rule  of deference  to agency interpretations  of law would be  inconsistent
with  the  best  reading  of  Congress'  interpretive  instructions,  with  the
constitutional  backdrop,  and  with  the  goal  of promoting  sound  regu-
latory  policy.

3.  Public Choice  Theory  and  "Deals." - A  number  of  commen-
tators  have  recently  attempted  to  find  guidance  for  statutory  interpre-
tation  in  welfare  economics  and  public  choice  theory.  Two  claims  are
crucial  here  -
the  first  descriptive,  the  second  normative.  The  first
claim  is  that the concept of legislative  purpose is  incoherent. 148  Seeing

INTERPRETING STATUTES

politics  not  as  an  effort  to  carry  out  coherent  or  public-regarding
purposes  but  as  a  battle  for  scarce  resources  among  self-interested
private  groups,  these  commentators  maintain  that  the  legislative  pro-
cess  is  a  series  of  interest-group  struggles.  They  also  emphasize  the
difficulties  in  aggregating  the  preferences  and  beliefs  of  numerous
legislators.  From  this  they  conclude  that  statutes  reflect  unprincipled
"deals"  and  not  intelligible  collective  "purposes."  Some  of those  who
urge  this  view  claim  that  it  has  foundations  in  the  thought  of  the
framers  of  the  Constitution. 149

The  second  claim  is  that  courts  charged  with  interpreting  statutes
should  not  rely  on  unitary  or  public-regarding  purposes,  but  instead
should  enforce  the  statute  according  to  its  terms,  which  reveal  the
relevant  "deal."  Courts should  not see  legislators  as  "reasonable  people
acting  reasonably."  Instead,  statutes  are  often  unprincipled  outcomes
of  multiple  pressures  imposed  on  multiple  actors.  The  contrast  with
the  legal  process  school  in  particular  could  not  be  sharper.15 0

Consider,  for  example,  how  an  advocate  of  the  deals  approach
would  analyze  the  question  whether  a  federal  statute  regulating  pol-
lution  implicitly  authorizes  victims  of pollution  to  bring  suits  against
If  the  statute  does  not expressly  provide  for  such  suits,  the
polluters. 
victims  have  not  obtained  that  right  as  part  of  the  statutory  "deal,"
and  the  right  should  be  denied.  By  contrast,  a  court  that  saw  the
legislature  as  "reasonable  people  acting  reasonably,"  or  that  treated

a  multimember  body.  First,  efforts  to aggregate  multiple  points  of view  through  legislation  will
not  yield  an  intelligible  preference  of  the  collectivity.  Even  if legislators  vote  according  to  their
actual  preferences,  the  outcome  may  not  reflect  a  coherent  aggregation  of  preferences  because
the outcome  eventually  chosen  depends on  the order in  which different  proposals were  considered
rather  than  on  a  collective  preference  for  that  outcome.  See  K. ARRow,  supra note  i5,  at  46-
6o  (describing  the Impossibility  Theorem).

Second,  legislators  may  engage  in  strategic  behavior,  especially  if  there  are  three  or  more
alternatives  up for a vote.  For example,  a legislator might decide  to  misrepresent  her preferences
by  voting  for  proposition  x  instead  of  proposition  y  because  the  defeat  of  y  will  increase  the

Manipulation of  Voting  Schemes: A  General Result,  in  RATIONAL  MAN  AND  IRRATIONAL  SO-
CIETY?,  supra note  15,  at  358.  Legislators  also  trade  votes  or  "logroll."  See  B.  BARRY  & R.
HARDIN,  Introduction to  Vickrey,  Utility,  Strategy, and Social Decision Rules,  in  RATIONAL
MAN  AND  IRRATIONAL  SOCIETY?,  supra note  1S,  at  341-42.  These  difficulties  make  it hard  to
discern  a  unitary  purpose  behind  legislative  enactments,  other  than  the purpose  to  do  what the
legislature  has  done.

Third,  the  legislative  outcome  may  reflect  organizational  difficulties  faced  by  diffuse,  poorly
organized  groups,  and  it is  unclear  how  the  complex  interactions  between  the  well-organized
and  the  poorly  organized  should  enter  into  the  depiction  of  "purpose."  See,  e.g.,  R.  HARDIN,
COLLECTIVE  ACTION  (1982).

one  that  has  nothing  to  do  with  deals  -

Advocates  of  the  "deals"  approach  correctly  emphasize  legislative
compromise,  and  they  have  also  performed  a  valuable  role  in  sug-
gesting  that  legislative  purposes  are  often  multiple  and  even  conflict-
ing.  As  a  theory  of  statutory  interpretation,  however,  the  "deals"
approach  suffers  from  many  of  the  failings  of  textualism.  The  first
problem  is  indeterminacy.  In  many  cases,  the  terms  of  any  deal  will
be  hopelessly  unclear  in  the  absence  of  background  norms  that  a
system  of  interpretation  -
alone  can  supply.  For  example,  an  approach  that  sees  statutes  as
deals  is  in  fact  unhelpful  in  cases  involving  implied  causes  of  action.
If a  statute  is  treated  as  a  deal  between  industries  seeking  protection
against  too  much  regulation  on  the  one  hand,  and  environmental
groups  attempting  to  prevent  pollution  on  the  other,  what  result  is
appropriate?  The  answer  would  be  obvious  if  there  were  a  back-
ground  norm  to  the  effect  that  regulatory  statutes  generally  create
private  rights  of action.  In that  case,  the  failure  of industry  to  obtain
a  prohibition  on  such  rights  would  suggest  that  the  deal  authorized
them.  The result would  also  be clear  if the  background  norm  forbade
private  rights  without  explicit  legislative  authorization:  the  deal  did
not  include  them.  The  central  question  is  what  the  relevant  norm
should  be.  The  claim  that  statutes  should  be  understood  as  deals
provides  no  help  in  deciding  on  the  background  against  which  deals
must  be  read.  In  the  end,  advocates  of the  "deals"  approach  -
like
rely  in  fact  on  a substantive  background  norm;15'
most formalists  -
it  is  that  norm,  on  which  the  "deals"  approach  is  utterly  unhelpful
and  indeed  silent,  that  is  the  true  basis for  decision.

Even  if  the  problem  of  indeterminacy  could  be  overcome,  the
question  would  remain  whether  courts  should  treat  statutes  as  un-
principled  deals.  The  argument  in  favor  of  that  system  would  have
to  claim  that  it  is  constitutionally  required,  or  that  the  legal  system
that  would  emerge  would  be  preferable  to  the  alternatives.  Some
have  stressed  the  dangers  of judicial  discretion,  the  fact  that  statutes
are  in  fact  deals,  the  likelihood  that  a  system  of  deals  will  be  respon-
sive to  constituents'  demands  for law, and  the  value  of obtaining  deals
in  the first  place. 152

151  See,  e.g.,  Easterbrook,  supra  note  13,  at  549-50  (relying  on  the  background  norm  of
private  autonomy).  Consider  also  Justice  Scalia's  enthusiastic  resort to  the principle  in favor  of
judicial  deference  to  agency  interpretations  of  law.  See  Immigration  & Naturalization  Serv.  v.

INTERPRETING STATUTES

Often,  however,  efforts  to  understand  statutes  as  deals  depend  on
highly  artificial  premises.  The  empirical  work  points  in  both  direc-
tions.  There  is  evidence  that  public  officials  often  respond  to  their
own  conception  of the public  interest.' 5 3  Numerous  people,  moreover,
help  to  produce  statutes,  and  it  is  not  easy  to  see  how  the  multiple
forces  can  meaningfully  be  thought to  produce  a deal.  The  problems
of  aggregating  multiple  desires  do  not  always  prevent  the  ascription
of  "purpose"  to  legislation.  The  claim  of  realism  is  therefore  over-
stated.

Even  if statutes  were  deals,  the  argument  that  courts  should  al-
ways  treat  them  as  such  is  hardly  self-evident.  Indeed,  the  "deals"
approach  tends  to  break  down  if  conceptions  of  politics  rooted  in
interest-group  pluralism  cannot  be  defended  on  normative  grounds.
Far  from  having  a  good  constitutional  pedigree,  the  pluralist  under-
standing  runs  afoul  of  the  fundamental  constitutional  norm  against
naked  interest-group  transfers. 15 4  That  norm  proscribes  legislative
efforts  to  transfer  resources  from  one  group  to  another  simply  because
of the  political  power  of  the latter.  The  norm  has  firm  roots  in  both
Madisonian  republicanism  -
designed  to  ensure  a  measure  of delib-
eration  in  government  -
and  in  current  law  under  a  number  of
constitutional  provisions,  including  the  equal  protection,  due  process,
eminent  domain,  and  contract  clauses.' 55  An  effort  to  treat  statutes
as  mere  deals  is  thus  inconsistent  with  the  basic  constitutional  back-
ground.

Moreover, 

interest-group  pluralism  cannot  be  defended  as  a
method  for ensuring  accurate  aggregation  of citizen  preferences.  Pub-
lic  choice  theory  itself  reveals  that  pluralist  systems  reflect  collective

153  See,  e.g.,  M.  DERTHICK  & P.  QuIRK,  THE  POLITICS  OF  DEREGULATION  (1985);  Kalt  &
Zupan,  Capture and  Ideology  in  the  Economic  Theory  of Politics, 74  AM.  ECON.  REV.  279
(1984).

SS On  Madisonian  republicanism,  see  Sunstein,  Interest Groups in American  Public Law,
38  STAN.  L.  REV.  29,  38-48  (1985).  On  the  norm  against  naked  interest-group  transfers,  see
id.;  Sunstein,  cited  above  in  note  154;  and  sources  cited  in  note  245  below.

To  be  sure,  courts  usually  find  a  public-regarding  justification  for  legislation,  and  therefore
invalidate  statutes  as  naked  interest-group  transfers  only  infrequently.  See,  e.g.,  United  States
R.R.  Retirement  Bd.  v.  Fritz,  449  U.S.  166  (i98o)  (finding  that  distinctions  among  railroad
employee  retirement  benefits  plausibly  protect  employees  with  greater  equitable  claims);  Wil-
liamson  v. Lee  Optical,  348 U.S.  483  (1955)  (holding that  requiring an  ophthalmologist  prescrip-
tion  to  allow  an  optician  to  fit  eye  glasses  is  rational  due  to  occasional  necessity  of  medical
prescriptions).  But  judicial  deference  here  is  a  product  of  the  institutional  position  of  the
judiciary,  which  leads  courts  to  give  legislatures  the  benefit  of  every  doubt.  Cf.  Sager,  Fair
Measure: The  Legal Status  of  Underenforced Constitutional Norms,  91  HARV.  L.  REV.  1212,
1213-20  (1978)  (positing  that  many  constitutional  norms  are  underenforced  due  to  institutional
concerns  rather than  conceptual  limits).  The fact of  infrequent  enforcement  should not be taken
to  deny  the  constitutional  status  of  the  norm,  which  can  be  vindicated  by  courts  much  less
intrusively,  and  to  that extent  more  justifiably,  through  statutory  construction.

action  problems,  strategic  behavior,  cycling  problems,  the  power  of
various  groups  over  the  agenda,  and  a  host  of  other  difficulties. 156
Here  descriptive  work  in  the  public  choice, tradition 5 7  helps  to  supply
a  strong normative  argument  against a theory  of statutory construction
that  is  inspired  by  public  choice  theory.  Courts  that  treat  statutes  as
deals  will  tend  to  produce  incoherence  and  irrationality  in  the  law.

Even  if  accurate  preference-aggregation  could  be achieved  through
politics,  it  is  far  from  clear  that  the  system  would  warrant  support.
Politics  performs  a  number  of  functions  that  cannot  be  captured  in
the  notion  of aggregation  of private preferences.  Collective  aspirations
about social justice;  democratic  preferences  for others,  including  future
generations;  and  social  subordination,  which  has  consequences  for  the
preferences  of both  the  advantaged  and  the  disadvantaged  -
all  these
have  called  forth  statutory  regimes  promoting  a  range  of  values  that
a  pluralist  system  cannot  sufficiently  protect. ' 5 8

A  system  of  interpretation  that  treats  statutes  as  interest-group
deals  or  as  incoherent  compromises  therefore  would  suffer  from  a
wide  range  of problems.  By  contrast,  a  regime  in  which  courts  treat
statutes  as  purposive,  rational,  and  public-regarding  would  be  more
likely  to  push  statutes  in  purposive,  rational,  and  public-regarding
directions.  Of course,  a  court  should  respect  a  deal  if  it  is  unambig-
uously  reflected  in  law.  But  an  interpretive  approach  that  is  alert  to
the  risks  of deals  and  that  attempts  to  make  sense  of  statutory  enact-
ments  will  produce  a  superior  system  of law.15 9

4.  Criteria. -

It  will  be  useful  to  conclude  this  section  by  seeing
whether  the  discussion  of  extratextual  norms  suggests  some  general
criteria  by which  to  evaluate  such  norms.  We  have  seen  that a  broad
private  autonomy  principle  may  well  be  objectionable  as  a  theory  of
the appropriate  role of the  state' 60  and  that it lacks  fit with the  modern
regulatory  structure  and  its  underlying  values.  Unlike  the  autonomy
the  principle  of  agency  deference  has  the  advantage  of
principle, 
attempting  to  respond  to  the  real-world  operation  of  the  regulatory
state.  It  is,  however,  inconsistent  with likely  congressional  desires  and
with  the  constitutional  backdrop,  and  if  adopted,  it  would  impair  the
performance  of regulatory  institutions.  The  "deals" approach  properly
brings  to  bear  a  realistic  understanding  of  legislative  processes.  The

INTERPRETING STATUTES

understanding  is,  however,  only  a  partial  one.  The  "deals"  approach
would  ultimately  engraft  onto  interpretation  a  conception  of  politics
that  would  increase  regulatory  irrationality  and  injustice  and  that
would  in  any  case  be  in  severe  tension  with  the  constitutional  frame-
work.

If  these  points  provide  persuasive  grounds  for  rejecting  these  in-
terpretive  norms,  they  suggest  that in  order  to  be  acceptable,  interpre-
tive  norms  must  be  consistent  with  the  constitutional  structure  and
the  fabric  of modern public  law;  must  improve  rather  than  impair the
performance  of  governmental  institutions;  and  must  reflect  a  concep-
tion  of  politics  that  is  likely,  if  adopted,  to  help  combat  defects  in
regulatory  practice.  Criteria  of  this  sort  are  highly  value-laden;  but
they  suggest  that  it  is  possible  both  to  criticize  conventions  and  to
mediate  among  different  interpretive  norms. 161

III.  THE  ROLE  OF  INTERPRETIVE  PRINCIPLES

A.  Karl Llewellyn  and the  Canons of Construction

The  discussion  thus  far  has  suggested  that  the  agency  view  is
inadequate  and  that  interpretive  norms  play  an  indispensable  role  in
statutory  construction.  The  relative  silence  about  the  role  of  such
norms  therefore  presents  something  of  a  puzzle.

Some  help  in  this  regard  might  be  found  in  the  fate  in  academic
circles  of  the  "canons"  of construction.  Although  courts  have  always
used  something  like  "canons"  as  background  principles  for  interpre-
tation,  the  canons  were  criticized  and  indeed  virtually  discredited  by
the  legal  realist  movement.  The  most  conspicuous  example  is  Karl
Llewellyn's  celebrated  effort  to  demonstrate  that  for each  canon  there
is  an  equal  canon  pointing in  the  opposite  direction.1 62  An inspection
of  the  decisions  revealed  that  the  canons  of  construction  did  not  help
to  decide  cases;  instead  they  operated  as  mechanical,  after-the-fact
recitations  disguising  the  reasons  for  decision.

161  To  say  this  is  not to  suggest  that  criteria  can  ever be  entirely  external  to  "conventions,"
at  least  if  these  are  defined  broadly  enough.  The  inquiry  here  is  pragmatic  in  character,  see
supra note  i3o;  it is  sufficient  to  suggest  that  some  norms  can  be  shown,  for  good  reasons,  to
be  preferable  to  others.  See  also  infra pp.  460-62  (discussing  freedom  and  constraint  in devel-
oping  interpretive  norms).

162  See  Llewellyn,  supra note  ig,  at  40o-o6.  For  example,  the  canon  calling  for  adherence
to  the "plain meaning"  of the  text  is  countered  by  the  principle  that courts  should vindicate  the
spirit  of the  law;  the  notion  that  statutes  in  derogation  of the  common  law  should be  narrowly
construed  meets  the  principle  that  remedial  statutes  should  be  broadly  construed;  and  the  idea
that every  word  and  clause  should  be  given  effect  is  countered  by  the principle  that  words  and
clauses  may  be  rejected  as  surplusage  when  they  were  inadvertently  inserted  or  repugnant  to
the  rest  of the statute.  See  id.  at 404.

HARVARD  LAW  REVIEW

[Vol.  103:405

The realists  argued  that the  canons substituted  unhelpful,  mislead-
ing,  and mechanical  rules  for a more  pragmatic  and  functional  inquiry
into  statutory  purposes  and  structure. 163  'This  view  has  deeply  pen-
etrated  modern  legal  culture.  Almost  no  one  has  had  a  favorable
word  to  say  about  the  canons  in  many  years. 164  For  the  most  part,
the  canons  are  treated  as  anachronisms.

Llewellyn's  demonstration  was  persuasive  insofar  as  it  character-
ized  the  use  of  canons  as  a  crude  version  of  formalism. 
In  fact,
however,  his  claim  of  indeterminacy  and  mutual  contradiction  was
greatly  overstated;  some  of  the  canons  actually  influenced  judicial
behavior  insofar  as  they  reflected  background  norms  that  helped  to
give  meaning  to  statutory  words  or  to  resolve  hard  cases.  The  notion
that  courts  should  narrowly  construe  statutes  in  derogation  of  the
common  law  is  the  most  prominent  example.  As  we  have  seen,
Llewellyn's  abandonment  of  the  canons  left  him  with  the  hopelessly
banal  claim  that  decisions  depended  on  "the sense  of the situation as
seen  by  the  court"165  and  that  "a court  must  strive  to  make  sense  as
a whole  out of our  law  as a whole.' 6 6  Llewellyn  did  not  unpack  the
notion  of  "sense"  and  its  possible  relationship  to  canons  of  construc-
tion.  Indeed,  he  did  not recognize  that  quite  particular  -
and  defen-
sible  -
conceptions  of  "sense,"  often  forming  the  judge's  initial,  in-
tuitive,  or  even  considered  response  to  a  statutory  dispute,  might
themselves  be  reflected  in  canons  of  construction.  Llewellyn,  like
many  of  the  realists,  attempted  to  liberate  legal  thought  from  flawed
structures  by  denying  the  need for structures  altogether,  but structures
are  inevitably  present.

The  canons  of  construction  continue  to  be  a prominent  feature  in
the  federal  and state  courts.  The use  of general  guides  to  construction

INTERPRETING STATUTES

-
standings  -

in  the  form  of  "clear-statement"  principles  and  background  under-

can  be  found  in  every  area  of  modern  law.

indeed,  it  consists  largely  of  -

An  analogy  may  be helpful  here.  The law  of contracts  is  pervaded
by  -
a  set  of  principles  filling  con-
tractual  gaps  when  the  parties  have  been  silent,  or  when  the meaning
of  their  words  is  unclear. 16 7  Imagine,  for  example,  that  the  parties
have  been  silent  on  the  time  of  performance,  damages  in  the  event  of
breach,  or  the  consequences  of  dramatically  changed  circumstances
and  partial  default.  The  use  of  implied  terms,  or  "off-the-rack"  pro-
visions,  is  a familiar  part of the  law  of contract;  and  it would  be most
peculiar  to  say  that  they  are  an  illegitimate  incursion  into  the  usual
process  of "interpreting" the  parties'  intent.  Without implied  terms  of
some  sort,  contracts  simply  would  not  be  susceptible  to  construction.
Implied  terms  also provide  the background  against which  people  enter
into  agreements.

To  a  large  degree,  interpretive  principles  -

including  the  tradi-
tional  "canons" 168 -
serve  the  same  function  in  public  law.  They too
help  judges  to  construe  both  statements  and  silences;  they  too  should
not  be seen  as  the intrusion  of controversial  judgments  into  "ordinary"
interpretation.  There  are,  however,  differences  as well  as  similarities.
In  the  law  of  contracts,  it  is  often  said  that  implied  terms  should
attempt  to  "mimic  the  market"  by doing  what  the  parties  would  do  if
they  had  made  provision  on  the  subject. 169  In  this  respect,  contract
law  is  pervaded  by  a  background  norm  in  favor  of  party  autonomy
and  the  market.  In  statutory  construction,  by contrast,  the  notion  of
"mimicking  the  market"  is  unavailable,  and  the  idea  that  one  should
do  what  Congress  would  have  done  is  far  from  a complete  guide.  As
we  have  seen,  how  Congress  would  have  resolved  the  question  is
sometimes  unclear;  sometimes  the resolution  of the enacting  Congress
would  produce  difficulties  as  a  result  of  changed  circumstances; 170
sometimes  courts  properly  call  into  play  principles  - many  of  them

167  See  generally Goetz  & Scott,  The  Limits  of Expanded Choice: An  Analysis of  the Inter-
actions Between  Express and  Implied Contract Terms,  73  CALIF.  L.  REv.  261,  264-89  (1985)
(discussing  the courts'  role  in  creating  implied  contract  terms).

168  1 use  the term  "interpretive  principles"  to encompass  both  the "canons"  and  the full  range
of  norms  that  are  used  in  statutory  construction.  The  notion  of  "canons"  has  an  unduly
mechanistic  connotation,  and  it is  a  misleading description  of the  norms  I am proposing  insofar
as  it suggests  that  those  norms  operate  as  rules.

169  See  Goetz  &  Scott,  supra note  167,  at  266.  There  is  not  universal  agreement  on  this
point.  First,  it is  sometimes  impossible  to  "mimic  the  market"  because  the  market  is  itself  the
function  of  the  governing  legal  rule.  See  Sunstein,  supra note  158,  at  1145-52.  Second,  even
when  possible  to  do  so,  one  might prefer  terms that  serve redistributive  functions,  see  Kennedy,
Distributive and  Paternalist Motives  in  Contract  and  Tort  Law,  with  Special  Reference  to
Compulsory Terms and Unequal Bargaining Power, 41  MD.  L. REv.  563  (1982),  or  that transform

that push statutes  in directions  that diverge
from  the  conclusion  that  Congress  would  have  reached  if it  had  re-
solved  the matter.  Despite  these  differences,  the  critical  point  is  that,
as  in  contract  law,  the  interpretation  of  a text  requires  courts  to  refer
to  background  norms  in  interpreting  terms.

B.  The  Functions of Interpretive Principles:
A  Catalogue

Part  of  the  problem  in  coming  to  terms  with  the  canons  is  that
they  have  served  different  functions,  as  do  the  interpretive  principles
courts  generally  employ.  Some  of these  functions  are  nearly  invisible:
the  norms  are  so  widely  shared,  and  so  central  to  the  very  process  of
communicating  in  English,  that  they  seem  to  be  part  of  the  words
rather  than  part  of  the  interpreter's  tools.  Some  such  "norms"  are
simply  part  of  meaning  and  not  open  to  discussion;  others  are  also
invisible  but  value-laden  and potentially  subject  to evaluation. 171  Still
other  norms  look  to  values  that  more  visibly  serve  substantive  or
institutional  goals  and  are  applicable  principally  in  the  context  of
interpreting  statutes:  these  norms  -
here  referred  to  as  background
norms  -
often  seem  extratextual.  It is  useful  to  distinguish  between
the  invisible  norms  and  background  norms  because  usually  only  the
latter  are  controversial  and  constitute  the  subject  of  interpretive  dis-
putes.  The  distinction,  however,  is  imprecise,  for  interpretive  norms
often  serve  multiple  functions  simultaneously,  and  substantive  and
institutional  functions  are  served  by invisible  norms  as  well.

x.  Orientation to Meaning. -

Interpretive  principles  may  be  de-
signed  to  orient judicial  readers  to  the  text  in  order  to  help  them  to
ascertain  its  meaning  in  the  particular  case.  This  is  the  most  uncon-
troversial function  of interpretive  principles.  Most of these  "principles"
are  so  internalized  that  they  are  invisible  and  serve  as  an  ordinary
part  of  communication  itself.  They  operate  as  rules  of  syntax  or
grammar.

Some  of  these  syntactic  norms  have  been  explicitly  identified  as
guides  to  interpretation.  Consider,  for  example,  the  idea  that  the
language  of a  particular  provision  will  be  taken  in  the  context  of the
statute  as  a  whole  and  will  not be  interpreted  so  as  to  do  violence  to
the statutory  structure. 1 72  As  we  have seen  with  structural approaches
to  interpretation,  this  idea is  helpful  in  ascertaining  the  meaning  of  a
term  that,  if  understood  in  a  different  context,  would  be  ambiguous
or  indeed  would  have  a  "literal"  meaning  contrary  to  that  indicated
by  the  particular  setting.  Even  apparently  unambiguous  statutory
terms  might  have  a  counterintuitive  meaning  if  other  provisions  of

INTERPRETING STATUTES

the  statute  so  indicate. 173  The  same  considerations  support  the  prin-
ciple  that  statutory  provisions  should  be  read  so  as  not  to  create
internal  inconsistency  or  conflict  with  other  enactments, 174  and  the
idea  that,  where  there  is  a potential  conflict,  specific  provisions  should
prevail  over  general  terms  in  the  same  statute. 175

Many  of  the  infamous  Latin-phrased  canons  serve  similarly  mun-

dane  functions.  For  example,  the  principle  of  ejusdem  generis  -
where  general  words  follow  a specific  enumeration,  the general  words
should  be  limited  to  persons  or  things  similar  to  those  enumerated 176
-
derives  from  an  understanding  that  the  general  words  are  probably
not  meant  to  include  matters  entirely  far  afield  from  the  specific
enumeration.  If  understood  to  be  truly  general,  the  general  words
would  make  the  specific  enumeration  redundant.

A  more  controversial  example  is  the  principle  expressio unius  est
exclusio  alterius: to  include  one  thing  is  to  exclude  another.  Courts
sometimes  use  this  principle  when  Congress  has  specified  a  list  of
actors  entitled  to  something  -
say,  the  people  authorized  to  obtain
review  of  federal  administrative  action,  or  to  obtain  welfare  benefits
-
in  order  to  support  the  conclusion  that  those  not  specified  are  not
entitled  to  the  good  in  question. 177  The  assumption  is  that  by  ex-
pressly singling  out those  people  to  whom it wanted  to  grant the  good,
Congress  implicitly  decided  to  deny  all  others  the  good.  The  expressio
unius canon  should  not  be  used  mechanically.  The  failure  to  refer
explicitly  to  the  group  in  question  may  reflect  inadvertence,  inability
to reach  consensus,  or a decision  to  delegate  the  decision  to the courts,
rather  than  an  implicit  negative  legislative  decision  on  the  subject.
Moreover,  Congress  could  have  explicitly  solved  the  problem  by  spec-
ifying that  the  group  in  question  may  not receive  the  benefit,  and  the
availability  of  that  option  weakens  the  inference  that  silence  resolves

173  See,  e.g.,  Shell  Oil  Co.  v. Iowa  Dep't  of  Revenue,  io9 S.  Ct.  278,  282  (1988).  Suppose,
for  example,  that the question  is  whether  the term  "feasible"  requires  an  agency  to  weigh  costs
and benefits,  or instead  tells  the agency  to act  unless  the industry would  be seriously jeopardized
by the  regulation.  If  the word  "feasible"  is  used  in  the  same  sentence  or  provision  as  the term
"cost-benefit  analysis,"  then  it is  reasonable  to  assume  that  the  word  "feasible"  itself  does  not
call  for  cost-benefit  balancing  -

otherwise  the  statute  would  be  redundant  or  incoherent.

the  issue  against  the  group.  Sometimes,  however,  the  principle  is  a
helpful  way  of  discovering  statutory  meaning  in  a  particular  case. 178
When  it  is  plausible  to  assume  that  Congress  has  considered  all  the
alternatives,  the  legislative  failure  to  grant  authority  to  one  person
suggests  that it intended  to  deny  the relevant  authority  to  that person.
Although  particular  interpretive  principles  of  this  type  will  be
controversial,  many  of them  serve  the  time-honored  function  of help-
ing  to  discern  the  meaning  of the  statute  in  the  particular  case.

2.  Interpretive  Instructions. -

Interpretive  principles  may  also
serve  as  guides  to  what  might  be  called  the  interpretive  instructions
of  the  legislature.  The  goal  is  to  capture  an  actual  or  hypothetical
legislative  judgment  about  how  statutes  should  be  construed. 179  The
easiest  cases  involve  explicit  legislative  instructions  about  interpreta-
tion.  The  first  sections  of  the  United  States  Code  thus  set  out  such
instructions, 18 0  as  do  the  codes  of  other  countries. 18 1  Such  statutes
may  attempt  to  provide  substantive  guidance. 182

Some  interpretive  principles,  however,  are  a product  of  an  under-
standing  of implicit  rather  than  explicit legislative  interpretive  instruc-
tions.  For  example,  a  familiar  and  often  quite  important  principle  is
that  appropriations  measures  should  not  lightly  be  taken  to  amend
substantive  statutes. 183  That  principle  does  not  of  course  indicate
Congress'  specific  instructions  on  every bill.  Appropriations  measures
are  often  designed  to  amend  substantive  statutes.  As  a general  matter,
however,  this  norm  tracks  an  understanding  about  how  Congress
would  want  courts  to  interpret  appropriations  measures:  the  rules  of

178  Consider,  for  example,  United Steelworkers v.  Weber,  in  which  the  Court  was  asked  to
decide  whether  Congress  had  outlawed  voluntary  affirmative  action  by  prohibiting  racial  dis-
crimination.  See  443  U.S.  at  197. 
In  concluding  that  Congress  had  not  done  so,  the  Court
relied  on  the  fact  that  Congress  enacted  a provision  saying  that  it did  not  intend  to  "require"
race-conscious  decisions,  an  enactment  that  would  be  most  puzzling  if the  basic  antidiscrimi-
nation  principle  already  invalidated  affirmative  action.  See  id.  at  205-06.

179 As  noted,  Congress may  intend that the courts fill  gaps  or that  general  terms be  construed

in  accordance  with  contemporary  understandings.  See  supra pp.  421-22.

180 See  I  U.S.C.  §§  1-6  (1988);  see also R.  DICKERSON,  supra note  33,  at 262-81  (discussing
the  Uniform  Statutory  Construction  Act);  1A SUTHERLAND  ON  CONSTRUCTION,  supra note  176,
§ 27.03,  at 463-64  (discussing  state  interpretation  acts).

181  See,  e.g.,  DAs  ALLGEMEINE  BORGERLICHE  GESETZBUCH  §  7  (Aus.)  (instructing  judges
that  when  interpreting  an  ambiguous  code  provision,  they  should  look  to  the  purpose  of  the
statute,  to  analogous  cases,  and  finally  to  general  legal  principles);  C.C.D.F.  art.  9  (Mex.)
(presuming  that previous  laws are  not  repealed  unless a statute  expressly does so  or its  provisions
are  incompatible  with  the  previous  laws);  ZGB,  Cc,  Cc  art.  1(2)  (Switz.)  (instructing  a  judge
when  faced  with  a gap  in  the  code  to  apply  the customary  law  and,  if that  does  not resolve the
case,  to  place  himself  in the  role  of a legislator  and  decide  accordingly).

182  See,  e.g.,  CAL.  CIV.  PROC.  CODE  §  1866  (West  1983)  (instructing  judges  in  cases  of

ambiguity  to interpret  provisions in  favor  of "natural  right").

Hill,  437  U.S.  153,  190-9,  (1978).

INTERPRETING STATUTES

the  House  and  Senate  prohibit  substantive  lawmaking  through  appro-
priations. 184

Consider,  as  another  example,  the  idea  that  statutes  should  be
construed  to  avoid constitutional  invalidity. 185  Although  this  principle
does  not  attempt  to  discern  statutory  meaning  in  the  particular  case,
it  might  be  justified  as  an  accurate  reflection  of Congress'  likely  pref-
erence  for validation  rather  than  invalidation.18 6

3.  Improving Lawmaking: Institutional Considerations. - A  third
function  of  interpretive  principles  is  to  promote  better  lawmaking.
Some  principles,  for  example,  minimize  judicial  or  administrative  dis-
cretion,  or push legislative  processes  in  desirable directions.  The  effort
is  to  improve  lawmaking  processes  and  the  deliberation  and  account-
ability  that  are  supposed  to  accompany  them.  In  this  respect,  some
interpretive  principles  fulfill  goals  associated  with  the  separation  of
powers  and  with  plausible  assessments  of  comparative  institutional
competence.

The  "plain  meaning"  principle,  for  example,  might  be  an  effort
not  to  discover  what  Congress  meant  in  the  particular  case,  but
instead  to  tell  Congress  to  be  careful  with  statutory  language.  The
principle  warns  Congress  that  courts will  not guess  about  the  meaning
of  statutes  or  supply  remedies  for  language  that  leads  to  absurd  re-
sults. 187  The  hope  -
probably  a  false  one  -
is  that  the  principle
will  lead  Congress  to  express  itself  clearly  in the  future.  The  principle
also  helps  to  discipline  the  judiciary  by  warning  courts  not  to  imple-
ment  policies  of their  own  choosing.

Some  principles  designed  to  fulfill  institutional  goals  require  a
"clear  statement"  before  courts  will  interpret  a  statute  to disrupt  time-
honored  or  constitutionally  grounded  understandings  about  proper

184  See  HOUSE  OF  REPRESENTATIVES,  RULES  OF  THE  HOUSE  OF  REPRESENTATIVES,  H.R.
Doc.  No.  279,  99th  Cong.,  2d  Sess.  573-74  (1987)  (rule  XXI(2))  (prohibiting  provisions  or
amendments  in  general  appropriations  bills  that  change  existing  law);  COMMITTEE  ON  RULES
&  ADMIN.,  UNITED  STATES  SENATE,  STANDING  RULES  OF  THE  UNITED  STATES  SENATE  18
(Comm.  Print  1972)  (rule  16.4)  (same);  see  also  Devins,  Regulation of  Government  Agencies
Through  Limitation Riders, 1987  DUKE  L.J.  456,  458  (favoring  these  limitations).

185  See,  e.g.,  Communications  Workers  of  America  v.  Beck,  io8  S.  Ct.  2641,  2657  (1988);
Commodity  Futures  Trading  Comm'n  v.  Schor,  478  U.S.  833,  841  (1986);  NLRB  v.  Catholic
Bishop,  440  U.S.  490,  507  (1979);  American  Airways  Charters,  Inc.  v.  Regan,  746  F.2d  865,
867  (D.C. Cir.  1984).

186  This  norm  also  serves  other  purposes.  See  infra p.  459.
187  See,  e.g.,  Amoco  Prod.  Co.  v.  Village  of  Gambell,  480  U.S.  531,  546-48  (1987)  (refusing
to  find  that the  outer  continental  shelf is  in  Alaska  for  purposes of the Alaskan  National Interest
Lands  Conservation  Act);  Garcia  v.  United  States,  469  U.S.  70,  74  (1984)  (relying  on  plain
language  and  arguing  that it would  be  absurd  to  give  a statute  a  construction  that would  result
in  "a  federal  robbery statute  without jurisdiction");  Diamond v.  Chakrabarty,  447  U.S.  303,  308

of  statutory  language);  Tennessee  Valley  Auth.  v.  Hill,  437  U.S.  153,  173  (1978)  (refusing  to
exempt  federal  projects  from  the Endangered  Species  Act).

governmental  arrangements.  Clear-statement  principles  force  Con-
gress  expressly  to  deliberate  on  an  issue  and  unambiguously  to  set
forth  its  will;  they  commonly  appear  in  statutory  interpretation  as  a
subset  of  the  category  of  interpretive  norms.  Presumptions  in  favor
of state  autonomy, 18 8  of  noninterference  with  executive  power  in  for-
eign  affairs,' 8 9  and  of continued  judicial  power  to  balance  the  equi-
ties, 190  all  preserve  traditional  institutional  roles.  All  of  these  princi-
ples  are  designed  to  require  a  clear  statement  before  courts  will  find
congressional  displacement  of  the  usual  allocation  of  institutional  au-
thority.

The  principle  that  appropriations  measures  should  not  be  con-
strued  to  amend  substantive  statutes  also  has  an  institutional  function.
This  principle  is  designed  in  part  to  promote  responsible  lawmaking
by  ensuring  that  casual,  ill-considered,  or  interest-driven  measures  do
not  overcome  ordinary  statutes. 19 1  The  narrow  construction  of  ap-
propriations  measures  promotes  the  primacy  of  ordinary  lawmaking,
in  which  the  constellation  of  interests  is  quite  different  and  the  like-
lihood  of, deliberation  higher.

Similar  goals  are  served  by  the  idea  that  when  there  is  doubt,
statutes  should  be  construed  to  limit the  discretion  of regulatory  agen-
cies. 192  The  principle  in  favor  of  narrowing  discretion  works  against
regulatory  pathologies  produced  by  factional  power  or  self-interested
behavior  of bureaucrats.1 93  Also  in  this  category  are  the  notions  that
statutes 
construed
harmoniously1 94  and  that  courts  should  defer  to  interpretations  of  the
law  by  regulatory  agencies. 195  As noted  above,  this latter  idea,  prom-
inent  in  recent  cases, 19 6  is  often  defended  by  reference  to  a  judicial
belief that  when  statutes  have  ambiguities  or leave  gaps,  discretionary

INTERPRETING STATUTES

judgments  should  be  made  by the  relatively  more  accountable  agency
rather  than  by  courts.  That  substantive  value  judgment  cannot  be
traced  to  Congress.  It  is  a  judicial  construction  designed  to  promote
electoral  accountability  and  to  reduce  the  policymaking  discretion  of
judges. 197

4.  Substantive  Purposes. -

Finally,  interpretive  principles  may
serve  substantive  purposes  wholly  apart  from  statutory  meaning,  in-
terpretive  instructions,  or  the lawmaking  process.  These  functions  are
usually the  most  visible  and  the  most controversial.  Substantive  prin-
ciples  may  reflect  an  objectionable  judicial  value  judgment;  but  they
might  result  instead  from  policies  that  derive  from  the  Constitution
or  are  otherwise  easy  to  defend.

Interpretive  principles  are  often  a  product  of  constitutional
norms. 198  The  idea  that  when  a  statute  might  be  interpreted  to  be
constitutionally  valid  or  invalid,  courts  should  construe  it  so  that  it
survives  challenge,  vindicates  constitutionally  grounded  substantive
values;  it  also  reflects  probable  interpretive  instructions  and  promotes
superior  lawmaking.199  A  somewhat  broader  version  of  this  idea
would  suggest  that  where  statutes  might be  thought  to  raise  a  consti-
tutional  question,  they  should  be  construed  so  as  to  steer  clear  of
constitutional  doubt. 20 0  The  Constitution  provides  the  background
against  which  statutory  terms  are  read. 20 1

197  See  Chevron,  467  U.S.  at 865-66;  see  also Monaghan,  supra note  142  (discussing admin-

istrative  accountability).

198  Some of the substantive  interpretive principles  may be treated  as a  form  of "constitutional
common  law,"  in  which  courts,  responding  to  policies  having  a  kind  of  constitutional  status,
press  statutes  in  particular  directions.  See  Monaghan,  The  Supreme  Court,  1974  Term  -
Foreword: Constitutional Common Law,  89  HARv.  L.  REV.  i  (1975).

199 See,  e.g.,  Kent  v.  Dulles,  357  U.S.  ii6,  129  (1958);  Crowell  v.  Benson,  285  U.S.  22,  46

(1932).

200  See,  e.g.,  NLRB  v.  Catholic  Bishop,  440  U.S.  490,  507  (I979);  Church  of  the  Holy

Trinity v.  United  States,  143  U.S.  457,  461,  472  (1892).

201  Interpretive  principles  rooted in  constitutional  provisions help  account for  a large  number
of  other  decisions.  Consider,  for  example,  the  rule  of  lenity  in  criminal  law,  which  counsels
courts  to  construe  ambiguous  criminal  statutes  narrowly.  See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.  Campos-
Serrano,  404  U.S.  293,  297  (1971)  (requiring  clear  and  definite  language  before  choosing  the
harsher  of alternative  readings).  The  principle  is  rooted  in  due  process  notions,  which  require
clear  notice  before  the  imposition  of  criminal  liability.  Another  example  is  the  principle  that
congressional  statutes  should  not lightly  be  taken  to  preempt  state  law.  See,  e.g.,  Puerto  Rico
Dep't of Consumer  Affairs  v.  Isla Petroleum  Corp.,  io8  S.  Ct.  1350,  1355  (1988);  Ray v.  Atlantic

(defending the  anti-preemption  canon).  Also  rooted in  due  process is  the principle  that disfavors
the  retroactive  application  of statutes.  See  Bowen  v.  Georgetown  Univ. Hosp.,  109  S.  Ct. 468,

The frequently  invoked  idea  that  "remedial  statutes  should be  broadly  construed,"  see,  e.g.,
3  SUTHERLAND  ON  CONSTRUCTION,  supra note  176,  §  6O.Ol,  at  55-56,  however,  is  largely
useless.  All  statutes  are  in  a  sense  remedial,  and  it would  be  odd  to  suggest  that  all  statutes
should  be  broadly  construed.  The  principle  is  best  defended  as  a  necessary  corrective  to  the

Another  substantive  principle,  one  without  constitutional  founda-
tions  but  easily  defended,  holds  that  statutes  and  treaties  should,  in
the  face  of  ambiguity,  be  construed  favorably  to  Indian  tribes. 20 2
There  is  no  reason  to  think  that  this  notion  will  tend  accurately  to
describe  congressional  intent in particular  cases.  It is  instead  a judge-
made  rule  responding  to  obvious  disparities  in  bargaining  power  and
to  inequitable  treatment  of  Native  Americans  by  the  nation  in  the
past.  Other  substantive  norms  counsel  courts  not  to  infer  private
causes  of action  from  regulatory  statutes, 20 3  to  assume  that  legislation
of  Congress  applies  only  within  the  territorial  jurisdiction  of  the
United  States, 20 4  not  to imply  exemptions  from  taxation, 20 5  to  assume
that  criminal  statutes  require  mens  rea, 20 6 to  avoid irrationality, 20 7  to
counteract  obsolescence, 20 8  and  to  protect  common  law  rights  in  the
absence  of a  clear  statement  from  Congress. 20 9

C.  An  Alternative Method:
The  Agency  Theory  of the Judicial Role  Reconsidered

The  functions  played  by  background  norms  suggest  an  alternative
to  the  conventional  understandings  of statutory  interpretation,  an  al-
ternative  that  explains  both  the  substantial  areas  of  agreement  and
the  nature  of  interpretive  disputes.  On  this  account,  the  statutory
text  is  the  starting  point,  but  it  becomes  intelligible  only  because
interpretive  norms  give  it  content.  In  most  cases,  the  text,  together
with widely  shared background  norms,  will  be unambiguous.  In  other
cases,  the  text  alone  will  produce  doubt,  but  a  careful  consideration
of the  context,  structure,  purpose,  and  legislative  history  of  a statute
will  lead  to  a  single  conclusion.  In  the  remaining  cases,  the  history
will  itself be ambiguous  or will reflect  the work  of an unrepresentative,
self-interested  group;  the  "purpose"  of  a  multimember  body  will  be
impossible  to  characterize;  and  other  contextual  considerations  will  be
unhelpful.  In  these  hard  cases,  faced  with  the  familiar  problems  of
ambiguity,  overinclusiveness,  underinclusiveness,  and  gaps,  courts
must  resort  to  more  conspicuous  background  norms.

canon  calling  for  narrow  construction  of  statutes  in  derogation  of  the  common  law.  The  legal
system  would  be  better  off without  either  canon.

INTERPRETING STATUTES

Many  of  these  cases  will  involve  norms  that  are  visible  but  not
controversial;  others  will  involve  the  application  of  norms  that  are
both.  Such  norms  serve  the  full  range  of  interpretive  functions.  In
the  most controversial  cases,  they  are  intended  to  improve  lawmaking
or  to  further  substantive  policies.  Sometimes  the  goals  motivating
these  norms  are  disputable  -
consider  the  protection  of  federalism,
the  rule  of  lenity,  the  protection  of Native  Americans  -
and  some-
times  it is  unclear  how  well  the  particular  principle  serves  those  goals.
In  hard  cases,  however, the  dispute  is  over  the  background  principles,
not the  dictionary  meaning  of  the  words.  Although  it is  tempting  to
see  the  use  of  such  principles  as  a  controversial  intrusion  of  "value
judgments" or "policy concerns"  into  the  process  of legal interpretation,
this  view  misconceives  the  nature  of  statutory  construction.  As  we
have  seen,  norms  of this  sort are  an  indispensable  part of the  process
of deriving  meaning  from  text.

The  challenge  is,  first,  to  identify  norms  on  which  participants  in
the  legal  culture  do  or might  agree  and,  second,  to  generate  principles
under  which  conflicting  norms  can  be  reconciled.  Inevitably  that task
will be  highly value-laden.  It is impossible  to select  interpretive  norms
without  assessing  their  role  in  improving  or  impairing  the  operation
of  statutory  law.2 10  The  choice  of  norms  will  call  for  judgments  of
value  and  policy  precisely  to  the  considerable  extent  that  formalist
approaches  to  statutory  construction  are  incomplete  or  unacceptable.
It  follows  that  the  interpretive  norms  will  be  defensible  only  to  the
extent  that  good  substantive  and  institutional  arguments  can  be  ad-
vanced  on  their  behalf.

Undertaken  properly,  however,  the task-of  developing  interpretive
norms  will  not  amount  to  an  unanchored  or  entirely  open-ended  in-
quiry  into  the  best  outcomes  in  particular  cases.  Even  when  the
traditional  sources  of  interpretation  leave  gaps,  courts  should  not
resolve  cases  merely  by  deciding  what  result  would  in  their  view  be
best,  all  things  considered.  Instead,  the legal  culture  should  be  taken
to  impose  a  degree  of  constraint  on  the  selection  of  the  governing
principles.  For example,  we  have  seen  that  a broad private  autonomy
norm  is  unacceptable  largely  because  of  its  inconsistency  with  the
fabric  of  the  modern  regulatory  state;  the  same  would  be  true  for  a
norm  in  favor  of,  say,  communism  or  fascism.  Moreover,  some  in-
terpretive  principles  -
for  example,  the  idea  that  statutes  should  be
interpreted  favorably  to  the  Indian tribes  or so  as  not to  override  state
law  -
are  so  well-established  that  they  have  the  status  of precedent.
Of  course,  the  decision  to  follow  such  constraints  must  itself  be  jus-
tified  on  normative  grounds.  But there  are  good  institutional  reasons

210  As  we  have  seen,  even  the  most  formalist  approaches  must  resort  to  such  norms,  but

often  at a  high  level  of  abstraction  and without  acknowledgment.  See  supra pp.  416-24.

to  require  courts  to  use  principles  that  are  consistent  both  with  the
modern  regulatory  state  and  with  existing  interpretive  norms  -
at
least  if the existing  norms  are  not anachronistic 2 11  and if  the  state  and
the  norms  are  not themselves  conspicuously  irrational  or  unjust.

We  are left,  then,  with  the task of generating  interpretive  principles
a  task  that  does  not amount  to  an  open-ended  search  for  the  right
results  in  particular  cases,  that  faces  some  serious  constraints,  but
that has  a  significant  normative  or  evaluative  dimension.  If  properly
executed,  that  task  will  significantly  increase  the  candor  and  clarity
of  interpretation,  by  making  the  relevant  norms  explicit  and  well-
ordered  rather  than  invisible  and  ad  hoc.  The  resulting  system  will
also  make  it  easier  to  understand  the  actual  dynamics  of  the  interpre-
tive  process;  provide  a  clear  and  structured  background  against which
Congress,  administrators,  and  courts  can  do  their  work;  and  increase
the  likelihood  of  legislative  or  public  correction  of  outmoded  or  un-
justified  norms.  Finally,  in  hard  cases,  such  an  approach  will  give
rationality  and  justice  the  benefit  of  the  doubt,  while  furnishing  rel-
atively  concrete  guidance  for  unpacking  those  concepts.

IV.  INTERPRETIVE  PRINCIPLES  FOR  THE  REGULATORY  STATE

Background  norms  vary  from  one  country  to  another;  they  also
vary  from  one  period  to  another  within  any  particular  country.  In
the  United  States,  for  example,  the  principles  of  the  late  nineteenth
and  early twentieth centuries  reflected  a belief in  common law  ordering
that  was  largely  repudiated  in  the  1930S.212  In  the  Warren  Court
period,  the  background  norms  differed  from  those  that  prevailed  in
the  Burger  Court  era  and  those  that  operate  today. 2 13

211  See  infra p.  480 (calling for judicial  consideration of systemic  effects to  promote  rationality
in  regulation);  infra pp.  48o-8i  (calling  for  abandonment  of  private  law  principles  when  they
are  inconsistent  with public  law  goals).

212  See  supra p.  408.
213  See  generally Note,  Intent,  Clear Statements, and the  Common Law: Statutory Interpre-
tation  in  the  Supreme  Court,  95  HARV.  L.  REv.  892  (1982).  Consider,  for  example, 
the
dramatically  shifting  reaction  to  implied causes  of  action.  Compare J.I.  Case  Co.  v.  Borak,  377
U.S.  426  (1964)  (willingly  creating  such  actions)  with  Touche  Ross  &  Co.  v.  Redington,  442
U.S.  560  (r979)  (requiring  affirmative  evidence  of a  congressional  intent to  create  implied  causes
of  action).  Consider  also  the  Court's  increasing  reluctance  to  find  federal  preemption  of  state
law,  see  Note,  The  Preemption Doctrine: Shifting Perspectives on  Federalism and  the Burger
Court,  75  COLUM.  L.  REv.  623  (1975),  and  the  increasingly  narrow  interpretation  of  statutes
protecting  disadvantaged  groups,  compare  Griggs  v.  Duke  Power  Co.,  410  U.S.  424  (1971)
(interpreting  title  VII  to  require  only proof  of  disparate  impact)  with Wards  Cove  Packing  Co.
v. Atonio,  109  S.  Ct.  2115  (1989)  (limiting  use  of  statistical  evidence  and  placing  the burden  of
proof  on  plaintiff  at  all  times).  In  all  of  these  areas,  the  source  of  the  disagreement  is  not  the
"text" -
but instead  a  dispute
over  which  interpretive  norms  should  be  applied  when  the  traditional  sources  of  statutory
construction  leave  gaps  or ambiguities.

INTERPRETING STATUTES

Despite  the  shift  in  the  New  Deal  period,  courts  have  continued
to  use institutional  and substantive  norms that are  a legacy of common
law  understandings.  Those  norms  seem  to  have  taken  on  a  life  of
their  own;  indeed  they  appear  invisible  to  those  who  rely  on  them.
Sometimes,  however,  these  norms  conflict  with  the  values  that  under-
lie  the modern  regulatory  state,  or they otherwise  impair governmental
performance. 2 14  A  task  for the  future  is  to  design  background  norms
that  are  well-adapted  to  contemporary  conceptions  of the  relationship
between  the  citizen  and  the  state  and  that  are  rooted  in  a  solid
understanding  of the  purposes  and  pathologies  of regulation.

Outside  of  law,  and  to  some  extent  within  the  legal  academy,  it
has  become  fashionable  to  suggest  that  interpretive  disputes  are  re-
solved  on  the  basis  of  agreements  within  a  community  of  interpret-
ers. 2 15  It  should  be  clear  by  now  that  the  central  tasks  here  -
description  and  prescription  -
require  far more,  especially  in  light of
the  fact  that  the  community  will  frequently  be  divided. 
In  these
circumstances,  the  task  is  to  locate  the  sources  of  interpretive  princi-
ples  and  to  identify  those  that  deserve  general  respect. 2 16

In  this  Part,  I  attempt to  carry  out  that  task  by outlining  a  series
of institutional  and  substantive  principles  designed  to  promote  consti-
tutional  purposes  and  to  improve  the  operation  of  deliberative  gov-
ernment  in  the  post-New  Deal  period.  All  of the  principles  have  at
least  some  basis  in  current  law,  with  some  more  firmly  rooted  than
others.  My  goal,  however,  is  not solely  descriptive.  All  of the  prin-
ciples  described  here  have  justifications  deriving  from  the  constitu-
tional  backdrop,  the  promotion  of  sound  institutional  arrangements,

214 See  infra pp.  480-81.  A  similar  problem  arises  from  the  use  of  principles  that reflect  a
poor  understanding  of  the  operation  of  regulatory  law,  including  above  all  misconceptions  of
the probabilistic character  of regulatory injuries and of the complex  systemic  effects  of regulation.
See  infra p.  480.

215  See  S.  FISH,  DOING  WHAT  COMES  NATURALLY,  supra note  18;  S.  FISH,  Is  THERE  A
TEXT  IN  THIS  CLASS?,  supra note  18;  Fiss,  Conventionalism, 58  S.  CAL.  L.  REV.  177  (1985);
Fiss,  Objectivity  and  Interpretation, 34  STAN.  L.  REV.  739,  745  (I982).  The  disagreement
between  Fish  and Fiss -
involving  the degree  of "constraint" imposed  by rules  of interpretation
-
should  not  disguise  the  substantial  overlap  in  their  positions;  both  advert  to  convention  as
the  basic  source  of  interpretation  and  argue  that  those  who  undertake  or  evaluate  interpretive
practices  must  be  content  with  invoking  agreed-upon  background  principles.

216  The  development  of  defensible  background  norms,  and  of  criteria  of  this  sort,  would
furnish  a  decisive  response  to  those  who  view  legal  texts  as  inevitably  indeterminate  or  who
refuse  to  engage  in  the  process  of evaluating  competing  conceptions  of meaning.  See  supra pp.
441-42.

"Deconstruction"  within  the  law  - which  attempts  to  draw  on  the work  of Derrida,  see,
e.g.,  J.  DERRIDA,  OF  GRAMMATOLOGY  (G.  Spivak  trans.  1976),  but usually  amounts  in practice
to  quite  ordinary  efforts  at undermining  a  particular  line  of reasoning  -
is  inadequate  in large
part  because  it fails  to  account for  interpretive  norms  and  criteria.  In law  and elsewhere,  texts
have  relatively  fixed  meanings  because  of shared  interpretive  principles.  Even  where  meaning
is  contested,  standards  for  mediating  among  conflicting  views  can  be  discussed  and  evaluated.

and  the  prevention  of  statutory  irrationality  and  injustice.  I  outline
the  relevant  justifications  while  discussing  the  norms.

In  general,  these  principles  are  not  designed  to  allow  courts  to
depart  from  the  approach  prescribed  by the  agency  conception  of the
judicial  role  where  that  approach  leaves  no  ambiguity.  In  easy  cases,
the  agency  conception  leads  - with  the  inevitable  aid  of  generally
shared  interpretive  principles  -
to  a  clear  result.  The  principles
discussed  in  this  Part are  intended  both  as  guides  to  statutory meaning
and  to  fill  gaps.  Politically  contestable  background  principles  do  not
provide  a  license  for  courts  to  ignore  the  otherwise  clear  meaning  of
the  statute.  Sometimes,  however,  these  principles  will  call  for  a more
aggressive  judicial  role  -
requiring  a  clear  legislative  statement,  for
example,  before  interpreting  congressional  action  to  have  violated
constitutional  norms  or  to  have  produced  irrationality. 2 17

A.  Sources and Scope  of Interpretive Principles

z.  The Domain of Institutional and Substantive Norms. - Because
this  Part  considers  cases  in  which  the  traditional  sources  of  meaning
do  not  yield  a  single  answer,  I  focus  on  norms  that  read  legislative
instructions  in  light  of  institutional  or  substantive  concerns.  Norms
that  perform  the  other  two  functions  -
orientation  to  meaning  or
capturing  interpretive  instructions  -
are  not considered,  except  to  the
extent  that  norms  serving  institutional  or  substantive  functions  also
serve  those  functions.  In  focusing  on  institutional  and  substantive
norms,  an  initial  question  arises:  when  should  they  be  applied?

In  easy  cases,  substantive  and  institutional  norms  often  seem  un-
necessary,  and  norms  serving  syntactic  functions  - mostly  those  so
widely  shared  that  they  need  not  be  identified  -
appear  sufficient  to
resolve  the  case.  But  substantive  and  institutional  norms  are  ubiq-
uitous.  Consider  a  federal  environmental  statute  that  allegedly
preempts  all  of  state  tort  law.  The  reason  that  it  does  not  do  so  is
not syntax  alone,  but syntax  along  with,  and  indeed inseparable  from,
a wide  range  of agreed-upon  substantive  and  institutional  understand-
ings  about,  among  other  things,  the  limited  preemptive  effect  of  fed-
eral  enactments  and  the  appropriate  role  of the  judiciary.

217  My  discussion  of background  norms  is directed  in  particular  to  courts  seeking  to  discern
statutory  meaning.  Its  implications  do,  however,  extend  to  other  institutions,  including  regu-
latory agencies  and  Congress  itself.  In  the first instance,  agencies are  charged  with  interpreting
and  enforcing  their  statutory  mandates,  and  administrative, practice  inevitably  involves  inter-
pretation,  with  all  the  necessary  reliance  upon  background  norms.  Moreover,  ideas  about  the
constitutional  backdrop,  the  institutional  practice,  and  statutory  function  and  failure  influence
legislative  drafting.  Ultimately,  a  system  of  interpretive  norms  aims  to  describe  the  nature  of
modern  social  and  economic  regulation,  and  to  suggest  the  ways  in  which  national  institutions
might  improve  its  performance  -
a goal  that  reaches  far  beyond  the  topic  of  statutory  inter-
pretation.

INTERPRETING STATUTES

For  these  reasons,  no  cases  can  be  resolved  without  reference  to
norms  having  substantive  and  institutional  functions.  But  sometimes
syntax  or  interpretive  instructions,  accompanied  by  other  norms  on
which  there  is  a  wide  consensus,  are  so  clear  that  it would  be  wrong
or  unnecessary  to  introduce  controversial  substantive  or  institutional
norms.  This  is  a more  precise formulation  of the  usually  correct claim
that substantive  norms  should not be  permitted  to  override  "the text."
Young  v.  Community Nutrition Institute2 18  provides  an  instructive
example.  Congress  has instructed  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration
(FDA) that  when  dangerous  substances  are  required  in the  preparation
of food,  "the Secretary  shall promulgate regulations limiting the quan-
tity  therein or  thereon  to  such  extent  as  he finds  necessary for the
protection of public health,  and  any  quantity  exceeding  the  limits  so
fixed  shall  also  be  deemed  to  be  unsafe." 2 19  In  Young,  the  FDA  was
asked  to  regulate  the  quantity  of aflatoxin,  a  carcinogenic  substance.
Because  "to  such  extent  as he  finds  necessary"  follows  "thereon" rather
than  "regulations,"  the  syntax  of  the  provision  suggests  that  when
dangerous  substances  are  required  in  the  production  of  food,  the
Secretary  must promulgate  regulations setting a tolerance  level.  Under
this  reading,  the  words  "to  such  extent  as  he  finds  necessary"  allow
the  Secretary  discretion  to  decide  on  the  tolerance  level  but  do  not
confer  on  him  discretion  not to  promulgate  regulations  at  all. 220  Al-
though  perhaps  not  compelled  by  the  text,  this  reading  is  strongly
supported  by the fact that an interpretation  conferring on  the  Secretary
discretion  not  to  issue  regulations  would  make  the  entire  provision
unnecessary.  The  discretion  to  promulgate  or  not  already  belonged  to
him.

The  Supreme  Court,  however,  invoked  the  principle  of deference
to  agency  interpretations  of  law  in  order  to  uphold  the  FDA's  view
that  the  statute  allows  the  Secretary  not to  promulgate  regulations. 22 1
This  decision  may  be  taken as  an  example  of a case  wrongly  invoking
a  contestable  institutional  norm -
deference  to  agency  interpretations
-
in  a  context  in  which  syntax  and  structure  alone,  accompanied  by
agreed-upon  background  norms,  led  to  a single  answer.

In  other  settings,  however,  norms  that  go  to  syntax  or  to  interpre-
tive  instructions,  even  accompanied  by generally  held institutional  and
substantive  understandings,  will  lead  to  uncertainty,  to  irrationality,
or  to  an  intrusion  on  constitutionally  grounded  arrangements.  Con-
spicuous  or  contestable  norms  should  be  invoked  only  in  narrowly
defined  settings:  to  "break  ties";  to  require  a  clear  statement  before

reaching  an  outcome  that  would  be  absurd  or  would  intrude  upon
constitutionally  grounded  arrangements;  to  fill  a  gap  or  respond  to  a

face  of  changed  circumstances  or  the  apparently  irrational  results  of

2.  Sources: In  General. -

Institutional  and  substantive  norms  are
of  course  value-laden,  and  the  choice  among  them  is  a  subject  of
disagreement.  Nevertheless,  it is  possible  to identify sources  of values,
and  values  themselves,  that  are  or  deserve  to  be  widely  shared.  The
first and most  straightforward  source  is the  Constitution.  Understand-
ings  about  constitutional  arrangements  provide  a  significant  amount
of  the  background  against  which  statutory  construction  occurs.  To
be  sure,  constitutional  meaning  is  frequently  uncertain,  and  statutory
disputes  are  sometimes,  in  part,  a function  of a broader  dispute  about
the  best  way to  characterize  the constitutional  backdrop.  Often,  how-
ever,  there  is  sufficient  consensus  about  the  meaning  of  the  Consti-
tution  to  ground  a  large  part  of  interpretation.  When  no  such  con-
sensus  exists,  the  position  one  takes  will  be  a  function  of  a  more
narrowly  held  account  of  what  the  Constitution  requires.  Whether
the  position  is  persuasive  depends  on  the  reasons  that  can  be  mar-
shaled  on  behalf  of that  account.

The  second  source  of  interpretive  norms  -
also  straightforward
-
consists  of  understandings  about  how  statutory  interpretation  will
improve  or  impair  the  performance  of  governmental  institutions.
Some  such  understandings  are  a firmly  rooted  and  probably  unavoid-
able  part  of  interpretation.  One  might,  for  example,  conclude  that
legislative  history,  produced  by private  groups  and  never  enacted,  is
entitled  to  little weight;  or  that appropriations  statutes,  written  hastily
and  without  deliberation,  should  be  narrowly  construed.  If one  were
simply  describing  statutory  construction  as  it  is  currently  practiced,
one  would  find  a  number  of  background  norms  traceable  to  under-
standings  of precisely  this  sort.

The  third  and  final  source  of  background  norms  is  more  complex;
it  emerges  from  the  intended  functions  of regulatory  statutes  and  the
ways  in  which  such  statutes  fail  in  practice.  An  understanding  of
statutory  function  and  failure  -
is  in-
dispensable  not only  to  an  appreciation  of modern  law,  but  also  to  an
understanding  of  statutory  construction.  In  hard  cases,  the  familiar
notion  that  statutes  should  be  construed  so  as  not  to  produce  absurd

curiously  neglected  topics  -

(refusing  to attribute  to  Congress  the  intent  to  dictate  absurd  results);  Green  v.  Bock  Laundry

INTERPRETING STATUTES

or  irrational  results  is  too  abstract  to  be  helpful;  one  needs  a  partic-
ularized  understanding  of  regulatory  statutes.  A  detailed  discussion
of these  points  would  be  well  beyond  the  scope  of this  Article, 223  but
a  brief  outline  will  be  useful.

The  goals  of statutory  regimes  span  a wide  range.  Some  statutes
are  designed  to  promote  economic  efficiency,  others  to  redistribute
resources  in  public-regarding  ways,  to  protect future  generations from
irreversible  losses,  to  reflect  nonmarket  values  or aspirations,  to  coun-
teract the  social  subordination  of disadvantaged  groups,  or  to  enforce
the  terms  of  pure  interest-group  deals.  Moreover,  statutes  fail  for  a
number  of  different  reasons. 224  Some  are  flawed  in  conception  as  a
result  of  interest-group  power,  collective  action  problems, 225  the  ab-
sence  of political  accountability  or  political  deliberation,  changed  cir-
cumstances  or  obsolescence,  or  lack  of  coordination  with  other  stat-
utes.  Other  statutes  fail  because  of  implementation  problems.  For
example,  a  regulation  may  be  based  on  a  poor  understanding  of the
way  that  the  market  can  nullify  its  intended  effects. 2 26  Legislation
apparently  intended  to  protect  consumers,  workers,  or  tenants  may
have  undesirable  and  unintended  consequences. 22 7  Finally,  statutes
designed  to  reduce  or  eliminate  the  social  subordination  of disadvan-
taged  groups,  or  to  promote  public  values  like  environmental  quality
and  the  protection  of  endangered  species,  frequently  encounter  in  the
implementation  process  the  same  obstacles  -

224  If it were  possible,  it would  be extremely  valuable  to establish  a  tight connection  between
identifiable  statutory  functions  and  particular  forms  of  statutory  failure.  Any  such  enterprise
faces  serious  obstacles.  The  empirical  work  on  the  consequences  of  social  and  economic  regu-
lation  remains  primitive.  For  a  review,  see  C.  SUNSTEIN,  cited  above  in  note  *,  ch.  3.  For
helpful  work  in  this  area,  see  SENATE  COMM.  ON  GOVERNMENTAL  AFFAIRS,  96TH  CONG.,  2D
SESS.,  BENEFITS  OF  ENVIRONMENTAL,  HEALTH,  AND  SAFETY  REGULATION  (Comm.  Print
198o);  R.  CRANDALL,  CONTROLLING  INDUSTRIAL  POLLUTION  (1983);  R. CRANDALL,  H.  GRUEN-
SPECHT,  I.  KEELER  &  L.  LAVE,  REGULATING  THE  AUTOMOBILE  (1986);  K.  MEIER,  REGULA-

In  any  case,  an
assessment  of  those  consequences  cannot  depend  on  empirical  work  alone;  it must  also  rest on
some  ideas,  normative  in  character, about  what a  well-functioning  regulatory  system would  look
like.

lems,  the  unrepresented  character  of  future  generations,  and  other
disparities  in  political  influence  -
that  make  such  statutes  necessary
in  the  first place. 2 28  Government  failure  rfiimics  market  failure.

Although  conclusions  of  this  sort  are  principally  of  interest  to
officials  in  the  legislative  and  executive  branches,  they  are  relevant  to
the  judiciary  as  well.  Judicial  conceptions  of the  likely  function  and
potential  failure  of regulatory  statutes  inevitably  shape  legal  interpre-
tation.  Moreover,  such  understandings  will  likely  improve  interpre-
tation,  for  a  sensitivity  to  regulatory  failure  can  aid  courts  in  pro-
moting legislative  goals  in  the  face  of textual  ambiguities.  Recognizing
that conflicts  among  the principles  will  exist in  some  settings,  I discuss
rules  of  priority  and harmonization  below.

B.  The  Principles

i.  Constitutional Norms.  - Many  constitutional  norms  deserve  a
prominent  place  in  statutory  interpretation.  Some  of them  have  been
mentioned  in  Part  I.  The  central  point  is  that  the  Constitution
provides  the  backdrop  against  which  statutes  are  written  and  inter-
preted,  and  it furnishes  the  basic  assumptions  of  interpretation.

Federal  courts  underenforce  many  constitutional  norms,  and  for
good  reasons.  Institutional  constraints  - most  notably,  limited  fact-
finding  capability  and  attenuated  electoral  accountability  - make
courts  reluctant  to  vindicate  constitutional  principles  with  the  vigor
appropriate 
to  governmental  bodies  with  a  better  democratic  and
policymaking  pedigree.  As  a  result,  there  is  a  gap  between  what  the
Constitution  actually  requires  and  what  constitutional  courts  are  will-
ing  to  require  the  political  branches  of  government  to  do.  In  this
context,  courts  should  recognize  that  some  statutes  respond  to  Con-
gress'  constitutional  responsibilities  even  if  courts  would  not,  for  in-
stitutional  reasons,  require  Congress  to  carry  out those  responsibilities
in  the  first  instance.  Relatively  aggressive  statutory  construction  -
pushing  statutes  away  from  constitutionally  troublesome  ground  -
provides  a  way  for  courts  to  vindicate  constitutionally  based  norms
and  does  so  in  a  way  that  is  less  intrusive  than  constitutional  adju-
dication. 2 29

(a) Avoiding  Constitutional Invalidity  and Constitutional Doubts.
- The  principle  that  statutes  should  be  construed  so  as  to  survive

228  See,  e.g.,  K.  BUMILLER,  THE  CIVIL  RIGHTS  SocIETY  (I988)  (discussing  barriers  to
enforcement  of  civil  rights  laws);  Wood,  Does  Politics Make  a Difference  at  the  EEOC?,  34
Am.  J.  POL.  Sci.  (forthcoming  i9go)  (arguing  that  politics  does  make  a  difference  in  the
enforcement  of  civil rights).

229  Cf.  Sager,  supra  note  155  (arguing  that  Congress  and  state  courts  should  be  allowed  to
enforce  constitutional  norms  to  their  fullest  extent).  One  might  accept  this  general  point  while
acknowledging  the  highly  controversial  nature  of  particular  views  about  which  constitutional
norms  are  underenforced.

INTERPRETING STATUTES

constitutional  challenge  serves  a  number  of  functions:  it  is  a  natural
outgrowth  of the  system  of separation  of powers;  it  minimizes  inter-
branch  conflict;  it responds  to  Congress'  probable  preference  for  val-
idation  over  invalidation  ("implicit  interpretive  instructions");  and  it
strengthens  judicially  underenforced  constitutional  norms.  The  mild
statutory  "bending" that  sometimes  occurs  is  legitimate,  for courts  are
not  mere  agents  of the  enacting  legislature  but  have  an  obligation  to
the  citizenry  and the  legal  system  as  a  whole.

This  basic  idea  supports  the  broader  principle,  reflected  in  many
cases,  that  courts  should  construe  statutes  to  avoid  not  only  consti-
tutional  invalidity  but  also  constitutional  doubts. 230  This  latter  prin-
ciple  calls  for  a  far  more  aggressive  judicial  posture  in  statutory
construction,  one  that  allows  judicial  "bending"  of  a  greater  range  of
statutes.  Judge  Posner  criticizes  this  principle  on  the  ground  that  it
furnishes  a  kind  of  "judge-made  'penumbra"'  around  the  Constitu-
tion, 23 1  by  allowing  courts  to  press  statutes  in  particular  directions
even  though  they  would  ultimately  be  found  not  to  offend  the  Con-
stitution.

Judge  Posner's  objection  becomes  less  forceful,  however,  in  light
of the  fact  that  constitutional  norms  are  often  underenforced.  As  we
have seen,  there  is  a difference  between  what the Constitution  requires
and  what  the Supreme  Court,  interpreting  the Constitution,  is  willing
to  compel.  The aggressive  construction  of questionable  but not invalid
statutes  -
removing  them  from  the  terrain  of  constitutional  uncer-
tainty  -
is  a  less  intrusive  way  of vindicating  norms  that  do  in  fact
have  constitutional  status.

(b)  Federalism. -

In  the  system  of American  public law,  the  basic
assumption  is  that  states  have  authority  to  regulate  their own  citizens
and  territory.  This  assumption  justifies  an  interpretive  principle  re-
quiring  a  clear  statement  before  judges  will  find  federal  preemption
of  state  law.23 2  Although  no  substitute  for  an  inquiry  into  the  rela-
tionship  between  state  and  federal  law  in  the  particular  context,  this
principle  will  frequently  aid  interpretation  in  disputed  cases.

(c)  Political Accountability; Checks  and  Balances; the  Nondele-
gation Principle. - Some  interpretive  norms represent  constitutionally
inspired  efforts  to  promote  a  sound  allocation  of institutional  respon-
sibility.  Courts  hesitate  to  interpret  statutes  as  intruding  on  the  Pres-
ident's  power in  foreign  affairs, 233  or as interfering  with judicial  power
to  "balance  the  equities" in  cases involving  possible  injunctive  relief. 234

230  See,  e.g.,  NLRB  v.  Catholic  Bishop,  440  U.S.  490  (1979).
231  See  R.  POSNER,  supra note  io,  at  285.
232  See,  e.g.,  Puerto  Rico  Dep't  of  Consumer  Affairs  v.  Isla  Petroleum  Corp., 

iOS  S.  Ct.

234  See  Weinberger  v.  Romero-Barcelo,  456  U.S.  305,  319  (1982).  This  idea,  however,  is

vulnerable  in  the  post-New  Deal  era.  See  infra pp.  480-81.

HARVARD  LAW  REVIEW

[Vol.  103:405

Other  interpretive  strategies  can  be  similarly  understood.  For  ex-
ample,  courts  have,  since  the  New  Deal,  permitted  Congress  to  del-
egate  exceptionally  broad  policymaking  authority  to  regulatory  agen-
cies.  Such broad  delegations  were  at one  time thought  to offend  article
I  of  the  Constitution,  which  vests  legislative  power  in  Congress. 235
In  recent  years,  courts  have  been  reluctant  to  enforce  the  nondelega-
tion  doctrine.  This  reluctance  is  partly  attributable  to  the  difficulty
of  developing  standards  for  distinguishing  between  prohibited  and
permissible  delegations,  partly  a  product  of  the  intrusiveness  of  any
such judicial role,  and  partly a result of the  frequent  existence  of good
reasons  for  the  delegation  of  discretionary  power  to  regulatory  agen-
cies. 23 6  Through  statutory  construction,  however,  courts  are  some-
times  able  to  vindicate  the  constitutional  principle  against  delegation
of  legislative  authority.  They  can  do  so,  for  example,  by  narrowly
construing  grants  of policymaking  power. 23 7

Various  doctrines  dealing  with  the  degree  of judicial  deference  to
agency  interpretations  promote  principles  of  nondelegation,  account-
ability,  and  checks  and  balances.  For  example,  the  controversial
proposition  that  courts  should  interpret  congressional  enactments  on
their  own,  without  deferring  to  agency  constructions,  is  intended  to
avoid  the  delegation  problem  that  would  arise  if administrators  could
interpret  the  scope  of  their  own  authority.  It  is  bad  enough  for
administrators  to  have  broad  lawmaking  power;  the  problem  is  ag-
gravated  if administrators  can judge  the  scope of whatever  constraints
Congress  has  imposed  on  them.  As  we  have  seen,  courts  should  not
permit foxes  to  guard  henhouses. 238  The  exceptionally  important  idea
that  a  delegation  of  power  to  an  administrator  implicitly  permits
presidential  supervision  and control  similarly  tries  to  promote  political
accountability. 2 39  This  idea  promotes  the  constitutionally  grounded

235  See,  e.g.,  A.L.A.  Schechter  Poultry  Corp.  v.  United  States,  295  U.S.  495,  529-42  (1935);

Panama  Refining  Co.  v.  Ryan,  293  U.S.  388,  421  (1935).

236  See  Mistretta  v.  United  States,  iog  S.  Ct.  647,  654-58  (1989).  See  generally  Stewart,

supra note  144,  at  1693-97  (criticizing  attempts  to  revive  the  nondelegation  doctrine).

237  Cf. Hampton  v. Mow Sun  Wong,  426 U.S.  88  (1976)  (holding as a  matter  of constitutional
law that aliens  could  only  be  prevented  from  serving  as  federal  employees  by  a  decision  of the
President  or  the Congress  but  not the Civil  Service  Commission).  In  other  cases,  the  Court has
suggested  that  the  Constitution  permits  certain  disabilities  to  be  imposed  on  groups  only when
an  accountable  actor  has  so  decided.  The  most celebrated  example  is  Kent v.  Dulles,  357  U.S.
ii6  (1958),  in  which  the  Supreme  Court  concluded  that  the  Secretary  of State  may not  deny  a
passport to  a  member  of the  Communist  Party unless  Congress  clearly  authorized  him  to  do  so.
Decisions  of  this sort  impose  a "clear-statement" principle  to  the effect  that important  decisions
are  to be  made  by  accountable  actors  and  that  only a  clear  statement  to  the  contrary  will  rebut
this  presumption.

INTERPRETING STATUTES

goals  of  a  unitary  executive  branch:  centralization,  expedition,  and
accountability  in  law  enforcement. 240

(d)  The  Rule  of Law.  -

In  interpreting  statutes,  courts  employ  a
clear-statement  principle  in  favor  of  the  "rule  of  law":  a  system  in
which  legal  rules  exist,  are  clear  rather  than  vague,  do  not  apply
retroactively,  operate  in  the  world  as  they  do  in  the  books,  and  do
not  contradict  each  other. 24 1  The  due  process  clause  provides  a con-
stitutional  basis  for  the  rule  of  law  ideal. 2 42  The  most  celebrated
aspect  of this  general  idea  is  the  rule  of lenity,  which  leads  courts  to
resolve  ambiguities  favorably  to  the  criminal  defendant.243  Courts
also  interpret  statutes  to  minimize  administrative  discretion,  to  apply
prospectively,  and  to  require  or  permit  rules.  "[T]he  law  in  general
... does  not interpret  a grant of discretion to  eliminate  all 'categorical
rules."' 24 4

(e)  Political Deliberation; the  Constitutional Antipathy  to  Naked
Interest-Group Transfers. - Designed  to ensure  a kind  of deliberative
democracy,  the  constitutional  system  is hostile  to measures  that impose
burdens  or  grant  benefits  merely  because  of  the  political  power  of
private  groups. 245  Governmental  actions require  some public  value. 246
This  norm,  firmly  rooted in  current  law, has  a number of implications
for  statutory  interpretation. 
It  suggests,  for  example,  that  courts
should  develop  interpretive  strategies  that  promote  deliberation  in
government  - by,  for  example,  remanding  issues  involving  constitu-
tionally  sensitive  interests  or  groups  for  reconsideration  by  the  legis-
lature  or  by  regulatory  agencies  when  deliberation  appears  to  have
been  absent.  It  also  suggests  that  courts  should  narrowly  construe
statutes  that embody  mere  interest-group  deals. 24 7  This  principle  does
not  authorize  elaborate  judicial  review  of legislative  and  administra-
tive  processes,  but  it  does  require  a clear  statement  before  courts  will
construe  statutes  as  amounting  to  naked  wealth  transfers  or  as  in-
truding  into  constitutionally  sensitive  areas.

HARVARD  LAW REVIEW

[Vol.  103:405

(f)  Hearing Rights. - One  of the  most important  functions  of the
Constitution  is  to  provide  procedural  safeguards  by  affording  rights
to  a  hearing  and  to  judicial  review  in  cases  involving  important
interests. 248  The precise  extent  of these  safeguards is  sharply disputed.
It  is  unclear,  for  example,  whether  Congress  has  the  constitutional
power  to eliminate  hearing  rights  for  those seeking  regulatory  benefits,
or  to  provide  that  federal  courts  may  not  review  certain  claims. 249

In  this  area,  courts  often  interpret  statutes  in  the  shadow  of  con-
stitutional  hearing  rights.  For  this  reason,  courts  narrowly  interpret
statutory  provisions  purporting  to  eliminate  rights  to  a hearing  and  to
judicial  review. 25 0  The  ordinary  presumption  is  that  such  rights  are
available,  and  that  the  constitutional  issue  therefore  need  not  be  re-
solved.

(g)  Disadvantaged Groups. -

Some  of the  most  difficult  questions
in  contemporary  constitutional  law  involve  the  degree  of  protection
afforded  to  disadvantaged  groups  by  the  equal  protection  clause  of
the  fourteenth  amendment.  In  many of the  cases,  courts have  afforded
less  protection  than  they  otherwise  might  have  because  of a  desire  to
minimize  interferences  with  the  democratic  branches  of  government.

For  example,  in  one  of  its  most  important  and  controversial  de-
cisions  since  World  War II,  the  Supreme  Court held  that  to  establish
a violation  of the  equal  protection  clause,  blacks,  women,  and  others
must  show  "discriminatory  intent"  on  the  part  of  the  enacting  legis-
lature. 25 l  This  requirement  has  furnished  a  significant  barrier  to  con-
stitutional  complainants. 25 2  It  is  best  understood  at least  partly  as  an
outgrowth  of  institutional  concerns.  If  courts  held  that  a  dispropor-
tionate  effect  sufficed  to  raise  constitutional  doubts,  a  wide  variety  of
governmental  policies  would  be  seriously  questioned  -
an  extremely
intrusive  outcome  that  might be  inappropriate  in  light of  the  properly
limited  role  of the judiciary  in  American  government.

Courts  have  also  invoked  institutional  considerations  to  justify  an
interpretation  of  the  Constitution  that  affords  little  protection  to  cer-
tain  groups,  including  most  notably  the  handicapped  and  gays  and

INTERPRETING STATUTES

lesbians.253  In  this  light,  statutes  that  provide  protection  for  these
groups,  or  against  discriminatory  effects,  might  well  represent  the
legislature's  response  to  its judicially  underenforced  constitutional  re-
sponsibilities.  Through  statutory  construction,  courts  can  ensure  that
the  relevant  norms  are  vindicated.  Aggressive  construction  of ambig-
uous  statutes  designed  to  protect  disadvantaged  groups  provides  a
way  for  courts  to  protect  the  constitutional  norm  of  equal  protection
in  a less  intrusive  manner. 25 4

(h) Property and Contract Rights. -

In  the  aftermath  of the  New
Deal  reformation,  courts  have  been  reluctant  to  use  the  Constitution's
explicit  protection  of  property  and  contracts  in  a  way  that  would
seriously  interfere  with  social  and  economic  regulation. 25 5  To  a large
degree,  the  reluctance  is  a  product  of  the  Court's  substantive  belief
that redistributive  goals  fall within  the  state's police  power under  these
a large  shift  from  the  understanding  of  the  founding  gen-
clauses  -
eration.  Part  of  the  Court's  reluctance,  however,  derives  from  its
belief  that  in  the  post-New  Deal  period,  regulatory  interferences  with
private  contract  and  private  property  have  considerable  democratic
support,  and  the  judiciary  ought to  intervene  only  in  egregious  cases.
Whether  or  not the  Court's  unwillingness  to  provide  more  protec-
tion  to  rights  of  contract  and  property  is  justified, 25 6  courts  can  vin-
dicate  those  rights  less  intrusively  by  narrowly  construing  regulatory
statutes  that  raise  serious  constitutional  doubts  under  the  contracts
and  takings  clauses.

(i)  Welfare  Rights.  -

In  the  I96O's  and  i97o's,  a  number  of
commentators  urged  the  Supreme  Court  to  give  constitutional  protec-
tion  to  the  right  to  minimum  levels  of  subsistence. 25 7  These  claims

253  See  Bowers  v.  Hardwick,  478  U.S.  186  (1986)  (upholding a  Georgia  sodomy  statute  over
objections  based  on  the right of privacy);  City of  Cleburne v.  Cleburne  Living Center,  Inc.,  473
U.S.  432,  439-47  (1985)  (holding  that  mental  retardation  is  not a  quasi-suspect  classification,
but  that  requiring  a  special-use  permit  for  group  homes  for  the  mentally  retarded  nevertheless
violated  the  equal  protection  clause).

254  The  much-maligned  decision  in  Griggs  v.  Duke  Power  Co.,  401  U.S.  424  (197I),  raises
related  issues.  Under  Griggs, a  showing of  disparate  impact  shifts  to  the defendant  the  burden
of  demonstrating  business  necessity.  See  id. at  432.  In light  of  the fact  that proof of "discrim-
inatory purpose"  is  exceptionally  difficult  even  when  purpose  exists,  the Griggs framework  seems
appropriately  to  further  the  congressional  command.  See  Strauss,  supra note  252,  at  1012-14;
see also  infra pp.  484-85  (discussing  Griggs in  light of other  substantive  norms).

25S See,  e.g.,  Hawaii  Hous.  Auth.  v.  Midkiff,  467  U.S.  229  (1984)  (finding  no  violation  of
the  public  use  requirement);  Energy  Reserves  Group,  Inc.  v.  Kansas  Power  & Light  Co.,  459
U.S.  400  (1983)  (contracts  clause);  Penn  Cent.  Transp.  Co.  v.  New  York  City,  438  U.S.  104

have  plausible  if  not  firm  substantive  roots  in  some  of  the  most
prominent  theories  of judicial  review2 5 8  and  in  the  New  Deal  refor-
mation  of  the  constitutional  structure. 25 9  There  are,  however,  for-
midable  institutional  objections  to such  a judicial  role, 2 60  which  would
involve  careful  monitoring  of  a  massive  national  bureaucracy.  For
the  Supreme  Court  to  undertake  to  protect  welfare  rights  entirely  on
its  own  would  raise  serious  questions  of  democratic  legitimacy  and
remedial  competence.  Perhaps  a Court  that  saw  substantive  force  in
the  claim  for  constitutional  welfare  rights  would  attempt  to  vindicate
that  claim,  not through  the  Constitution  itself,  but through  aggressive
statutory  construction  to  ensure  against  irrational  or  arbitrary  depri-
vations  of  benefits.  Such  an  approach  would  tend  to  produce  even-
handedness  in  the  distribution  of funds  to  the  poor  in  a  democracy
that  has  committed  itself  to  a  "social  safety  net."  Statutory  construc-
tion,  requiring  a  clear  statement  before  allowing  selective  exclusions,
might  produce  many  of the  advantages  of recognition  of welfare  rights
without  imposing  nearly  so  severe  a strain  on  the  judiciary.

2.  Institutional Concerns. - A  number  of interpretive  principles
respond  directly  to  institutional  concerns  and  are  designed  to  improve
the  performance  of  governmental  entities.  Most  of  these  principles
are  straightforward  and  can  be  discussed  quite  briefly.

(a) Appropriations Statutes. - Courts  construe  appropriations  pro-
visions  quite  narrowly  in  light  of  judicial  understandings  about  the
character  of  the  appropriations  process,  in  which  careful  legislative
deliberation  is  highly  unlikely.26 1  Interest-group  power  is  particularly
likely  to  influence  results  in  this  context.

(b)  A  Cautious Approach  to  Legislative  History.  -

As  Justice
Scalia  has  emphasized, 262  legislative  history  is  sometimes  written  by
one  side  or  another  in  a  dispute  over  the  content  of the  law,  and  the
history  will  sometimes  reflect  a  view  that  could  not  prevail  in  the
processes  of congressional  deliberation. 2 63  In  any  case,  the  history  is
not law.  Courts  should  therefore  adopt  a firm  principle  of the  priority

INTERPRETING STATUTES

of  statutory  text  to  statutory  history  -
a  principle  that  does  not  call
on  courts  entirely  to  disregard  the  history,  but  that  gives  the  history
limited  weight  in  cases  of conflict.

(c)  The  Presumption Against  Implied  Repeals.  - Courts  do  not
lightly assume  that one statute  has  implicitly repealed  another. 264  This
principle  is  a  product  of  a  set  of  beliefs  about  the  legislative  process
-
in  particular,  a  belief  that  Congress,  focused  as  it  usually  is  on  a
particular  problem,  should  not be  understood  to have  eliminated  with-
out specific  consideration  another  program  that was  likely the  product
of  sustained  attention.

(d)  Implied  Exemptions from  Taxation.  - Courts  do  not  infer
exemptions  from  taxation. 2 65  This  principle  derives  partly  from  a
desire  to  protect  the  Treasury;  it  also  responds  to  the  perception  that
Congress  is  highly  attentive  to  tax  matters;  and  it  rests  partly  on  a
view  that  selective  exemptions  from  taxation  might  represent  a  de-
parture  from  ordinary  principles  of  equality  and  should  therefore  be
disfavored.

(e)  The  Question of Administrative Discretion. - Courts  defer  to
agency  understandings  of policy  and  fact  in  cases  in  which  discretion
has  lawfully  been  conferred. 266  This  idea  is  based  on  a  recognition
of  the  superior  democratic  accountability  and  fact-finding  capacity  of
the  agency  and  the  corresponding  belief  that  courts  ought  to  treat
agency  decisions  with  a  fair  degree  of  respect.  Similarly,  the  rare
judicial  decisions  finding  agency  action  not subject  to  judicial  review
are  based  on  perceptions  that  judicial  intervention  would  likely  be
counterproductive  in  the  circumstances. 267

vindicated  by  recent  experience 268  -

(f) The  Presumption in  Favor of Judicial Review.  - By  contrast,
courts  presume  that  the  legislature  has  not  precluded  judicial  review
of  agency  decisions.  This  presumption  is  partly attributable  to  a  belief
-
that  regulatory  agencies  are
susceptible  to  factionalism  and  self-interested  representation.  Judicial
review  operates  as  both  an  ex  ante  deterrent  against  dangers  of  this
sort  and  an  ex  post  corrective. 
If  Congress  is  to  eliminate  judicial
review,  it  must  do  so  unambiguously.

There  is  a  tension  between  the  goal  of  limiting  administrative
discretion  and  the  desire  to  ensure  that  courts  defer  to  the  agency's

specialized  fact-finding  and  policymaking  competence.  The  best  rec-
onciliation  of  these  competing  concerns  would  call  for  a  principle
requiring  a  clear  legislative  displacement  of judicial  review;  for  judi-
cial  deference  to  agency  decisions  on  facts,  policy,  and  "mixed"  ques-
tions  having  legal  components;  and  for  independent  judicial  review  of
pure  questions  of  law  except  where  Congress  has  delegated  interpre-
tive  power  to  the  agency.

(g)  Ratification, Acquiescence,  Stare Decisis, and Post-Enactment
History. - Although  Congress'  post-enactment  views  do  not have  the
authority  of law,  stare  decisis  and  post-enactment  history  should  play
a  limited  role  in  interpretation. 2 69  Post-enactment  history  deserves
the  least  deference.  Like  other  legislative  history,  it  can  provide  a
sense  of context,  but it has  the  normal  difficulties  of unenacted  views;
indeed,  it is  even  worse  than  pre-enactment  history  in  the  sense  that
it  is  uninformative  about  the  desires  of  the  enacting  Congress.  On
the  other  hand,  evidence  that  part  or  all  of  Congress  has  endorsed  a
judicial  construction  or  interpreted  a  statute  in  a  particular  way  is
important  in  furthering  the  goals  of  rationality,  consistency,  and  co-
ordination  in  interpretation.  Stare  decisis  principles  have  traditionally
served  the  same  function  of ensuring  rationality  and  consistency,  even
though  the previous  decision  may  not have  accurately  understood  the
original  meaning  of the  statute. 270

3.  Counteracting Statutory Failure. -

I  have  suggested  that  a
number  of interpretive  principles  in  current law  are  intended  to  coun-
teract  failures  in  social  and  economic  regulation.2 71  The  general  idea
that statutory  construction  should  combat  characteristic  pathologies  in
regulatory  legislation  is  well-grounded  in  existing  doctrine.  In  this
section,  I  outline  and  defend  a  series  of  interpretive  norms  designed
to  promote  this  goal.  Some  of  the  particular  norms  have  solid  roots
in  current  case  law;  others  are  implicit;  still  others  find  at  best  am-
biguous  support  and  are  proposed  here  for  the  first  time.  I  indicate
the  relationship  between  the  suggested  norms  and  current  law  in  the
particular  discussions.

Courts  should,  I  argue,  try  to  avoid  characteristic  failures  in  reg-
ulation  -
caused,  for example,  by a failure  to  understand  the  systemic
effects  of regulation  or to  coordinate  statutes  regulating  the  same  area.
Courts  should  also  be  aware  of  the  risks  of  overenforcement  and
underenforcement  and  therefore  permit de  minimis  exceptions,  assume
proportionality  in  regulation,  and  generously  construe  statutes  de-

INTERPRETING STATUTES

signed  to  protect  traditionally  disadvantaged  groups  and  nonmarket
values.

Some  of  these  ideas,  depending  for  their  support  on  views  about
regulatory  failure,  are  of  course  products  of  contestable  substantive
claims.  Notwithstanding  their  number  and  variety,  moreover,  the
principles  are  united  by  certain  general  goals,  which  include,  above
all,  the  effort  to  promote  accountability  and  deliberation  in  govern-
ment,  to  furnish  surrogates  when both  are  absent,  to limit factionalism
and  self-interested  representation,  and  to  further  political  equality.
All  of  the  principles  respond  to  an  understanding  of  the  various  rea-
sons  for  statutes  and  of the  various  ways  that  statutes  fail.

(a)  Promoting Political Accountability. - Courts  should  construe
statutes so  that  those who are  politically accountable  and  highly visible
will  make  regulatory  decisions.  This  norm  finds  its  justification  in
constitutional  and  institutional  considerations  deriving  from  the  basic
premise  of  electoral  accountability  and  also  in  a  perception  that  reg-
ulatory  failure  is  sometimes  a  product  of  factional  power.2 72  As  we
have  seen,  a  number  of  cases  growing  out  of  constitutional  concerns
recognize  this basic  principle. 2 73  Reflecting judicial  reluctance  to allow
agencies  to  exercise  discretionary  power  that  has  not  been  clearly
delegated,  these  cases  often  require  accountable  actors  to  make  deci-
sions  involving  important  rights  and  politically  weak  groups.  Such
decisions  can  also  be  understood  as  an  effort  to  counteract  regulatory
failure  that  occurs  from  a  lack  of accountability.

Other  doctrines  also  draw  from  the  goal  of  promoting  political
accountability.  The  principle  that  courts  should  defer  to  administra-
tive  interpretations  of  statutes  is  an  example. 274  Indeed,  in  the  most
important  recent  case  invoking  that  principle,  the  Supreme  Court
referred  expressly  to  the  greater  accountability  of  the  President  in
comparison  to  the judiciary. 275  Because  the  President,  unlike  a  judge,
is  elected,  interpretation  of  statutes  raising  controversial  questions  of
public  policy  should  be  made  by the  executive  branch,  at  least  where
the  legislature  has  granted  the  executive  the  power  to  construe  am-
biguous  statutes.  As  lawmaker,  however,  Congress  is  in  a  superior
position  to  the  President  or the  regulatory  agency.  In  order  to  ensure
compliance  with  legislative  instructions,  courts,  not  potentially  self-
interested  regulators,  should  resolve  statutory  ambiguities  involving
pure  questions  of  law. 276  But  the  principle  of  leaving  decisions  to
electorally  accountable  officials  is  sound  insofar  as  it  recognizes  that

HARVARD  LAW  REVIEW

[Vol.  103:405

Congress  may  and  often  does  delegate  to  regulatory  agencies  and  the
President  the  power  to  fill  in  statutory  gaps. 2 77

(b)  Taking Account of Collective Action Problems.2 78  - Regulatory
statutes  are  sometimes  subverted  in  the  implementation  process,  often
as  a result of the  diffuse  character  of the  class  of regulatory  beneficia-
ries. 2 79  In  one  common  scenario,  the  beneficiaries  of regulatory  pro-
grams,  though  numerous  and  ordinarily  disorganized,  are  able  to
mobilize  to  obtain  protective  legislation. 
-As  the  statute  is  imple-
mented,  however,  the  group  tends  to  dissipate,  and  well-organized
members  of  the  regulated  class  are  able  to  exert  continuing  pressure
on  the  agency.  The  regulatory  program  is  skewed  against  effective
implementation. 280  Congress'  words  become  purely  symbolic,  and
inadequate  implementation  prevents  the  statute  from  accomplishing
legislative  goals. 
judicial  interpretation  of  ambiguous  statutes  that
takes  account  of this  phenomenon  will promote  fidelity  to  these  goals.
Many  decisions  appear  to  have  reacted  to  the  possibility  that  col-
lective  action  problems  will  undermine  regulatory  programs.  The
most  conspicuous  examples  are  decisions  aggressively  construing  reg-
ulatory  statutes  in  order  to  protect  the  environment. 28 1  The  context
presents  a classic  setting  for  regulatory  "failure"  resulting  from  collec-
tive  action  problems  (not to  mention unrepresented  future  generations,
which  cannot  wield  political  power).  Other  illustrations  include  ju-
dicial  decisions  taking  a  careful  look  at administrative  decisions  that
jeopardize  the  interests  of regulatory  beneficiaries. 282  These  decisions
also  respond  to  a perception  that  poorly organized  beneficiaries  are  at
risk  during  implementation,  and  that  as a result,  legislative  goals  will
not  be  carried  out  in  the  real  world.

Cases  responding  to  overzealous  regulation  may  be  motivated  by
a  similar  concern.2 8 3  In  this  context,  a  collective  action  problem  or
structural  infirmity  may  incline  the  agency  toward  excessive  intrusion

INTERPRETING STATUTES

into the  marketplace.  Cases  involving  OSHA regulation 284  and  bank-
ing  controls 285  provide  examples.

(c)  Promoting Consistency and  Coherence Among  Regulatory Pro-
grams.  - The  post-New  Deal  proliferation  of  regulatory  programs
has  sometimes  led  to  inconsistency  and  incoherence  in  the  law.  For
example,  the standards  for  regulating  carcinogens  are  notoriously  var-
iable;  they  call  for  excessive  controls  in  some  areas  and  unduly  weak
regulation  in  others. 286  Some  carcinogens  are  thus  regulated  at a  cost
of  $40  million  per  life  saved,  whereas  others  cost  $400,000  or  less. 28 7
The  absence  of  centralization  has  led  to  regulatory  failures  -
in  the
form  of  incoherent  and  even  chaotic  regulation  -
in  numerous
areas. 2 88

As  a  partial  solution,  courts  should  require  a  clear  statement  by
Congress  before  allowing  a  statute  to  create  significant  inconsistency
in  the  law.  A  judicial  role  of  this  sort has  clear  precedent  in  contem-
porary administrative  law  and  in the  old  canon  that statutes  governing
the  same  subject  matter  should  be  construed  together. 28 9  In  light  of
the  potentially  chaotic  pattern  of  social  and  economic  regulation,  ju-
dicial  decisions  limiting  agency  authority  to  impose  huge  costs  for
uncertain  or  speculative  gains  might  be  seen  as  part of  an  integration
of statutory  systems  into  a  coherent  whole. 290  Similar  considerations

help  explain  Bob  Jones University v.  United States.29 1  This  decision
might  be understood  as  an  effort  to  ensure  that the  IRS  takes  account
of  the  widespread  social  antagonism  toward  racial  discrimination,  as
part  of the  general  thrust  of  contemporary  "public  policy."

(d)  Considering Systemic  Effects.  - Regulation  is  frequently  un-
successful  because  of  a  failure  to  understand  the  complex  systemic
effects  of  governmental  controls. 292  Courts  dealing  with  regulatory
issues  often  act  as if  the  decision  will  create  only  ex  post winners  and
losers  in  the particular  case.  This  misunderstanding  leads  to statutory
construction  that is uninformed  by the real-world  impact  of regulation.
Examples  include  the  Supreme  Court's  OSHA  decisions, 293  in  which
several  members  of  the  Court  appeared  to  assume  that  greater  pro-
tection  for  workers  would  automatically  follow  from  more  stringent
statutory  requirements.2 94  This  assumption  is  false.  By  requiring
government  to  regulate  to  the  point  of  "feasibility"  and  forbidding
balancing  of benefits  and  costs,  stringent  statutory  requirements  have
at  times  harmed  workers  themselves.  Faced  with  such  onerous  re-
quirements, 295  regulators  have  often  underenforced  the  statute  by fail-
ing  to  enforce  the  rules  on  the  books  or  by  refusing  to  issue  rules  at
all.296  Interpreting  an  environmental  or  occupational  health  law  as
especially  protective  may  ultimately  decrease  regulatory  protection.
The  problem  of  unintended  or  perverse  side-effects 
is  pervasive.
Courts  should  understand  the  sometimes  counterintuitive  systemic
consequences  of different  interpretations  of  regulatory  statutes.

(e)  Avoiding Private Law Principles. - As  suggested  above,  courts
cannot  properly  invoke  common  law  principles  of  private  autonomy
as  the  backdrop  for  interpreting  public  law.297  Suppose,  for  example,
that  a  statute  allows  employees  to  file  workers'  compensation  claims,
and  that  an  employer  attempts  to  discharge  an  employee  for  filing
such a claim.  In  this setting,  courts  should not invoke  the  background
rule  of at-will  employment  in  order  to  uphold  the  discharge,  even  if
the  legislature  has  not explicitly  displaced  that rule  in  this  context.2 98

INTERPRETING STATUTES

The  at-will  rule  would  undermine  the  purpose  of  the  workers'  com-
pensation  statute.  When  the  legislature  intends  to  transform  the  re-
lationships  created  by the  common  law,  principles  rooted  in  the  com-
mon  law  do  not provide  an  appropriate  background  rule.

Private  law  principles  are  wrongly  applied  in  several  areas  of
modern  law.  In  interpreting  the  provisions  of  the  Administrative
Procedure  Act  (APA),2 99  the  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  agency
action  is  presumptively  reviewable,  but  that  agency  inaction  is  pre-
sumptively  unreviewable,  in  part because  agency inaction  is  not "coer-
cive." 300  This understanding  depends  on an  outmoded  conception  that
finds  coercion  only in  cases  in  which  government  intrudes on  common
law rights.  Under this  view, for example,  the failure  to protect against
environmental  harms  or  discrimination  is  not  coercive  at all.  But the
New  Deal  reformation,  and  the  existence  of  social  and  economic
regulation  in  general,  are  largely  based  on  an  understanding  that  the
market  creates  a  kind  of  coercion  against  which  government  must
guard.  For  this  reason,  it  is  quite  troublesome  to  use  common  law
principles  of  coercion  as  the  basis  for  creating  a  presumption  against
review  of  inadequate  regulatory  protection. 30 1

On  occasion,  the  Court's  treatment  of  the  standing  provisions  of
the  APA30 2  has  likewise  disserved  the  goals  of  the  legislature  in  en-
acting  regulatory  statutes.  In  some  cases  construing  the  APA,  the
Court  has  barred  regulatory  beneficiaries  from  seeking  relief  because
they  lacked  a  common  law  injury.30 3  In  others,  the  Court  has  used
a  clear-statement  principle  in  favor  of  continued  judicial  power  to
"balance  the  equities"  in  environmental  cases  and  has  thus  decreased
the  likelihood  of  injunctive  relief  in  such  cases. 30 4  In  both  of  these
contexts,  the Court  has used  traditional  private  law principles  in  order
to  give  content  to  modern  public  law;  in  both  settings,  the  resulting
doctrine  disserves  the  goals  of the  legislature. 30 5

provision  states  that  a  "court,  in  its  discretion,  may  allow  the  prevailing  party,  other  than  the

(f)  Avoiding  Irrationality and Injustice. - A  time-honored  prin-
ciple  in  Anglo-American  law  is  that  statutes  should  be  construed  to
avoid irrationality  and  injustice,  even  whell  the language  of the statute
seems  to  lead  in  that  direction. 30 6  The  principle  is  controversial  be-
cause  there  is  no  obvious  basis  for  deciding  whether  an  outcome  is
irrational,  and  because  it  is  plausible  to  suggest  that  the  correction
for  any  such  defect  should  come  from  the  legislature  rather  than  the
courts.  Because  courts  are  able  to  focus  upon  the  concrete  and  often
unforeseeable  effects  of  general  statutory  provisions,  however,  they
are  in  a  much  better  position  to  judge  whether  a particular  provision
produces  peculiar  consequences  in  a particular  setting.  The judgment
that the  consequence  is  peculiar -
and  could  not  plausibly  have  been
intended  -
is  sometimes  irresistible.  On  occasion  the  text,  read  lit-
erally,  will appear  to  compel results  that the  legislature  could  not have
anticipated  and  resolved  in  enacting  a  broad  standard.  It  would  be
unrealistic  to  think  that  any  legislature  could  or  should  correct  every
such  problem.

In  such  circumstances,  what  might  appear  to  be  aggressive  con-
struction  is  entirely  legitimate 30 7  -
at  least  if  the  injustice  or  irra-
tionality  is  palpable  and  there  is  no  affirmative  evidence  that  the
legislature  intended  the  result.  Usually  the  interpretive  issue  in  such
cases  resembles  Wittgenstein's  game  of dice. 30 8  Here  it  is  fully  plau-

were  wholly  frivolous,  even  if the  intervenor  had  acted  only after  the  defendant  had  agreed  to
settle.  See  Zipes,  IO9  S.  Ct.  at  2736-39.  The  Court  reasoned  that  the fee-award  provision  is
subject to "the  competing  equities  that Congress normally  takes into  account,"  and those  equities
called  for a rule  that  would permit an  intervenor - who  was  not a wrongdoer  -
to participate
free  from  liability for  fees.  See  id. at 2736.

The  dissent argued  that  in light  of the  congressional  effort  to encourage  civil  rights  plaintiffs
to  bring  suit  and  to  settle  as  well,  intervenors  should  be  liable  for  fees.  See  id.  at  2741-46
(Marshall,  J.,  dissenting).  The  Court  responded that  "the  essential  difference"  between  the  two
sides  had  to  do  with  whether  title  VII  should  be  interpreted  as  reconciling  "competing  rights"
in  the  traditional  way,  or instead  as  placing  plaintiffs  at  the  highest  point  of  a hierarchy.  See
IO9  S.  Ct.  at  2738  n.4.  On  this score,  the  Court's  resolution  depended  on  its  assumption  that
the  fee-shifting  provisions  of  title  VII  should  be  interpreted  against  the  backdrop  of  the  rights
possessed  before  the  statute  was  enacted.  But  the  enactment  of  title  VII  in  general  and  of the
fee-shifting  provision  in  particular  probably  should  have  been  considered  a  repudiation  of  the
more  open-ended  equitable  balancing  that  preceded  it.  See  id. at  2742-46  (Marshall,  J.,  dis-
senting).

306  See  Public  Citizen  v.  United  States  Dep't  of  Justice,  109  S.  Ct.  2558,  2566-67  (1989);
O'Connor v. United  States,  479 U.S.  27,  31  (x986);  Brock  v. Pierce  County, 476  U.S.  253,  258-

307  See,  e.g.,  Public Citizen,  io9  S.  Ct.  at  2566  (rejecting  the  literal  meaning  of  a  statute

o9  S.
Ct.  I981,  2984  (1989));  see  also  id. (citing  cases).  The  emphasis  of  the legal  process  school  on
the need to construe  statutes so  that they are  "reasonable"  has continuing  relevance,  and provides
a  degree  of  interpretive  guidance.  See  R.  DWORKIN,  supra note  I9,  at  148-6o;  H.  HART  & A.

INTERPRETING STATUTES

sible  to interpret a  statute  so  as  not  to apply  notwithstanding  its literal
meaning.

In  Eisen v.  Carlisle &  Jacquelin,30 9  for  example,  the  Court  con-
fronted  the  issue  of  the  notice  requirements  for  class  members  in  a
class  action  in  which  the  individual  claims  were  extremely  small.
Federal  Rule  of Civil  Procedure  23  requires  "the best notice  practicable
under  the  circumstances,  including  individual  notice  to  all  class  mem-
bers  who  can  be identified  through  reasonable  effort." 3 10  Interpreting
the  language  literally,  a  unanimous  Supreme  Court  held  that  identi-
fiable  class  members  had  to  be  notified  of  the  suit. 31 '

The  result  of  Eisen  - which  effectively  bars  small  claim  class
actions  in  most  settings  -
is  exceedingly  peculiar.  The  purpose  of
notice  is  to  protect  those  who  are  to  be  notified;  in  a  case  in  which
those  notified  do  not have  individually  viable  claims,  it  seems  odd  to
suggest  that  notice  is  required  in  deference  to  their  interests.  More-
over,  it  is  utterly  irrational  on  the  one  hand  to  allow  balancing  with
respect  to  the  costs  of identifying  class  members,  but on  the  other  to
impose  a  per  se  rule  in favor  of notice  when  the  costs  of identification
are  low  and  the  costs  of  providing  notice  are  extremely  high.  The
drafters  of  the  notice  provision  of  rule  23  probably  were  not  thinking
about  the  problem  of  individually  small  but  collectively  large  claims
when  they  drafted  the  notice  provision.  As  in  Wittgenstein's  game  of
dice,  the  literal language,  read acontextually,  leads  to an  absurd  result.
(g)  Protecting Disadvantaged Groups; Civil Rights  Questions. -
Disadvantaged  groups  are  especially  at  risk  in  the  process  of  imple-
mentation.  The  same  stereotypes  and  prejudices  that  afflict  disadvan-
taged  groups  in  the  marketplace  can  also  affect  those  responsible  for
implementing  statutory  protections.  Those in  a  position  to  enforce  the
law  thus  tend  to  do  so  inadequately.  Difficulties  of  organization  and
mobilization  -
including  the  costs,  stigma,  threat  to  future  employ-
ment,  and  other  burdens  of  bringing  an  enforcement  action  -
under-
mine  implementation  as  well. 3 1 2 
In  the  face  of  ambiguity,  courts
should  resolve  interpretive  doubts  in  favor  of  disadvantaged  groups
so  as  to  ensure  that  regulatory  statutes  are  not defeated  in  the  imple-
mentation  process.

This  idea  has  roots  in  existing  law,  though  the  basic  principle  has
rarely  been  explicitly  recognized. 3 13  The  well-established  idea  that
statutes  should  be  interpreted  in  favor  of  Indian  tribes  is  the  most
conspicuous  example  of  this  general  idea. 3 14  Likewise,  the  Supreme

[Vol.  X03:405

Court's  general  hostility  to  the  creation  of  implied  rights  of  action
finds  an  exception  in  the  civil  rights  laws.  In  a  number  of  cases,
courts  have  created  implied  rights  to  protect  disadvantaged  groups  in
the  face  of  an  ambiguous  text. 315  A  number  of  decisions  reflect  gen-
erous  interpretations  of  statutes  protecting  the  disabled. 3 16  Respond-
ing  to  this  rationale,  courts  have  often  aggressively  construed  statutes
forbidding  discrimination  on  the  basis  of race  and  sex3 17 -
although
recent  cases  suggest  a  movement  in  the  opposite  direction,  perhaps
rooted  in  a  competing  norm  of  private  autonomy.3 18

An  example  here  is  Wards Cove  Packing Co.  v.  Atonio, 3 19  which
involved  the  standards  governing  disparate-impact  cases  brought  un-
der  title VII. 320  In  Griggs v.  Duke Power Co.,321  the  Court  held  that
once  a  plaintiff  showed  that  an  employment  practice  had  a  discrimi-
natory  impact  on  members  of a minority  group,  the  burden  shifted  to
the  defendant  to  show  that  the  practice  was  justified  by  "business
necessity." 322  In  Wards Cove,  the  Court  altered  Griggs in  two  major
ways.  First,  it held  that the  defendant's  burden  is  one  of production,
not  of persuasion,  and  the  plaintiff  must  carry  the  burden  of persua-
sion  on  the  issue  of business  justification. 323  Second,  and  more  fun-
damentally,  the  Court  held  that  the  defendant  need  not  show  that  a
challenged  practice  is  "'essential'  or  'indispensable'  to  the  employer's
business." 32 4  Instead,  the  question  is  "whether  a  challenged  practice
serves,  in  a  significant  way,  the  legitimate  employment  goals  of  the
employer. "325

The  textual  proscription  of  "discrimination"  does  not  resolve  the
questions  in  Wards Cove.  The text does  not indicate  whether  discrim-

contagious  diseases).

317  See,  e.g.,  United  Steelworkers  v. Weber,  443  U.S.  193  (,979) (holding  that title VII  allows
voluntary  affirmative  action  plans);  Griggs  v.  Duke  Power  Co.,  401  U.S.  424  (X971)  (holding
that title  VII  prohibits  facially  neutral  practices  with  disparate  impact on  minorities).

318  This tendency was  especially  pronounced  in  I989. See,  e.g.,  Independent  Fed'n of  Flight

reveals  that  the  legislators  were  thinking  largely  of  obvious  cases  of
racial  nonneutrality,  it  does  not  indicate  whether  the  statutory  pros-
cription  applies  when  the  defendant  adopts  a  practice,  not  justified
by  business  necessity,  that  "'freeze[s]'  the  status  quo  of prior  discrim-
inatory  practices, '3 26  or when  the practice  has a  disproportionate  effect
on  blacks  that  the  employer  would  not  be  willing  to  tolerate  if  the
burdened  group  consisted  of whites. 3 27  Wards Cove  thus  raises  ques-
tions  about  gaps  and  implementing  devices,  questions  that  the  text
and  history  of the  statute  inform  but  do  not  answer. 328

To  resolve  the  disagreement  between  the  majority  and  the  dissent,
one  must  ask  a  value-laden  question:  what  sorts  of  devices  best  im-
plement  the  nondiscrimination  guarantee  if  it  is  properly  character-
ized?  The  Wards  Cove  Court  did  not  discuss  this  question  at  all;
instead  it  acted  as  if  the  statute  and  relevant  precedents  largely  dis-
posed  of the  question.  Although  the  issue  is  complex,  one  might  start
by  observing  that  discriminatory  purpose  is  exceptionally  difficult  to
show  even  when  it  exists.  A  test  that  makes  discriminatory  effects
probative  of  discriminatory  purpose  might  invalidate  some  practices
that  should,  given  perfect  implementing  devices,  be  upheld.  Wards
Cove,  however,  will  validate  many  practices  that  should,  given  such
devices,  be  struck  down.  Moreover,  discrimination  exists  when  an
employer  has  been  nonneutral  in  the  sense  that  it  has  adopted  a
practice  having  a  discriminatory  effect  on  blacks  that  it  would  not
have  adopted  if the  burden  had  been  imposed  on  whites;  Wards  Cove
will  not reach  this  form  of discrimination.  For  these  reasons,  Wards
Cove  will  produce  substantial  underenforcement  of  the  law.  By  con-
trast,  systemic  barriers  to  the  implementation  of  antidiscrimination
statutes3 29  make  any  concern  about  overenforcement  highly  specula-
tive.  No  approach  is  perfect in  this situation,  but Griggs was  probably
a  better  method  of  implementing  the  statutory  proscription.

(h)  Protecting Nonmarket  Values.  -

Statutes  are  frequently  de-
signed  to  protect  aspirations  or  other  values  that  the  market  under-

326  Griggs, 401  U.S.  at  430.
327  This  conception  of neutrality  might  well  satisfy  an  intent  requirement.  On  this  view,  if
the  employer  would  not  be  willing  to  use  the  same  test  if the  burdened  and  benefited  groups
were  switched,  he has  discriminated.  This understanding  of neutrality  includes  racially selective
concern  and  indifference  as  well  as  conscious  racial  animus.  See  Strauss,  supra note  252,  at
956-59.

328  For  this  reason,  the  decision  must  be  regarded  as  a form  of federal  common  law,  akin

to  the  implementation  of the  Sherman  Act  and  §  1983.  See  supra pp.  421-22.

values. 3 30  Those  "nonmarket"  values  -
reflected  in  laws  regulating
broadcasting  and  protecting  the  environment  and  endangered  species
are  often  jeopardized  in  the  post-enactment  political  "market,"  for
-
the  same  reasons  that  nonmarket  values  are  threatened  by  the  will-
ingness-to-pay  criterion  of the  economic  marketplace.  If this  charac-
terization  is  accurate,  an  aggressive  judicial  role,  combating  a  char-
acteristic  form  of regulatory  failure,  is  an  appropriate  way  to  achieve
legislative- goals.  In  many  decisions  interpreting  the  "public  interest"
standard  of the  Federal  Communications  Act, 33 1  courts  have  prodded
the  FCC  to  promote  diversity,  local  control,  local  participation,  and
high-quality  programming,  and  to  work  against  racism  and  sexism  in
broadcasting 332  -
all  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  market  for
broadcasting  may  fail  to  respect  such  norms.  A  similar  solicitude  for
nonmarket  values  helps  account  for  decisions  taking  a  skeptical  look
at efforts  to  deregulate  broadcasting 333  and  perhaps  most  notably for
the  aggressive  judicial  protection  of the  environment. 334

INTERPRETING STATUTES

in  areas  of  economic  regulation,  such  as  banking  and  agriculture. 3 36
It  also  informs  the  courts'  approach  to  the  Robinson-Patman  Act 337
and  their  effort  to  understand  the  Sherman  Act  as  an  attempt  to
promote  consumer  welfare  rather  than  as  protection  of small  business
as  such. 33 8  When  a  public  purpose  is  palpably  absent,  this  principle
should  be  unexceptionable. 3 39

(j)  Requiring  Proportionality. - Another  interpretive  principle
would  understand  statutes  to  impose  benefits  roughly  commensurate
with  their  costs,  unless  there  is  a  clear  legislative  statement  to  the
contrary.  This  proportionality  norm, 
recent
cases, 340  draws  on  an  understanding  of  likely legislative  purpose  and
on  perceptions  about  regulatory  failure.  Statutes  often  fail  because  of
excessive  controls  or inadequate  implementation, 3 41  and  courts  should
generally  assume  that  Congress  wants  to  avoid  those  problems  and
therefore  intends  agencies  to  impose  regulations  after  a  balancing
process. 34 2  As we  have  seen,  the  absence  of a  proportionality  principle

GTE  Sylvania,  Inc.,  433  U.S.  36,  51-59  (1977).

339  This  principle  must  not,  however,  be  confused  with  the  unjustifiable  idea  that  statutes
in derogation  of the  common  law  should  be  narrowly  construed;  it is  not a  license  for  grudging
interpretation  of  statutes  that  promote  noncommodity  values  or  that  embody  public-spirited
redistribution,  as  suggested  in  Easterbrook,  cited  above  in  note  13,  at  539-43.  This  is  also  a
problem  with  the  otherwise  excellent  treatment  in  Macey,  cited  above  in  note  i59.  As  the
experience  of  the  early  part  of  this  century  reveals,  it is  not  for  courts  -
in  the  process  of
statutory  construction  -
to  take  a  side  in  the  regulatory  debate  that  runs  in  the  face  of  a
legislative  judgment.  Courts should therefore  attempt  to  discern  a public-regarding  purpose  and
give  the  benefit  of every  doubt  to  the legislature.  But  sometimes  such  purposes  are  not  even
plausibly  at work.  Of  course,  some  difficult  line-drawing  problems  will  exist.

340  See,  e.g.,  Industrial  Union  Dep't,  AFL-CIO  v. American  Petroleum  Inst.,  448  U.S.  607,
652  (198o)  (plurality  opinion)  ("[Tihe  mere  possibility  that  some  employee  somewhere  in  the

§  7412  (1982),  which  requires  emissions  standards  that  provide  "an  ample  margin  of  safety,"
permits  the  Administrator  to  consider  cost  and  technology  despite  the  statute's  failure  to  refer
expressly  to  those  factors.  The decision  is  best understood  as founded  on a background  principle
of  proportionality,  one  that  Congress  may  eliminate  only through  a  clear  statement.

may produce  harmful systemic  consequences  as well  as  overregulation.
Ironically,  it  will  also  produce  severe  underregulation.  Moreover,
bureaucratic  self-interest  or factional  pressures  sometimes  incline  agen-
cies  toward  overzealous  enforcement,  which  Congress  is  unable  rou-
tinely  to  monitor  or  remedy.  The  proportionality  norm  is  reinforced
as  well  by  interpretive  norms  calling  for  legislative  deliberation. 
It
leads  to  narrow  construction  of statutes  enacted  as  a result  of interest-
group  pressure  or  as  myopic  or  impulsive  reactions  to  short-term
problems.

The  difficulty with  this  principle  is  that there  is  no  uncontroversial
metric  with  which  to  measure  social  costs  and  social  benefits.  If courts
understand  benefits  and  costs  technically  -
as  in  the  economic  for-
mulation  -
and  make  the  assessment  turn  on  private  willingness  to
pay,  they  will  undervalue  aspirations  and  nonmarket  values  and  ul-
timately  undermine  statutory  goals. 34 3  The  very  decision  to  create  a
regulatory  system  often  reflects  a  rejection  of  private  willingness  to
pay  as  the  criterion  of  social  choice.  Many  statutes  are  designed  to
transform  rather  than  to  implement  preferences, 
to  redistribute  re-
sources,  or  to  reflect  the  outcome  of  a  deliberative  process  about
relevant  public  values. 3 44  Moreover,  a  statute  that  protects  (for  ex-
ample) endangered  species  may  have symbolic  or aspirational  benefits.
The  various  values  that  are  served  by  regulatory  programs  should  be
treated  hospitably.

For  these  reasons,  the  proportionality  principle  is  most  useful  for
cases  of  economic  regulation.  It  becomes  most  workable  when  it  is
clear,  by  reference  to  a  widely  held  social  consensus,  that  the  social
benefits  are  small  in  comparison  to  the  social  costs.  Even  in  cases  of
public  aspirations  or  nonmarket  values, 
idea
should be  invoked when the disadvantages  of regulation  seem  to dwarf
the  advantages,  at least  when  the  statute  is  ambiguous. 345

(k)  Allowing  de  Minimis Exceptions.  -

It  follows  from  the  pro-
portionality  principle  that  regulatory  statutes  should  ordinarily  be
understood  to  contain  de  minimis  exceptions.  In  such  cases,  the  costs
of  regulation  outweigh  the  benefits,  which  are  by  hypothesis  insub-
stantial.  Moreover,  the  failure  to  allow  de  minimis  exceptions  will

343  See,  e.g.,  Anderson,  Values,  Risks, and Market Norms,  17  PHIL.  & PUB.  AFF.  54  (1988);
see  also  Dworkin,  Is  Wealth  a  Value?,  9  J.  LEGAL  STUD.  191,  2o6-2  (198O)  (arguing  that
wealth  maximization  in  itself is  not a  value).

344  Thus,  title  VII  is  partly  an  effort  to  transform  preferences;  the  minimum  wage  has
redistributive  purposes;  the  Clean  Air  Act  is  partly  an  outcome  of  a  deliberative  process.  On
these  and  other regulatory  functions,  see  C.  SUNSTEIN,  cited  above  note  *,  chs.  1-2.

345  This principle  casts  in doubt  the outcome  in Tennessee  Valley Authority  v.  Hill,  437  U.S.
153  (1978),  which  held  that  the  Endangered  Species  Act  blocked  construction  of  a  dam  that
would  destroy  the  habitat  of  the  snail  darter.  See  also  R.  DWORKIN,  supra note  x9,  at  347

probably  decrease  rather  than  increase  health  and  safety.3 4 6  Admin-
istrators  should  be  allowed  to  refuse  to  impose  costly  regulations  for
highly  speculative  or  minimal  gains. 34 7  Many  courts  have  reached
precisely  this  conclusion.  Indeed,  courts  should  probably  require  such
exceptions  in  the  absence  of  an  explicit  statutory  text  or  plausible
substantive  justifications 348  to  the  contrary.

.

4.  Examples.  - Two  important  cases  involving  the  meaning  of
the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Act  illustrate  the  basic  frame-
work.  The  pertinent  language  of  the  statute34 9  directs  OSHA  to
promulgate  the  standard  that  "most  adequately  assures,  to  the  extent
. that  no  employee  will  suffer  material  impairment  of
feasible  .
health  or  functional  capacity  even  if  such  employee  has  regular  ex-
posure  to  the  hazard  . . . for the  period  of  his  working  life."'35 0  The
statute  also  contains  a  general  definition  of "occupational  safety  and
health  standard,"  which  says  that  the  term  refers  to  measures  that
require  "conditions  ... 
reasonably  necessary  or appropriate  to  provide
safe  or  healthful  employment  and  places  of employment."'35 '

In  Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO v.  American Petroleum
Institute,352  the  Supreme  Court  invalidated  an  OSHA  regulation  of
benzene.  Although  the  precise  consequences  of  the  regulation  were
sharply  contested,  there  was  evidence  that  the  regulation  would  im-
pose  enormous  costs  in  exchange  for  small  or  speculative  gains.
OSHA  itself  concluded  that  its  regulation  would  require  capital  in-
vestments  of  $266  million,  first-year  operating  costs  of  $187  to  $205

346  See  supra p.  423.
347  Courts  have  reached  somewhat  conflicting  conclusions  on  this  point.  The  background
rule,  however,  seems  to  be  in  favor  of  de  minimis  exceptions.  See  Public  Citizen  v.  Young,

million,  and  recurring  annual  costs  of  $34  million.35 3  Contemporary
scientific  knowledge  appeared  to  preclude  a  clear  prediction  of  signif-
icant  benefits,  which  in  the  Court's  view  "may  be  relatively  small. '35 4
A  plurality  of  the  Court  concluded  that  the  definitional  clause
required  OSHA  to  establish  a  "significant  risk"  before  regulating  a
toxic  substance.  The  plurality  justified  its  conclusion  by  referring  to
the  Act's  definition  of  occupational  safety  and  health  standards  as
those  "reasonably  necessary  or  appropriate  to  provide  safe  or healthful
employment.  355  In  the  Court's  view,  a  standard  was  not  "reasonably
necessary  or  appropriate"  if  OSHA  was  unable  to  demonstrate  a  sig-
nificant  risk.

There  was,  however,  little  direct  basis  in  the  text or  history  of  the
Act  for  the  plurality's  conclusion.  Congress  did  not  explicitly  require
OSHA  to  show  a  "significant  risk."  The  plurality  found  that  such  a
requirement  was  implicit  in  the  definitional  clause,  but  it  is  very
unusual  to  read  a  definitional  clause,  ordinarily  carrying  no  weight,
as  creating  a  substantive  limitation  on  administrative  power.  The
clause  is  more  plausibly  treated  as  having  no  substantive  content,  or
as  having  substantive  content  defined  by  other  provisions  of  the  Act.
It  is  even  more  unusual  for  the  Court  to  look  to  a  definitional  clause
when  the  definition,  so  interpreted,  contradicts  a  far  more  specific
substantive  provision,  which  in  this  case  says  that  toxic  substance
standards  must  ensure  "to  the  extent  feasible  .
. . that  no  employee
will suffer  material impairment of  health  or functional capacity. '35 6
The  reference  to  "no  employee"  seems  to  suggest  that  the  statute
forbids  OSHA  from  permitting  risks  from  toxic  substances  even  if
only  one  or  a  few  workers  would  suffer  "material  impairment  of
health."  The  judicially  created  "significant  risk"  requirement,  by  con-
trast,  forbids  regulation  unless  enough  workers  will  be  affected  to
make  the  benefits  of  regulation  significant.  Nothing  in  the  legislative
history  supports  the  Court's  interpretation  of  the  definitional  clause,
and  indeed  the  history  argues  against  that interpretation. 35 7

Unable  to  point  to  a  solid  textual  basis  for  its  "significant  risk"

requirement,  the  plurality  invoked  a  clear-statement  principle:

In  the  absence  of  a  clear  mandate  in  the  Act,  it  is  unreasonable  to
assume that  Congress intended  to give  the Secretary the unprecedented
power  over  American  industry  that  would  result  from  the  Govern-
ment's  view  . .
. Expert  testimony  that  a  substance  is  probably  a
human  carcinogen  ...  would justify  the conclusion  that the substance
poses  some  risk  of  serious  harm  no  matter  how  minute  the  exposure

INTERPRETING STATUTES

and  no  matter  how  many  experts  testified  that they  regarded  the  risk
as  insignificant.  That  conclusion  would  in  turn justify  pervasive  reg-
ulation  limited  only  by  the  constraint  of  feasibility.  ... 
[T]he  Gov-
ernment's  theory  would  give  OSHA  power  to  impose  enormous  costs
that might  produce  little,  if  any,  discernable  benefit.35 8

The  plurality  further  suggested  that  the  government's  interpreta-
tion  would  give  the  Secretary  of  Labor  "open-ended"  policymaking
authority  that  might  amount  to  an  unconstitutional  delegation  of  leg-
islative  power.3 59

The  plurality's  conclusion  in  American  Petroleum  is  difficult  to
defend  in  either  formalist  or  textualist  terms.  The  "significant  risk"
requirement  has  no  textual  basis,  at  least  not  in  any  ordinary  sense;
it was  a  judicial  creation.  It  would  therefore  be possible  to  caricature
the  result  in  the  case  as  an  impermissible  judicial  rewriting  of  the
statute. 360  But  the  conclusion  in  the  case  was  nonetheless  sound.  A
realistic  interpretation  of  the  statutory  language  would  recognize  that
it  was  not  addressed  to  the  problem  at  hand.  It  is  simply  a  myth  to
suggest  that  the  Congress  that enacted  OSHA focused  on the  question
of  imposing  enormous  expenditures  to  redress  trivial  risks  -
recall
Wittgenstein's  game  of  dice.  Despite  the  broad-language  of the  toxic
substances  provision,  Congress  simply  did  not deal  with  the  problem.
In  these  circumstances,  the  plurality's  opinion  can  be  seen  as  in-
voking  several  of  the  substantive  norms  defended  above.  The  case
provided  an excellent  setting  for the  application  of the  principle  calling
for  de  minimis  exceptions  to  social  and  economic  regulation.  An
exclusive  focus  on  the  one  or  two  employees  who  suffer  "material
health  impairment"  as  a  result  of  a  lifetime  of  exposure  would  in  the
long  run  produce  less,  not more,  protection  of  workers. 3 61  If  OSHA
must  regulate  to  the  point  of feasibility  in  the  face  of  trivial  risk,  the
Department  of  Labor  will  be  reluctant  to  embark  on  any  regulation
at  all.

Moreover,  the  proportionality  principle  and  the  background  norm
counseling  avoidance  of  irrationality  both  argue  in  favor  of  the  plu-
rality's  reading.  The  beneficiaries  of  OSHA  regulation  are  well-or-
ganized  and  able  to  protect  themselves  in  the  implementation  process.

[Vol.  103:405

There  was  therefore  a  ready  political  corrective  both  to  the  plurality's
conclusion,  if it was  contrary  to  public  consensus,  and  to  inadequate
implementation  in  general.  For  all  these  reasons,  the  plurality  cor-
rectly  interpreted  OSHA  to  require  a  showing  of a  significant  risk  as
a predicate  for regulation. 362

In  American  Textile  Manufacturers Institute v.  Donovan,3 63  the
Supreme  Court  decided  a  question  left  open  in  American Petroleum:
whether  the  OSHA  statute  required  cost-benefit  analysis.  In  arguing
that  it  did,  the  industry  contended  that  the  word  "feasible"  required
OSHA  not  only  to  show  a  significant  risk,  but  also  to  demonstrate
that  the  benefits  of  regulation  justified  the  costs.  "Feasibility,"  in  the
industry's  view,  contemplated  a balancing  of costs  and  benefits.  The
government  contended  that  once  OSHA  had shown  a  significant  risk,
it  could  regulate  to  the  point  where  the  survival  of  the  regulated
industry  would  be  endangered  by  additional  controls.  For  the  gov-
ernment,  the  term  "feasibility"  did  not  connote  cost-benefit  balancing,
but  instead  meant  "possible." 3 64

In  accepting  the  government's  argument,  the  Court  relied  on  the
dictionary  definition  of  "feasible"  to  conclude  that  the  term  meant
"'capable  of  being  done,  executed,  or  effected,"'  rather  than  justified
by  a  balancing  of  costs  and  benefits. 3 65  This  literal  approach  to  the
statute  was  not  entirely  unreasonable.  The  structure  of  the  toxic
substances  provision  -
consider  the  "no  employee  shall  suffer"  lan-
guage  -
is  in  considerable  tension  with  the  industry's  construction.
Moreover,  Congress  has  sometimes  used  the  term  "feasible"  as  a self-
conscious  alternative  to  "cost-benefit"  balancing, 366  and  that  fact  ar-
gues  against  the  view  that  the  two  terms  have  the  same  meaning.
But  the  same  principles  that  support  the  decision  in  American Petro-
leum  cast  serious  doubt  on  American Textile  Manufacturers.

Notwithstanding  the  statute's  language,  it  is  probably  unrealistic
to  believe  that  Congress  actually  focused  on,  and  resolved,  the  ques-

362  A  different  result  might  be  appropriate  if  the  scientific  evidence  were  uncertain.  If  a
significant  risk  were  impossible  to  show  because  the  data  were  unclear,  perhaps  employers,
rather than  workers,  should bear  the burden  of medical  uncertainty.  The  plurality did not make
clear  how  such  considerations  would  bear  on  the  problem  of  carcinogen  regulation  if they  had
been  squarely  confronted  by  OSHA.

costs  but inquired  instead whether  the  regulation  would  prevent the  industry from  functioning.

INTERPPETING STATUTES

tion  whether  to  favor  the  government's  approach  over  some  kind  of
balancing  of costs  and  benefits.  The  question  never  arose  during  the
debates.  The  general  and  more  fundamental  problem  is  the  basic
irrationality  of  a  system  in  which  OSHA  is  required  to  find  a  signifi-
cant  risk,  but  is  prohibited  from  undertaking  cost-benefit  analysis.
Whether  a  risk  is  "significant"  depends  in  large  part  on  the  costs  of
eliminating  it.  A  relatively  small  risk  might  justify  regulation  if  the
costs  are  also  small,  but  a  larger  risk  might  best  be  left  unregulated
if  the  costs  are  enormous.  A  rational  system  of  regulation  looks  not
at  the  magnitude  of the  risk  alone,  but assesses  the  risk in  comparison
to  the  costs.

These  considerations  would  deserve  little  weight  if  the  statute
unambiguously  dictated  a  contrary  result,  but  the  word  "feasible"  is
flexible  enough  to  accommodate  a  proportionality  requirement.  By
refusing  to  read  the  statute  in  this  way,  the  Supreme  Court  has
contributed  to  the  irrationality  of the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health
Act  -
an  irrationality  that  has  harmed  workers,  employers,  consum-
ers,  and  the  public  at  large. 3 67

C.  Changed Circumstances or Obsolescence

When  circumstances  change,  statutory  interpretation  becomes  es-
pecially  difficult.  Older  statutes  may  depend  on  factual  assumptions
that  no  longer  hold,  or  may  conflict  with  more  recent  statutes,  thus
producing  inconsistency  and  incoherence  in  regulation.  This  problem
is  complicated  by the  fact that the  statutory term  may  have  been  clear
when  enacted,  and  at  that  time  it  may  have  been  inappropriate  to
invoke  controversial  substantive  norms  to  interpret, it;  but  changed
conditions  can  render  a  term  ambiguous  and  thus  make  it appropriate
to  apply  conspicuous  or  controversial  norms.  Because  it  represents  a
recurring  hard  case  for  statutory  interpretation,  the  confrontation  be-
tween  statutory  terms  and  new  or  unforeseen  contexts  deserves  sepa-
rate  treatment.

In  cases  of  changed  circumstances,  statutory  construction  appears
informed  by an  effort  to  ensure  integrity  and  coherence  in  the  law  by
"updating"  obsolete  statutes  -
or,  to  put  it  less  contentiously  and
probably  more  accurately,  by  interpreting  them  in  a  way  that  takes
account  of  changing  conditions. 36  Here  courts  reject  the  idea  that
the  original  understanding  of  its  audience  or  authors  exhausts  the
meaning  of  a  statute.  There  are  good  reasons  to  permit  courts  to  go
beyond  the  original  understanding  in the  face  of  dramatically  changed

circumstances,  at least when  the  statutory text is  ambiguous. 36 9  Such
an  approach  is  likely  to  produce  greater  coherence  in  the  law;  to
reduce  the  problem,  pervasive  in  modern  government,  of  regulation
by  measures  that  are  badly  out  of date;  and  to  lead  to  a legal  system
that  is  both  more  rational  and  more  consistent  with  democratic
norms. 370 
It  is  tempting  but  inadequate  to  say  that  the  legislature
should  respond  to  the  problem  of changed  circumstances.  The  ques-
tion  is  what  the  statute  means  in  those  circumstances,  and  that  ques-
tion must  be answered  by  those  who  interpret it,  including  the  courts.
This  claim  does  not,  of  course,  mean  that  changed  circumstances
should be  understood  to  authorize  courts  to  amend or rewrite  statutes,
but  it  does  mean  that  "meaning"  is  itself  a function  of  those  circum-
stances. 3 71

The  problem  of changed  circumstances  presents  questions  not  only
of statutory  meaning  in  new  settings,  but  also  of implicit  interpretive
instructions:  how  would  Congress  have  wanted  courts  to  approach  its
enactments  in  the  face  of  obsolescence  or  changed  circumstances?
There  will  rarely  be  a  direct  answer  to  this  question.  As  in  consti-
tutional  law,  the  problem  of changed  circumstances  requires  courts  to
decide  whether  the  content  of  legal  rules  should  change  when  there
have  been  changes  in  law,  policy,  and  fact.  At  the  very  least,  courts
should  answer  in  the  affirmative 3 72  when  a statute  contains  an  open-
ended  term  like  "public  policy"  or  "psychopathic '3 73  that  invites  in-
terpretations  that  change  over  time;  when  statutory  language  already
contains  an  ambiguous  term  ("feasible")  whose  meaning  depends  on
current  conditions; 374  or  when  the  statute  contains  a  phrase  ("induce
cancer")  that  has  been  rendered  ambiguous  because  of  changed  cir-
cumstances. 3 75

Even when  no  clear interpretive  instructions  allow a judge  to adapt
statutory  terms  to  new  conditions,  courts  may  do  so  when  those
conditions  have  rendered  a statute  ambiguous.  This  problem  typically
occurs  in  three  ways.  First,  the  factual  assumptions  underlying  the

that  changed  circumstances  have  traditionally  provided  a  rationale  for  departing  from  stare
decisis).

370  See  sources  cited  supra notes  224-28.
371  Dean  Calabresi  has  argued  that  courts  should  have  the  power  to  invalidate  obsolete
statutes  and  to  return  them  to  the  legislature  for  reconsideration.  See  G.  CALABRESI,  supra
note  82,  at  163-66.  A  judicial  role  of  this  sort would  be  extremely  controversial,  and  properly
so.  The  principal problem  posed  by  obsolescence  or  changed  circumstances  is  that it complicates
ordinary  interpretation.

INTERPRETING STATUTES

original  statute  may  no  longer  be  valid.  For  example,  statutes  regu-
lating broadcasting  were  enacted  with  the  understanding  that because
of the  limitations  of the spectrum,  few broadcasting  licenses  would  be
available.  In  the  face  of  new  technology  and  the  rise  of  cable  tele-
vision,  that  assumption  has  become  hopelessly  unrealistic.

Second,  a  statutory  provision  may  no  longer  be  consistent  with
widely  held  social  norms.  In  such  cases  a  court  must  ask  whether
this  change  so  alters  the  landscape  that  a  reading  of  the  statute  that
does  not  accord  with  the  original  understanding  of  its  authors  is
justified -
a question  the  enacting  legislature  may well  have  intended
courts  to  answer  in  the  affirmative.

Third,  the  legal  background  may  have  changed  dramatically  as  a
result  of legislative  and  administrative  innovations.  A  statute  enacted
in  1935  may  have  ignored  environmental  considerations  widely  rec-
ognized  in  statutes  enacted  after  I96O.  The  question  is  whether  the
change  in  the  legal  background  has  consequences  for  interpreting  the
1935  statute.

Judicial  responses  to all  three  kinds  of obsolescence  are  not difficult
to  find.  The first  kind  has  resulted  in  aggressive  construction,  partic-
ularly  in  banking  and  broadcasting. 3 76  In  light of the changed  nature
of  the  relevant  markets,  it  is  implausible  to  resolve  ambiguities  by
examining  Congress'  intent  at  the  time  of  enactment.  Such  an  ap-
proach  would  be  a  recipe  for  absurdity,  and  absurdity  would  hardly
promote  legislative  purposes.

The second  form  of obsolescence  is reflected  in judicial construction
of  statutes  of  the  192o's  and  1930's  so  as  to  require  old-line  agencies
to  take  account  of environmental  concerns.  In  this  context,  the  legal
backdrop  has  changed  so  dramatically  that seemingly  straightforward
interpretation  of the  old statutes  would  be  undesirable. 3 77  The  same
point  helps  to  explain  the courts'  narrow  construction  of provisions  of
the  UCC  not  anticipating  the  revolution  in  the  law  of  products  lia-
bility.3 78  The  Court's  decision  in  Bob  Jones can  be  understood  in
similar  terms.  Changing  legislative  and  judicial  developments  had
made  racial  discrimination  inconsistent  with  "public  policy"  in  the
r98o's,  even  if  no  such  inconsistency  existed  when  the  charitable
deduction  was  first  enacted.

Decisions reading  ambiguous  statutes  to require  regulatory  agencies
to  consider  costs  and  benefits  illustrate  the  third  form  of  judicial
response  to  obsolescence. 3 79  The  Court  may  also  have  been  reflecting

contemporary  values  in  reading  the  Sherman  Act  as  an  effort  to
promote  consumer  welfare. 38 0  The  underlying  argument  would  be
that  a  welfare-based  interpretive  principle  is  the  only  basis  for  a
judicially  administrable  standard,  and  that such  a principle  conforms
best  to  current  understandings  about  a  well-functioning  antitrust
law.38 1

Several  substantive  norms  apply to cases  of obsolescence.  Obsolete
statutes  are  by  hypothesis  inconsistent  with  other  regulation  or  with
the  current  legal  framework.  They  may  also  have  pernicious,  if  un-
intended,  systemic  effects.  If  the  text  allows,  courts  should  attempt
to  harmonize  such  statutes  with  current  circumstances.

We  might  explore  the  problem  of  obsolescence  in  more  detail  by
examining  the  Delaney  Clause.  As  noted  above,  the  clause  prohibits
the  sale  of  food  additives  that  "induce  cancer  when  ingested  by  man
or  animal"  or  are  found  "after  tests  which  are  appropriate  for  the
evaluation  of  the  safety  of  food  additives,  to  induce  cancer  in  man
and  animal." 382  As  we  have  seen,  the  drafters  of the  clause  believed
that  few  additives  caused  cancer,  and  that  those  that  did  so  were
extremely  dangerous.  By  the  I98o's,  however,  it was  clear  that  many
substances  were  carcinogenic,  but  that  a  number  of  them  created
exceptionally  minor  risks. 38 3

These  developments  severely  undermined  the  assumptions  of  the
Congress  that  enacted  the  Delaney  Clause.  Indeed  the  clause,  read
literally,  appeared  quite  perverse  in  many  of  its  applications  because
it  banned  substances  that  posed  no  real  risk  to  health.  Having  been
forbidden  to  use  food  additives  posing  a  de  minimis  risk  of  cancer,

380 See,  e.g.,  R.  BoRm, 

supra note  337,  at  72-89.  A  similar  method  was  at  work  in  King
v.  Smith,  392  U.S.  309  (1968),  in  which  the  Supreme  Court  invalidated  a  state  rule  depriving
women  of  welfare  benefits  whenever  they  lived  with  a  man -
even  if cohabitation  occurred  as
rarely  as  once  a  month.  Although  there  had been  a  steady trend  in  the direction  of eliminating
moral  requirements  for  welfare  recipients,  and  although  the "man-in-the-house"  rule  had  been
widely  condemned  as  irrational,  punitive,  and  probably  both  sexist  and  racist  in  operation,  the
Court  was  unable  to  point  to  any  statutory  provision  that  unambiguously  invalidated  the  state
rule.  The decision  in King v.  Smith amounted  to  an  aggressive  reading  of the statute  to  conform
to  what  the  Court  understood  to  be  the  current  (and  well-founded)  national  consensus.

INTERPRETING STATUTES

manufacturers  instead  used  additives  that  caused  more  serious  risks
of other  diseases -
thus creating  what was  quite  possibly  a significant
increase  in  illnesses  and  deaths  from food  additives.  In  response,  the
FDA  -
invoking  background  principles  against  obsolescence  and  in
favor  of rationality  and  de minimis  exception  -
interpreted  the  clause
to  permit the  exemption  of trivial  risks.  The  claim,  in  short,  was  that
changed circumstances  made  the word "induce" ambiguous.  The FDA
said  that  it  would  approve  food  additives  that  posed  a  de  minimis
risk  of cancer.

The  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  District  of  Columbia
held  that  the  FDA's  position  was  unlawful. 3 84  In  that  court's  view,
the  Delaney  Clause  was  unambiguous  on  the  point.  Read  in  context,
however,  the  statute's  meaning  was  far from  clear.  Because  Congress
did  not  focus  on  the  question  of  de  minimis  risks  in  its  original
enactment,  a de minimis  exception  would not  have  defeated  Congress'
will.  The  factual  background  against  which  the  Delaney  Clause  was
written  was  so  different  from  the  present  circumstances  that  the  sta-
tutory terms "induce  cancer"  must be treated  as  ambiguous.  The word
"induce"  should  be  read  in  its  setting:  whether  a  substance  "induces"
cancer  within  the  meaning  of  the  clause  might  well  be  a  function  of
the  degree  of risk  that  it  poses.  We  have  seen  that  where  there  has
been  no  clear  legislative  statement,  agencies  should  be  free  to  create
de  minimis  exceptions  to regulation.  In  these  circumstances,  interpre-
tation  of  the  clause  to  permit  such  exceptions  seems  consistent  with
permissible  understandings  of  statutory  construction,  and  quite  sen-
sible  to  boot.  The  D.C.  Circuit's  decision  to  the  contrary  was  there-
fore  misguided.

D.  Priority and Harmonization

It  will  not  have  escaped  notice  that  the  interpretive  principles  I
have  proposed  will sometimes  conflict  with one  another.  For example,
the  principle  favoring  state  authority  might  collide  with  the  principle
favoring  disadvantaged  groups,  and  the  presumption  against  amend-
ment through the  appropriations  process  might contradict  the principle
in  favor  of  generous  construction  of  statutes  protecting  nonmarket
values.  The  examples  could  easily  be  multiplied.  The  possibility  of
conflict  renders  the  basic  approach  vulnerable  to  a  neo-realist  objec-
tion that,  in practice,  the  interpretive  norms will  provide  contradictory
guidance  for  the  judiciary.

Principles  of  harmonization  and  priority  can  in  fact  be  developed
to  resolve  cases  of  conflict.  To  make  this  claim  is  not,  however,  to
say  that  the  application  of interpretive  norms  can  be  purely  mechan-

ical.  Inevitably,  statutory  construction  is  an  exercise  of practical  rea-
son,  in  which  text,  history,  and  purpose  interact  with  background
understandings  in  the  legal  culture. 3 85  In  light  of  the  dependence  of
outcomes  on  particular  contexts,  a  fully  systematized  approach  to
statutory  construction  would  be  unmanageable.  But  short  of  a  com-
plete  system,  it is  possible  to  develop  some  guidelines.

i.  Priority. - The  first  task  is  to  develop  principles  by  which  to
rank interpretive  norms.  Although  different judges  and  administrators
will  rank such norms  in different ways,  it should  be possible  to  achieve
a  more  precise  understanding  of  statutory  construction  -
both  as  a
descriptive  and  as  a  normative  matter  -
by  generating  a  hierarchy
of interpretive  principles.

In  that  hierarchy,  the  presumptions  in  favor  of  decisions  by  polit-
ically  accountable  actors  and  in  favor  of political  deliberation  should
occupy  the very highest place.  The principle  of political  accountability
has  a  clear  foundation  in  article  I  of the  Constitution,  is  an  overriding
structural  commitment  of  the  document,  has  roots  in  assessments  of
institutional  performance, 3 86  and  is  also  designed  to  counteract  char-
acteristic  failures  in  the  regulatory  process. 3 87  In  this sense,  the  norm
of political  accountability  draws  on  all  three  basic  sources  of interpre-
tive  principles.

The  commitment  to  political  deliberation  belongs  on  the  same
plane.  The  belief  in  deliberative  democracy  is  also  a  basic  constitu-
tional  commitment. 388  Implicit  in  the  systems  of checks  and  balances
and  federalism,  it  draws  on  Madison's  conception  of  political  repre-
sentation.  The  absence  of  deliberation  has  also  contributed  to  regu-
latory failure. 38 9  In  these  ways,  the  belief in political  deliberation  and
the  belief  in  political  accountability  are  closely  allied.

Other  interpretive  principles  traceable  to  constitutional  norms  de-
serve  great  respect.  They  should  occupy  the  next  highest  position  in
the  hierarchy.  This  category  would  include  the  norms  in  favor  of
broad  interpretation  of  statutes  protecting  disadvantaged  groups,
against  delegations  of legislative  authority,  in favor  of state  autonomy,
and  in  favor  of  narrow  construction  of  interest-group  transfers.  As
we  have  seen,  all  of these  principles  have  constitutional  status  but are
underenforced  as  a  result  of  the  institutional  position  of  the  judi-
ciary.3 90  Moreover,  it is  possible  to  create  a kind  of hierarchy  within
constitutionally  based  interpretive  principles.  Thus,  for  example,  the

INTERPRETING STATUTES

principle  in  favor  of state  autonomy  should  occupy  a lower  place  than
the  principle  in  favor  of protection  of disadvantaged  groups,  which  is
the  product  of the  fourteenth  amendment,  a  self-conscious  attempt  to
limit  the  scope  of  state  power.  The  case  law  in  fact  reflects  this
hierarchy.391

Finally,  interpretive  principles  without  constitutional  status  should
occupy  the  lowest  rung,  precisely  because  the  judgments  they  repre-
sent  are  not  so  closely  connected  with  the  foundational  commitments
of American  constitutionalism.  This  category  includes  norms  in  favor
of  coordination  and  of  proportionality,  norms  requiring  consideration
of systemic  effects,  norms  against  implied  repeals,  and  norms  against
obsolescence.  All  these  norms  should  play  a  less  significant  role  in
cases  of  conflict.  Moreover,  these  principles  might  themselves  be
placed  in  lexical  order.  For  example,  the  principles  calling  for  de
minimis  exceptions  and  for  proportionality,  and  for  taking account  of
systemic  effects,  should  occupy  the  highest  position  among  nonconsti-
tutional  principles.  To use  (for example)  the principle  calling for broad
construction  of  statutes  favoring  nonmarket  values  as  a  reason  to
abandon  proportionality  would  sacrifice  those  very  values  -
because
of  the  likelihood  that  stringent  regulation  that  bars  balancing  will
produce  regulatory  irrationality and,  ultimately, underregulation.  The
background  principles  calling  for  proportionality  and  de  minimis  ex-
ceptions,  and  requiring  consideration  of  systemic  effects,  should  or-
dinarily  apply  unless  a  constitutional  principle  trumps  them.

2.  Harmonization. - Principles  of harmonization  are  designed  not
to  rank  interpretive  norms  but  to  minimize  the  number  of  conflicts
among  norms.  For  example,  courts  should  apply  the  proportionality
principle  differently  when  nonmarket  values  are  at stake.  In  cases  of
economic  regulation,  translating  costs  and  benefits  into  dollars,  mea-
sured  in  terms  of  private  willingness  to  pay,  is  entirely  sensible.  In
cases  implicating  nonmonetary  values,  the  fact  that  monetized  costs
and  benefits  are  disproportionate  is  not controlling.  Reflecting  a sim-
ilar  understanding,  the  courts  have  interpreted  statutes  quite  gener-
ously,  and  in  a  way  that  conspicuously  departs  from  private  willing-
ness 
to  pay,  when  aspirations  and  noncommodity  values  are
involved. 39 2

Another principle  of harmonization  would recognize  that  cases turn
not  simply  on  the  applicability  of interpretive  norms,  but  also  on  the
degree  of their  infringement.  Thus,  for  example,  an  enormous  grant
of discretionary  lawmaking  power  to  a regulatory  agency  would argue
more  strongly  in  favor  of  an  aggressive  narrowing  construction  than
a  minor  grant  of  such  power.  Moreover,  if  the  norm  in  favor  of

[Vol.  103:405

limited  delegations  conflicts  with  the  norm in  favor  of coordination  of
regulatory  policy,  the degree  of the  infringement  on  both norms  would
be  highly  relevant  to  the  decision.

3.  An  Illustration -

Pennhurst.  - Pennhurst State  School  &
Hospital v.  Halderman3 93  illustrates  the  operation  of  principles  of
priority  and  harmonization.  In  Pennhurst, a  group  of  mentally  re-
tarded  people  brought  suit  against  a  mental  health  facility  that  was
found  to  contain  dangerous  conditions.  Many  of  the  residents  had
been  physically  abused,  brutally  mistreated,  or  drugged;  the  facility
was  utterly  inadequate  for the  treatment  of the  retarded.  As  the  basis
of  their  legal  claim,  the  plaintiffs  invoked  the  "bill  of  rights"  in  the
Developmentally  Disabled  Assistance  and  Bill  of  Rights  Act. 3 94  The
bill  of  rights  contained  a  set  of  legislative  findings,  including  the
following:

(i) Persons  with  developmental  disabilities  have  a right to  appropriate
treatment,  services,  and  habilitation  for  such  disabilities.

(2) The  treatment,  services,  and  habilitation  for  a  person  with  devel-
opmental  disabilities  should  be  designed  to  maximize  the  develop-
mental  potential  of  the  person  and  should  be  provided  in  a  setting
that  is  least  restrictive  of the  person's  personal  liberty.

(3) The  Federal  Government  and  the  States  both  have  an  obligation
to  assure  that  public  funds  are  not  provided  to  any  institution]...
that]  does  not  provide  treatment,  services,  and  habilitation  which  is
appropriate  to  the  needs  of  such  persons .... 

395

The  question  in  Pennhurst was  whether  the  bill  of  rights  created
legally  enforceable  rights,  or whether  it instead  enacted  a set  of  goals
or  aspirations  that  could  not be  vindicated  in  court.  The  history  of
the  Act  supported  an  argument  that  Congress  intended  to  create  le-
gally  cognizable  rights. 39 6  On  the  other hand,  it was  not  unreasonable
to  suggest  that  the  bill  of  rights  should  be  taken,  like  some  other
prefaces  to  legislation,  as  a  statement  of  goals  and  purposes  that
amounted  to  an  essentially  precatory  statement  of  congressional  aspi-
rations  -
a  statement  that  would  not  permit  the  developmentally
disabled  to  bring  suit  against  a  facility  that  failed  to  respect  the  bill
of rights.  There  was no  affirmative  indication  that  the "findings"  were
intended  to  give  rise  to  legally  enforceable  rights,  costing  the  state
enormous  sums.  Without  a  background  interpretive  principle,  the
case  was  probably  impossible  to  resolve.

INTERPRETING STATUTES

In  holding  for  the  governmental  defendant,  the  Supreme  Court
did  not  deny  that  the  conventional  sources  of  interpretation  left  the
Instead  it  invoked  a  background  principle:  "[I]f
case  in  equipoise. 
Congress  intends  to impose  a  condition  on the  grant of federal  moneys,
it  must  do  so  unambiguously.  By insisting  that  Congress  speak  with
a  clear  voice,  we  enable  the  States  to  exercise  their  choice  knowingly,
cognizant  of  the  consequences  of  their  participation. '3 97  The  Court
decided  Pennhurst on  the  basis  of  an  interpretive  norm  derived  from
the  constitutional  background,  not  from  the  statute  at  issue.

For  reasons  explored  above,  federalism  principles  are  properly
invoked,  at  least  in  ordinary  settings,  to  require  a  clear  statement
from  Congress  for  the  imposition  of  significant  duties  on  the  states.
If  the  Court  had  held  the  bill  of  rights  legally  enforceable,  the  states
would  have  faced  an  enormous  financial  burden  -
one  that  they  had
not,  in  view  of  the  statute's  ambiguity,  necessarily  expected  to  incur.
It  is  for  this reason  that  the  outcome  in  Pennhurst is  a  plausible  one.
But  two  considerations  suggest  that  Pennhurst was  incorrectly  de-
cided.

First,  a  constitutional  norm  calls  for  aggressive  construction  of
statutes  involving  the  developmentally  disabled.  The  Court  has  been
extremely  cautious  in  using  the  Constitution  to  protect  the  disabled,
largely  for  institutional  reasons. 398 
In  holding  that  the  equal  protec-
tion  clause  does  not  entitle  the  mentally  retarded  to  special  judicial
protection,  for  example,  the  Court  stressed  that  federal  and  state
legislatures  have  responded  to  the  pervasive  mistreatment  of  the  re-
tarded,  and  that  unelected  judges  should  be  reluctant  to  intrude  so
dramatically  into  democratic  processes. 3 99  In  these  circumstances,  the
best  substantive  theory  of the  equal  protection  clause  accords  special
protection  to  the  disabled,  and  when  other  branches  give  such  pro-
tection,  they  are  fulfilling  their  constitutional  responsibilities.

Second,  federalism  principles  have  much  less  force  in  cases  in
which  Congress  attempts  to  protect  a  traditionally  disadvantaged
group  from  state  political  processes.  The  ordinary  presumption  in
favor  of  state  autonomy  is  countered  by  the  fourteenth  amendment
-
a  self-conscious  limitation  on  state  power.  Invocation  of principles
of  state  autonomy  in  the  context  of  a  socially  subordinated  group  -
to  justify  a  narrow  reading  of  a  statute  enacted  on  its  behalf  -
is
positively  perverse  in  light  of  constitutional  structure  and  history. 40 0

400 To  be  sure,  this  conclusion  depends  on  the (controversial)  view  that  the developmentally
disabled  should  for  these  purposes  be  treated  the  same  as  blacks,  the  unquestionable  principal
beneficiaries  of the  fourteenth  amendment.  But  that  view  should  not be  difficult  to  defend  in
light  of  the  past and  present  treatment  of the  developmentally  disabled,  treatment  that  led  to

[Vol.  103:405

It  follows  that  when  Congress  has  taken  steps  to  provide  safe-
guards  for  that  group,  the  Court  should  take  into  account  the  four-
teenth  amendment  and  the  underenforced  character  of  the  equality
norm  in  order  to  give  statutes  involving  the  disabled  a  hospitable
rather  than  a grudging  interpretation. 40 1  The  Pennhurst Court  should
not  have  relied  on  a  background  norm in  favor  of federalism  in  order
to  render  meaningless  a  statutory  provision  involving  a  group  and  a
right  safeguarded  by the  fourteenth  amendment. 40 2

E.  A  Concluding Note: The  Post-Canonical Universe

What  would  the  universe  of  statutory  interpretation  be  like  if  all
of  these  proposals  were  accepted? 
In  one  sense,  it  would  not  be
dramatically  different  from  the  one  we  inhabit.  All  of the  principles
suggested  here  have  some  foundations  in  current  law.  A  system  of
interpretation  without interpretive  norms,  even  substantive  and  insti-
tutional  ones,  would  be  inconceivable.  On  the  other  hand,  a  legal
system  that  adopted  such  principles  self-consciously  would  have  a far
greater  degree  of  uniformity  and  coherence.  It  would  be  especially
responsive  to  constitutional  norms,  to institutional  considerations,  and
to  an  informed  understanding  of  the  functions  and  failures  of  the
modern  regulatory  state.  Above  all,  the  system  would  rely  on  norms
that  promote  the  goals  and that improve  the  performance  of statutory
regimes,  and  it  would  use  the  process  of  statutory  construction  as  a
corrective  against  some  of  the  pervasive  weaknesses,  injustices,  and
irrationalities  of modern  regulation.

In  all  likelihood,  a  set  of  explicitly  articulated  interpretive  norms
would  elicit  administrative  and  legislative  responses.  In  time,  mem-
bers  of  Congress,  and  others  involved  in  the  lawmaking  process,
would  become  aware  of  those  norms  and  would  enact  statutes  in  the
shadow  of such  norms.  Some  statutes  would  look  quite  different,  for
Congress  would  know  that  courts  would,  in  the  face  of  statutory
silence  or  ambiguity,  press  legislation  in  one  direction  rather  than
another.403  Judicial  adoption  of interpretive  norms  of this  sort  would

Difference,  22  HARv.  C.R.-C.L.  L.  REv.  III,  144-52  (1987).

401  But  cf.  Santa  Clara  Pueblo  v.  Martinez,  436  U.S.  49  (1978)  (upholding  tribal  sovereign

immunity  against  equal  protection  claim  under  the Indian  Civil  Rights  Act).

402  Principles  of priority  and  harmonization  were  also  at  work  in  Bob  Jones  University  v.
United  States,  461  U.S.  574  (1983).  See  supra note  ioo.  That  decision  reflects  an  implicit
understanding  that  the  nonsubordination  principle  trumps  the  interest  in  the  autonomy  of
religious  organizations,  at  least  in the  context  of tax policy.

403  In  light  of the  absence  of  solid  evidence  that  legislative  activity  is  materially  affected  by
interpretive  norms  in  general,  this effect  would,  however,  probably  not  be  as  great  as one  might
expect.

INTERPRETING STATUTES

ultimately  shift  the  burden  of  legislative  inertia -
giving  rationality
of  various  sorts  the  benefit  of  the  doubt,  and  raising  the  costs  of
absurdity  or  injustice  -
and  at the  same  time  would  offer  legislators
and  others  a  clear  rather  than  murky  background  against  which  to
do  their  work.

The  interpretive  norms  suggested  here  would  convert  some  hard
cases  into  easy  ones,  by  providing  principles  with  which  to  decide
cases  that  might  otherwise  be  in  equipoise.  Examples  include  cases
like  American  Petroleum, which  involved  the  operation  of  the  pro-
portionality  principle,  and  cases  involving  allegations  of  preemption,
which  implicate  the  principle  in  favor  of  state  autonomy.  But  the
norms  would  also  make  some  easy  cases  into  hard  ones,  by  shifting
the  legal  backdrop  and  requiring  clear  legislative  instructions  before
certain  results  could  be  reached.  For  this  reason,  a legal  framework
pervaded  by explicit  background  norms of the  sort outlined here  would
in  some  settings  create  rather  than  diminish legal  uncertainty. 40 4  This
cost,  however,  is  a small price  to  pay for  increased  clarity in  a variety
of  contexts,  and,  much  more  fundamentally,  an  improvement  in  the
performance  of regulatory  law, an  increase  in rationality,  and a greater
sensitivity  to  the  constitutional  backdrop,  statutory  function,  and  reg-
ulatory  failure.

V.  CONCLUSION

The  traditional  understandings  of statutory  construction  are  inad-
equate.  They  fail  to  describe  existing  practice  or  to  set  out  an  ap-
proach  that  deserves  support.  Under  the  approach  suggested  here,
the  statutory  text  is  the  foundation  for  interpretation,  but  structure,
purpose,  intent,  history,  and "reasonableness"  all  play legitimate  roles.
It is  possible,  moreover,  to  distinguish  among  those  roles,  and  thus  to
produce  a  system  in  which  dictionary  definitions  of  statutory  terms
ordinarily suffice,  but  are  subject  to  various  forms  of contextual  qual-
ification.

As  complete  theories  of  interpretation,  however,  all  of  the  tradi-
tional  sources  depend  on  fictions  or  leave  large  interpretive  gaps.
Efforts  to  approach  statutes  as  "deals,"  or  to  justify  a  general  back-
ground rule  in  favor  of either  administrative  interpretation  or "private
ordering, '40 5  cannot be  defended,  for they produce  indeterminacy,  lead

404  The  Delaney  Clause  might  be  an  example.  On  one  understanding  of  a  textualist  ap-
proach,  the case  is  an  easy  one,  and the  FDA loses;  it is  the norm against de  minimis  exceptions
that  introduces  uncertainty  into  a  case  that  might  be  otherwise  resolved  on  the  basis  of  the
"text."

40S  The  quotation  marks  are  necessary  because  of  the  dependence  of  private  ordering  on
a  prominent  New  Deal  theme.  See  Sunstein,  supra  note  9,  at  437-38,  451-

to  an  inferior  system of law,  or depend  on  values  that were  repudiated
by  the  decision  to  create  the  regulatory  regime  in  the  first  instance.

Because  language  "by  itself"  lacks  meaning,  and  in  light  of  the
existence  of gaps  or  ambiguities  in  hard  cases,  interpretive  principles
of  various  sorts  are  desirable  and  in  any  case  inevitable.  Interpreta-
tion  cannot  occur  without  background  principles  that fill  gaps  in  the
face  of legislative  silence  and  provide  the  backdrop  against  which  to
read linguistic  commands.  In  easy cases,  the  text,  in  conjunction  with
generally  held  interpretive  principles,  is  enough  to  solve  interpretive
disputes;  in  other  cases,  also  relatively  easy,  a  resort  to  purpose,
context  -
or  reasonableness  will  be
proper,  necessary,  and  sufficient.  In  many  cases,  however,  courts
must  invoke  interpretive  principles  that  appear  controversial.

including  legislative  history  -

Some  such  principles  aid  courts  in  discerning  the  meaning  of par-
ticular  statutes,  or  help  to  implement  Congress'  actual  or  likely  in-
terpretive  instructions.  Others  are  rooted  in  constitutional  concerns;
others derive from  assessments of institutional  performance;  still others
attempt  to  respond  to  characteristic  failings  of  regulatory  legislation.
Because  statutory  meaning  is  a function  of interpretive  principles  and
cannot  exist  without  them,  something  like  "canons"  of  construction,
far  from  being  obsolete,  must  occupy  a prominent  place  in  the  theory
and  practice  of statutory  interpretation.

In  these  circumstances,  it  is  especially  important  to  avoid  thiee
common  errors.  The  first  is  to  treat  interpretive  principles  as  the
illegitimate  intrusion  of discretionary  policy judgments  into "ordinary"
interpretation;  as  we  have  seen,  there  is  no  such  thing.  The  second
is  to  think that  the existence  of competing,  and value-laden,  principles
is  a  reason  to  give  up  on  the  enterprise  of  statutory  construction
altogether,  and  in  hard  cases  to  resort  to  a  sometimes  fictional  "plain
language,"  to  treat  interpretation  as  inevitably  indeterminate,  or  to
rest  content  with  the  conclusion  that  statutes  turn  out  to  mean  what
people  in  authority  say  that  they  mean.  Even  in  hard  cases,  it  is
possible  to  mediate  among  competing  principles  and  to  assess  them  in
terms  of  their  sensitivity  to  constitutional  structure,  to  institutional
arrangements,  and  to  regulatory  function  and failure.  The  third error
is  to  use  traditional  principles  of  private  law  -
carried  over  from
anachronistic  conceptions  of  the  relationship  between  the  citizen  and
the  state  -
to  resolve  disputes  about  the  meaning  of modern  enact-
ments.

The  interpretive  principles  suggested  here  are  intended  for  the
President,  regulatory  agencies,  and  Congress,  as well  as  for the  courts.
Even  more  fundamentally,  they  provide  a basis for  understanding  the
ideas  that  underlie  the  fabric  of the  modern  regulatory  state.  Indeed,
it  is  in  disputes  over  background  norms  of  interpretation  that  one
finds  principles  that  organize  and  divide  understandings  not  only  of

INTERPRETING STATUTES

The  ultimate  task  is  to  develop  a  set  of  interpretive  norms  -
sensitive  to  constitutional  structure,  institutional  design,  the  New  Deal
reformation,  and  the  diverse  functions  and  failings  of  governmental
actors  and statutory  regimes 40 6 - with  which  to  approach  social  and
economic  regulation  in  a  system  that  has  largely  abandoned  common
law  categories.  It  is  possible  to  generate  a series  of interpretive  prin-
ciples,  all  with  support  in  current  law,  that  can  promote  the  goals  of
deliberative  government  in  the  post-New  Deal  period.  In  this  way,
statutory  construction  can  serve  as  an  ally  of  other,  more  ambitious
strategies  designed  to  promote  some  of the  original  constitutional  goals
in  a  dramatically  changed  legal  environment.  It  is  far  too  much  to
expect  statutory  construction  to  respond  to  all  of  the  failings  of  the
modern  regulatory  state.  But  it  is  not  too  much  to  expect  that  the
process  of  interpretation  can  make  the  situation  better  rather  than
worse.

406  See  Pound,  Common Law  and  Legislation, supra note  4,  at  386  (deploring  the  courts'
failure  to  conceive  of  statutes  "as  entering  into  the  legal  system  as  an  organic  whole"  and  the
judicial  treatment  of  statutes  "as introducing  a  sort  of temporary  innovation  which  is  not  at all
to  be  thought  of  as  on  the  same  footing  with  common  law  doctrines");  see  also  Stone,  The
Common Law  in the  United States, 5o HARv. L.  REv. 4,  i5 (1936)  ("[A]  statute  is  not an  alien
intruder  in  the  house  of  the common  law,  but a  guest  to  be  welcomed  and  made  at  home  there
as  a  new  and powerful  aid  in  the  accomplishment  of its  appointed  task  of  accommodating  the
law  to  social  needs.").
