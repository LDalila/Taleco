INTRODUCTION

Throughout  its  brief  history,  administrative  law  has  often  been
concerned  with  the question whether  the name  of its  own  subject  is an
oxymoron.  We  might  distinguish  among three  positions  on  that ques-
tion.  The  first  treats  law  and  administration  as  largely  incompatible;
the second sees  traditional legal checks as a bulwark  against administra-
tive  tyranny;  the  third  suggests  that  these  traditional  checks  must  be
adapted  to  the  values,  functions,  and  failures  of  the  administrative
state.

The  incompatibility  of law  and  administration  was  a  prominent
theme  during  the  1920s  and  the  New  Deal  period,  which  produced  a
fundamental  reformation  in  the  structure  of American  constitutional-
ism.'  Indeed, the creation of the administrative  state was largely  a self-
conscious  repudiation  of legalism.  The  New  Deal  reformers  believed
that  modern  problems  required  institutions  having  flexibility,  exper-
tise,  managerial  capacity,  political  accountability,  and  powers  of initia-
tive  far  beyond  those  of  the  courts.  On  this  view,  the  appropriate
response  of  the  legal  system  to  the  rise  of administration  is  one  of
retreat.2

The  view  that  legal  checks,  in  their  traditional  form,  are  an indis-
pensable  constraint  on regulatory  administration  played  a  large role in
the  constitutional  assault  on  the  administrative  state 3  and,  in  more
modest  form,  helped  give  rise  to  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act
("APA") 4  in  1946. 5  This  view  can  also  be  found  in  the  old  idea,  per-

tionalism After the New  Deal,  101  Harv.  L. Rev. 421,  422-25 (1987).  Thus  it is  that the
modem justiciability  doctrines-most  notably,  limitations  on  standing  and  reviewabil-
ity-owe their origin to this  period,  not to the framing.  See, e.g.,  FCC v.  CBS,  311  U.S.
132,  136  (1940)  (reviewability);  Myers  v.  Bethlehem  Shipbuilding  Corp.,  303  U.S.  41,

tive institutions).

haps  enjoying a renaissance,  that statutes  in derogation of the common
law  should  be  narrowly  construed. 6  On  this  account,  legal  checks  of
the pre-New  Deal  sort are  a crucial  mechanism  for domesticating regu-
lation by  limiting  governmental  interference  with  private  markets  and
by promoting  a  range of original  constitutional  goals.  Hearing  rights,
independent judicial  interpretation  of law,  separation  of functions,  and
procedural  safeguards  are  all  necessary  quid pro  quos  for the  creation
of administrative  agencies  combining  traditionally  separated  functions
and  exercising  broad  discretionary  authority.'

A  number  of observers  have  argued  that  law  should  continue  to
play a large  role in the administrative state,  but that it must be  adapted
to  take account  of the new forms and  values  represented  by  the rise of
social and economic regulation.8  On this view,  regulatory controls pro-
tecting interests  such as  environmental  quality, nondiscrimination,  safe
work places,  and fair trade practices  should be treated hospitably by the
legal culture.  This view can be found in a number of ideas:  that private
law  principles  ought  not to  play a  large  role in  administrative law;  that
courts  should  attempt  to  prevent  arbitrary  or  overzealous  regulation,
but also  to  help  bring  about regulatory  controls when  they are  legally
required;  that courts should  attempt both to promote  the goals of regu-
lation, understood  in  a public-regarding  way,  and  to  ensure  against  its
pathologies.  Here  the  relationship  of law  to  administration  is  neither
acquiescence  nor hostility  but  instead  adaptation.

All of these views  have  played a large  role in legal  developments  of
the last two  decades.  In particular, the view  that law and administration

271,  271-73  (1947),  and  sources  cited  therein.  See  generally  Verkuil,  The  Emerging
Concept of Administrative  Procedure,  78  Colum.  L. Rev.  258,  268-74  (1978)  (discuss-
ing the  Walter-Logan  Bill,  an  earlier  proposal  to limit  administrative  agencies  that laid
the foundation  for  the APA).

Consider  in this regard  Roscoe  Pound's claim  that autonomous  administration  is  a
"Marxian  idea"  or a system of "administrative  absolutism,"  in Dodd,  Garfield, Maguire,
McGuire  & Pound,  Report  of the  Special  Committee  on  Administrative  Law,  63  Ann.
Rep.  A.B.A.  331,  339-40  (1938).

Law,  3 Vand.  L. Rev. 438,440-41  (1950).  For cases  suggesting a possible  modern revi-
val  of  narrow  interpretation  of regulatory  statutes,  see  Independent  Fed'n  of  Flight
Attendants  v.  Zipes,  109  S. Ct.  2732,  2735-37  (1989)  (narrowly  construing Title  VII
attorneys'  fees provision); Wards  Cove Packing Co.  v.  Atonio, 109  S. Ct. 2115,  2123-27

construing  Developmentally  Disabled  Assistance  and  Bill  of Rights  Act).

are incompatible has  enjoyed  a  revival-ironically,  mostly at the hands
of people with little sympathy for regulation in general  or the New  Deal
reformation  in particular.9  This view can be found in the revival  of seri-
ous limits  on standing  to review  administrative  action,  on reviewability
of agency inaction,  and  on the  courts'  ability  to  impose  procedural  re-
quirements  beyond  those  in  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act.' 0  But
of all of the Supreme  Court's decisions  raising  issues of this  sort, by far
the  most  important  is  Chevron  U.S.A.  Inc.  v.  Natural Resources  Defense
Council, Inc.' 1

In  Chevron,  the  Court  established  that  "[i]f...  Congress  has  not
directly  addressed  the precise  question  at issue,"  courts  should  accept
reasonable  administrative interpretations  of law. 12 The  Chevron princi-
ple means  that in the face  of ambiguity, agency interpretations  will pre-
vail  so  long as  they are  "reasonable."  This principle  is  quite jarring  to
those who  recall  the suggestion,  found in Marbury v.  Madison 13  and re-
peated  time and  again  in American public law,  that it is for judges,  and
no one  else, to  "say  what  the law  is."1 4  But it is also  strikingly reminis-
cent  of the  New  Deal  enthusiasm  for  agency  autonomy  and  the  New
Deal  belief in  a  sharp  disjunction  between  the  realm  of law  and  the
realm  of administration. 15  In  view  of the  breadth  and  importance  of
the  decision,  it  should  be  unsurprising  that  the  case  has  been  cited

9.  See generallyJ.  RabkinJudicial  Compulsions  (1989)  (arguing that courts  should
limit  intervention  in  agency  process  to  protection  of  individual  rights  to  liberty  and
property,  rather  than considering  policy arguments  of various  interest groups).  An  ex-
ception isJ. Mashaw  & D. Harfst, The Struggle for Auto Safety (1990),  which argues  that
legal  checks  have slowed  down desirable  regulation;  see also  Strauss, Considering Polit-
ical Alternatives  to "Hard Look"  Review,  1989 Duke LJ. 538,  544  (arguing against judi-
cial  "hard  look"  because  of availability  of political  safeguards).

It is  not  surprising  that  many commentators  with  little sympathy  for regulation  re-
cently have  adopted  the  view  that  law  and  administration  are  incompatible.  Since  the
1980s,  the  Republican  party,  enthusiastic  for deregulation,  has  occupied  the  executive
branch  and  thus  dominated  federal  agencies.  The  majority in  Congress  generally  has
been  Democratic  and  more  receptive  to  social  and  economic  regulation.  Part  of the
debate  over  Chevron undoubtedly  turns on  competing  views  about regulation,  and  the
outcome of that debate  will  have consequences  for the  scope of regulatory intervention.
The  reach of Chevron should depend,  however,  on broader  institutional  considerations,
not on  political alliances,  which  may  be short-term.

more than  1000 times  since its publication  in  1984.16  Chevron promises
to  be  a pillar in  administrative  law  for  many  years  to  come.  It has  be-
come  a  kind  of Marbury,  or  counter-Marbury,  for  the  administrative
state.

Perhaps  more  importantly,  the  decision  has  established  itself  as
one  of the very  few defining  cases  in  the last  twenty  years of American
public  law.  Chevron  defines  a  cluster  of ideas  about  who  is  entrusted
with  interpreting  ambiguous  statutes  and,  less  obviously,  about  what
legal  interpretation  actually  is. t7  In  its  allocation  of governmental  au-
thority and  in its production  of outcomes  in  the real world, the impor-
tance  of  the  case  far  exceeds  that  of  the  Supreme  Court's  more
celebrated  constitutional rulings  on the subject of separation of powers
in  the  1980s,  probably  even  if all  of these  are  taken  together.1 8  In  an
extraordinarily  wide range of areas-including  the environment, 19 wel-
fare  benefits, 20  labor  relations, 2'  civil  rights, 2 2  energy, 2 3  food  and
drugs,2 4 banking,2 5 and many  others-Chevron  has  altered  the distribu-
tion  of national  powers  among  courts,  Congress,  and  administrative
agencies.

To  say  this  is  not  to  say  that  Chevron  is  self-applying.  As  is  usual
with  important  rulings,  the  case  raises  at least  as  many  questions  as  it
answers.  The  Court's  reasoning  has  been subject  to  sharp  criticism, 2 6

under  the  Chevron  rubric.  See  Breyer,  supra  note  8,  at  373;  Byse, Judicial  Review  of

and  it  would  not  be  altogether  surprising  to  see  departures  from  a
broad  interpretation  of Chevron.  Indeed,  the  decision's  own  author,
Justice  Stevens,  has  suggested  a  relatively  narrow  reading. 2 7  Perhaps
the  principle  of deference  will  apply  only when  the  agency  is  carrying
out  delegated  lawmaking  authority. 28  Perhaps  the  principle  applies
only  to cases calling  for the agency's  specialized  fact-finding and policy-
making  competence,  most  notably  those  involving  applications  of law
to  fact,  rather  than  pure questions  of law.2 9  Perhaps  an agency's  views
about its  own jurisdiction will  have little or no weight,  or perhaps,  more
generally,  an agency view will not warrant  deference when  its  self-inter-
est  is  conspicuously  at stake.3 0

In  this  Article,  I  examine  a range  of questions  about  the  rationale
and  reach  of Chevron.  My  most  general  goal  is  to  give  the  decision  its
appropriate  place  in  mediating  the  relationship  between  law  and  ad-
ministration.  To  carry  out  that  task,  it  will  be  necessary  to  explore
quite  general  questions  about  the  relationship  between  the  original
constitutional  structure  and  modern  regulatory  government.

The Article is organized  into three parts.  In Part I, I describe  some
of the initial  conflicts  between  law  and  administration  and  examine  the
role  of  Chevron  in  reconciling  these  conflicts.  In  Part  II,  I  explore
Chevron's  reach,  treating  the  case  as  if it  set  forth  the  only  applicable
interpretive  principle  and  discussing  the  limitations  of  that  principle.
My  principal  claim  here  is  that  Chevron is  best  defended  as  a  sensible
reconstruction  of congressional  instructions  in light  of the  relevant  in-
stitutional  capacities,  and  that  this  understanding  requires  certain  limi-
tations  on  the  Chevron principle  as  much  as  a  general  endorsement  of
the  principle  itself.  Most  important,  I  argue  that  because  Chevron  ap-
plies  only in  cases  of congressional  delegation  of law-making authority,

agency  interpretations  in a  number of contexts  are  not entitled  to  def-
erence  at  all.

In  Part  III,  I  deal  with  a  problem  that  has  only  begun  to  be  ad-
dressed  in  the courts.  That question involves  the relationship  between
the Chevron principle  and other prevailing norms  or principles  of statu-
tory  construction.3 1  What  is  a  court  to  do  when  an  administrative
agency  interprets  an  ambiguous  statute  in  a  way  that  conflicts  with an
established  interpretive principle?3 2  The question is of both considera-
ble  theoretical  interest  and  immense  practical  importance.  If Chevron
allows  agency  interpretations  to  defeat  well-established  interpretive
principles,  it will  indeed have  worked  a revolution  in  the law.

In  Part  III,  I  contend  that  many  interpretive  principles  serve  an
important  separation  of powers  function  by requiring  legislative  rather
than  merely  administrative  deliberation  on  certain  questions.  For  this
reason,  the Chevron principle  ought  not to  be  understood  to  overcome
all  otherwise  applicable  interpretive  norms,  though  some  of  these
norms  are  in  fact defeated  by  Chevron.

A  more  general  conclusion  follows  from  these  suggestions.  In
many  of its  applications,  Chevron  is  a  salutary  recognition  of a  large-
scale  shift in the allocation  of authority  within American institutions.  It
embodies,  in  those applications,  a plausible  reconstruction  of congres-
sional  desires  and  a  sound  understanding  of the  comparative  advan-
tages  of agencies  in administering  complex  statutes.  At  the same  time,
Chevron is  in tension with deeply engrained  ideas,  traceable to  the earli-
est  days  of the American republic,  to  the  effect that  those who  are  lim-
ited  by  law  ought  not  to  be  entrusted  with  the  power  to  define  the
limitation.  But  if  other  interpretive  norms  counter  the  Chevron  ap-
proach  in  contexts  in  which  the  risks  are  especially  serious,  it  may  be
possible  to  reconcile  that  approach  with  principles  of  separation  of
powers and statutory  construction that are both time-honored  and enti-
tled  to  current respect.  An  effort  to  explain  the relationship  between
Chevron and  other interpretive  principles  is therefore part of the contin-
uing  and  far  larger  enterprise  of sorting  out the relationship  between
the  original  constitutional  framework  and  traditional  legal  constraints

31.  For a  discussion of particular principles,  see infra notes  160-174  and accompa-
nying text.  For general  discussion,  see Eskridge,  Public Values in Statutory  Interpreta-

Indeed,  it is  mistaken  to  suggest  that language  and  history  exist  independent  of inter-
pretive principles.  The very notion  of statutory text cannot  make sense without simulta-
neous reference  to principles  of statutory construction.  See  infra  note  159.

on the one hand, and, on the other, a regulatory state  that was  intended
in  large  part  to  displace  them.

I.  COURTS,  ADMINISTRATION,  AND  THE  NEW  DEAL

In this  Part, I undertake  two  tasks.  First, I outline the origins  of the
perceived  tension  between  law  and  administration,  and  I  explore  vari-
ous  efforts  by  courts  to  mediate  that  tension  in  the  wake  of the  New
Deal.  Second,  I discuss  the origins and setting of the Chevron principle,
attempting  to defend  that principle by reference  to certain  understand-
ings  about  both  the  administrative  state  and  the  nature  of statutory
interpretation.

A.  Historical Notes

Before  the rise  of the regulatory  state,  the allocation  of authority
between  the executive  branch  and  the judiciary  was  relatively  clear:  it
was  for the courts,  not the executive,  to  "say  what the law  is,"'3 3 at least
in  litigated  cases.  This  understanding  extended  to  interpretation  of
statutes  no  less than  to  interpretation  of the Constitution.3 4  Most  stat-
utory  disputes  did  not  involve  the  executive  branch  as  a  party.  Since
government  almost always acted without the mediation  of a policy-mak-
ing,  fact-finding  administrative  agency,  it  was  only  natural  that  ques-
tions  of statutory meaning  would  be  decided  by the courts.  And when
the executive  branch was a party, it was  treated  like  any other litigant in
the  sense  that  its own  views  would  not  be  entitled  to  special  weight. 35
The judicial  power  of interpretation  existed  even  when  the task  of
resolving ambiguities  depended  not only on statutory language and his-
tory,  but  also  on  assessments  of what  sort  of approach  would  produce
rationality  or justice in  federal  law.  When traditional  sources  of inter-
pretation  left  doubt, ambiguities  were  sometimes  resolved  by precisely
these  assessments.3 6  To be  sure, assessments  of this sort  called for ju-
dicial inquiries  into  both policy and principle.  But these  inquiries  were
not especially  troublesome,  for judge-made  regulatory  principles-em-
bodied  in the common  law  of torts,  contracts,  and  property-had been
woven into  the fabric  of American  public and  private law  from  the  out-

set.  Statutory  interpretation  that  involved a  measure  of policy-making
discretion  existed  comfortably  in  a  legal  order  in  which  policy  fre-
quently had  been determined  by  the judges.3 7

All this  was  changed  by  the  creation  in  the twentieth  century  of a
massive  administrative  apparatus,  which was  of course  a self-conscious
repudiation  of regulation  through  the judiciary.  For the twentieth  cen-
tury reformers,  courts lacked  the flexibility, powers of coordination,  ini-
tiative,  democratic  accountability,  and  expertise  necessary  to  deal  with
complex  social  problems.3 8  The  administrative  framework  resulting
from  these  reform  efforts  disrupted  every  essential  element  of Ameri-
can  constitutionalism,  including  its  three  cornerstones:  The  original
conception  of individual rights,  the system of checks  and balances,  and
federalism.3 9

Perhaps  the  most  fundamental  point  is  that  the  new  framework
called  into  question  the  original  understanding  that  individual  rights
lay  principally  in  immunity  from  governmental  constraints.40  For  the
New  Dealers,  individual  rights were  in fact a product of legal  decisions;
they  were  hardly  prepolitical  or  even  "negative."  Having  rejected  the
view  that  the  common  law  system  was  part  of the state  of nature,  the
New Deal reformers  saw  government action as  a necessary guarantor  of
economic  productivity,  distributive  equity,  and  even  rights,  properly

37.  Because  basic policy  often  had  been a creature  of the  common  law,  subject  to
only intermittent statutory interference,  it is misleading  to suggest, as  some do, see, e.g.,
J. Rabkin, supra note 9, at 6-18, that the period ofjudicial  lawmaking is a creature  of the
late  twentieth  century.  Of course  the use of the Constitution  as  a source  ofjudge-made
law raises  quite  different  questions  from the  use of the common  law,  especially because
the  former  is  much  more  difficult  to correct  through  the political  process.

See  S.  Skowronek,  supra  note 38,  at  165-211,  248-84.  But  it  was  the  New  Deal  that

understood.  In these  circumstances,  the common  law  catalogue  of pri-
vate rights  was  inadequate  because it included  both  too much  and  too
little-too much in the way of protection  of rights of property and mar-
ket  ordering;  too  little because it  excluded rights  of economic  security
deemed  indispensable  in  the wake  of the Depression.

Institutional  lessons  followed  from  these  substantive  claims.  Tra-
ditionally  separated  powers  and  the  system  of  checks  and  balances
seemed  an  obstacle  to  the  enactment  and  implementation  of protec-
tions  at  the  national  level.  New  governmental  bodies-  combining
powers  and  not  subject  to  the  constraints  of checks  and  balances-
were  necessary  to  carry out the agenda  of the New  Deal.  Far from  be-
ing  a valuable  safeguard  against national  tyranny,  federalism  appeared
to  be  a  faction-driven  obstacle  to  necessary  social  change.  So  too,
traditional  legal  constraints  on  administration  seemed  to  defeat  the
goal  of providing  new  entities  with  unique  self-starting  capacities,  a
high  degree  of democratic  accountability,  and,  not incidentally,  enthu-
siasm  for the new  regulatory  missions  set for  the national  government
by  Congress  and  the President.

It  was  inevitable  that  this  set  of claims-the  continuing  source  of
most  major  debates  in  American  public  law-would  ultimately  draw
into  question the idea  that interpretation  of regulatory  statutes  was  for
the judiciary  alone.  Indeed, during  the constitutional  and  nonconstitu-
tionaljudicial  assault  on administration,  independent judicial  interpre-
tation  of law  was  seen  as  a  constitutional  requirement  under  article
111.41  Judicial review was  thought to serve identifiable  substantive  goals
as  well.  Invoking  the principle  that  statutes  in  derogation  of the  com-
mon law  should  be  narrowly construed, 42  and  insisting  that interpreta-
tion  of  law  was  for  judges,  courts  often  sharply  circumscribed
administrative power by drawing  on principles  of private autonomy and
free  markets  that regulation  was  intended  to  displace.43

The idea  that  courts,  and  not administrators,  were  responsible  for
discerning  the meaning  of statutes  seemed  to  win  legislative  endorse-
ment  through  the enactment  of the APA  in  1946. 44  That  statute was  a
compromise  between  New  Dealers  enthusiastic  about  administrative
power  and  conservative  critics who  saw  this power  as a veil  for tyranny,
particularly  in  the context of labor relations.4 5  Despite  its ambivalence
on the question  of agency  autonomy,  the APA  appeared  to endorse ju-

dicial  control of administration  and to  direct courts  to interpret  statutes
on  their own.  Thus  the APA  states:  "To  the extent  necessary  to  deci-
sion  and  when  presented,  the  reviewing court shall decide all relevant ques-
tions of law, [and] interpret constitutional and statutory provisions .... ,,46
Nevertheless,  in  the aftermath  of the  constitutional  assault  on  ad-
ministration,  courts  sometimes  said that agencies were  entitled  to inter-
pret  the  statutes  that  they  administer,  and  that  courts  would  defer  as
long  as  agency  interpretations  were  reasonable. 4 7  This  idea  repre-

Procedure  Act:  The Beginnings,  72  Va. L.  Rev. 219  (1986)  (recounting APA's  creation
and  passage  and  arguing  that vituperation  gave  way  to  calm reasoning).

46.  5  U.S.C.  § 706  (1988)  (emphasis  added).  Of course,  it is  possible  that courts
sometimes  should resolve the relevant  question of law by holding that statutory ambigu-
ities  are  to  be  resolved  by  the agency.  On  that  view,  part  of  the  answer  to  the  legal
question is  that ambiguities  are  for agency resolution.  But when  Congress  has not spe-
cifically  conferred  that power on  the agency  through  the organic  statute,  that argument
seems  weak.

The legislative  history  emphasizes  the  need  for judicial  constraints  on  administra-
tion.  See,  e.g., Legislative  History, Administrative  Procedure Act, S.  Doc. No.  248,  79th
Cong.,  2d  Sess.  305  (1946)  (remarks  of  Sen.  McCarran,  Chairman,  House  Judiciary
Comm.)  ("I  desire  to  emphasize  the  . . .provisions  for judicial  review,  because  it  is
something  in  which  the  American  public  has  been  and  is  much  concerned,  harkening
back,  if we  may,  to  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States,  which  sets  up  the judicial
branch  of the Government  for the redress  of human  wrongs"); id. at 217  (Report of the
Senate Judiciary  Comm.)  ("the enforcement  of the  bill, by  the  independent judicial  in-
terpretation  and  application  of its  terms,  is  a function  which  is  clearly  conferred  upon
the  courts....  Judicial review  is of utmost importance ....  It is  indispensable  since  its
mere existence generally precludes  the arbitrary exercise  of powers  not granted");  id. at
251,311-12, 382-85.

The influential Attorney  General's  Committee  on Administrative  Procedure was un-

certain  on  the  point:

The question  of statutory  interpretation might  be approached  by  the  court  de
novo  and  given  the  answer  which  the  court  thinks  to be  the  "right interpreta-
tion."  Or the court might approach  it, somewhat as a question  of fact,  to ascer-
tain,  not  the  "right  interpretation,"  but  only  whether  the  administrative
interpretation  has  substantial support ....  Thus,  where  the statute  is  reason-
ably  susceptible  of more  than  one  interpretation,  the  court may  accept  that  of
the administrative  body....  This may be particularly  significant when  the legis-
lation  deals  with  complex  matters  calling  for expert knowledge  and judgment.
Final  Report of the Attorney  General's Comm.  on Administrative  Procedure,  in Admin-
istrative  Procedure in Government  Agencies,  S.  Doc. No. 8,  77th Cong.,  1st Sess. 90-91
(1941).  Note,  however,  that  the  Attorney  General's  Committee  is  entitled  to  far  less
weight than the text of the APA  and even its history in Congress, both of which argue for
independent  review.  Moreover,  the  Committee  may  well  have  been  biased  against  in-
dependent judicial  review  because  it  was  allied  with  the  institutional  interests  of  the
executive  branch,  and because  it consisted  in large part of New  Deal  enthusiasts  skepti-
cal  about judicial  checks  on administration.

The useful treatment  in Scalia, Judicial Deference  to Administrative  Interpretations
of Law,  1989  Duke L.J.  511,  512-14, properly  draws attention  to this passage  from  the
Attorney General's  Committee's  report.  But it overstates  the  extent to which  deference
to administrative  interpretations  was contemplated  by  the  APA  as  evidenced by  its  text
and  underlying  purposes,  both  of which  argue in favor  of independent  review.

sented  a  firm  endorsement  of the  allied  principles,  prominent  during
the New  Deal, of administrative autonomy  and  limited judicial interfer-
ence  with  the  process  of regulation.  It  also  recognized  that  the  very
arguments  that  called  for  the  rise  of regulatory  entities  raised  sharp
questions  about  whether  judicial  interpretation  of  regulatory  law
should  continue  to  be  independent.  Marbury,  in  short,  no  longer
seemed  well  adapted  to  American  public law.  At  the  same  time,  many
courts  continued  to  insist  that  the  interpretation  of statutes  was  first
and  foremost a judicial  task.48

It  is  ironic  but  true  that  this  insistence  became  particularly  pro-
nounced  in  the  1960s  and  1970s,  a  period in  which  those  enthusiastic
about  regulation were  especially  dissatisfied  with administrative  auton-
omy.  In this period, agencies  appeared unenthusiastic  about their man-
dates.  The  phenomenon  of "capture"  received  widespread  attention,
and judicial  controls  seemed  to  be  an  important  part  of the project  of
ensuring  that regulatory  statutes,  especially  in  the environmental  area,
would  produce  change  in  the  real world.49  In  a  surprising  reversal  of
New  Deal alliances,  those who  were  critical of the effects  of regulation
in  the  1980s were  frequently  insistent on  administrative  autonomy  and
the  perverse  effects  of legalism 5 0-whereas 
critics  seeking  to  bring
about  greater  regulatory  protections  saw  administrative  independence
and  autonomy  as  the problem  rather  than  the solution.5 1  The  rule  of
law, including firm judicial constraints  on the bureaucracy,  was  a mech-
anism  for ensuring  that agencies  would  carry  out the will  of Congress.
Before  1984,  the law  thus reflected  a puzzling and relatively  ad hoc
set of doctrines  about when courts should  defer to  administrative inter-
pretations  of law.  All  this  was  changed  by  Chevron.

In  Chevron,  the  Supreme  Court  confronted  an  important  decision
by  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  ("EPA")  under the Clean  Air
Act. 52  The  case  involved  permit  programs  in  "nonattainment"  states,
that  is,  states  that  have  not  met  federal  ambient  air  quality  require-
ments.  These  states  are  required  to  establish  a  permit  program  for
"new  or modified major  stationary  sources"  of air pollution. 5 3  No new
or  modified  source  may  receive  a  permit  unless  it  meets  stringent
requirements.

54

Before  the  1980s,  the EPA had  treated as a "source"  any pollution-
emitting device  in  a plant.5 5  If  a  plant had  ten of these  devices,  it had
to  apply  for  a  permit  to  modify  any  of them  or  to  add  a  new  one.  In
1981,  however,  the  EPA  decided  that  it would  not require  a  permit  if
the modification  of an existing device or the installation  of a new device
did  not  increase  total  emissions  from  the  plant. 56  In  other  words,  the
plant,  and  not  each  emitting  entity  within  it,  would  be  treated  as  a
"source."  This  plantwide  definition  of source  enabled  a  company  to
add  or  modify  pollution-emitting  devices  as  long  as  it  reduced  emis-
sions  from  another part  of the  same  plant, producing  no aggregate  in-
crease  in  emissions.  The  question  for decision  in  Chevron was  whether
the  plantwide  definition  of "source"  violated  the  Clean  Air  Act. 57

The  court  of appeals  held  that  it  did.58  For  the  lower  court,  the
purpose  of the nonattainment  program  was  to  bring  about  rapid  state
compliance  with  federal  air  quality  requirements,  and  the  plantwide
definition  of  source  was  inconsistent  with  that  overriding  goal.  The
court  was  unable  to  point  to  a  particular  provision  that  barred  the
EPA's  plantwide  definition,  but it said  that that definition  was  inconsis-
tent  with  the  general  purposes  of the  nonattainment  program. 59

The  Supreme  Court  disagreed.6 0  Rebuking  the  court  of appeals
for  usurping  the  agency's  policy-making  authority,  the  Court  said  that
nothing in the  statute or its history spoke to  the issue whether the plant
or each emitting  device  within it amounted to a  "source."  The  general
purposes  of the  nonattainment  program,  embodying  an  effort  to  pro-
mote  environmental  quality  with  minimal  restrictions  on  economic
growth, were  simply too broad to bear on that issue.  Because  Congress
had  not "directly  spoken  to the precise question  at issue,"  the question

[Vol.  90:2071

was  "whether  the  agency's  answer  is  based  on  a permissible  construc-
tion  of the statute." 6 1  For the  Court,  "considerable  weight should  be
accorded  to  an  executive  department's  construction  of  a  statutory
scheme  it is  entrusted  to administer."' 62  The  Court thus  created  a  two-
step  inquiry.  The  first  question  was  whether  Congress  had  explicitly
foreclosed  the  agency's  decision.  The  second  was  whether  that  deci-
sion  was  reasonable  or  permissible.

All  this was  sufficient  to dispose  of the specific  problem  in Chevron.
Congress  had  not  decided  against  a  plantwide  definition  of  source.
Moreover,  the  agency's  decision  was  an  exceedingly  reasonable  means
of accommodating  the economic  and  environmental  goals  that under-
lay  the Clean  Air  Act.  Indeed,  the plantwide  definition  achieved  eco-
nomic  savings  without jeopardizing  environmental  degradation,  and
may  even  have  helped  to  diminish  it.63

In  addition,  a  principle  of deference  was  appropriate  in  Chevron.
The  agency's  fact-finding  and  policy-making  competence,  and  its  elec-
toral  accountability,  were  highly  relevant  to the  issue of how  "source"
should  be defined.  In Chevron itself, the Court quite rightly implied  that
any principle  of deference  is a product of Congress's  explicit or implicit
instructions  on that question.  The  central point is  this:  Courts must defer
to  agency  interpretations if  and when  Congress has  told them  to  do  so. 64  And
when  agency  competence  is  relevant,  deference  is  particularly  appro-
priate,  since it is  the most plausible instruction  to attribute  to Congress
if the legislature  has  issued no  clear  statement  on the point-a  subject
to  which  I  return  below. 6 5

Since  Chevron  itself,  the  general  principle  of deference  has  been
invoked  on  numerous  occasions  and  produced  considerable  contro-
versy.  In INS v.  Cardoza-Fonseca,6 6  the Supreme  Court appeared  to  say
that Chevron would  apply only in cases  involving mixed  questions of law
and  fact,  rather than  pure  questions  of law:  courts  would  decide  pure
questions  of law  on  their  own.  In  a  concurring  opinion, Justice  Scalia
vigorously  rejected  this  suggestion, 67  and the Court has failed  to take it

the  statute is  (by  hypothesis)  permissible,  the  delegation  of power  to  give  meaning  to
statutory  terms  should  be seen  as a legitimate  part of the  authority  of implementation.

in the short  run, increase  the power  of the Republican  branch-one  that is far less  hos-

up in subsequent cases.  In other cases  the Supreme Court has held  that
at least  arguably ambiguous  statutes  admitted  of only  a single interpre-
tation,  sometimes  producing  sharp  dissenting  opinions  that  invoked
Chevron.6 8  Most  strikingly,  the  Supreme  Court  has  rejected  a  number
of agency interpretations  of law  even  in  the  aftermath  of Chevron.69

C.  Chevron's  Rationale

It  is  not  my  purpose  here  to  say  whether  or  not  the  analysis  in
Chevron  was  correct.70  The  nature  and  reach  of the  case  can  best  be
ascertained,  however,  by  considering  what  might  be  said  in  its favor.

Before  the discretionary,  policy-making  administrative  agency  be-
came  pervasive,  the notion  that  courts  would  interpret the law,  includ-
ing  federal  statutes,  seemed  axiomatic.  In  the  twentieth  century,
however,  Congress  frequently  has  delegated  basic  implementing  au-
thority  to regulatory  agencies,  and  the allocation  of interpretive  power
has become  far more complex.  Any principles  of deference  to  adminis-
trators  must of course depend  on congressional  instructions,  at least as
a  general  rule.

When  Congress  has  expressly  said  that  deference  is  or  is  not  ap-

pitable  to regulatory  controls  than  Congress.  This fact is probably  not irrelevant  to the
debate  over  Chevron.  See  supra  note 9.

propriate,  the matter  is  relatively  simple. 7'  As  stated  above,  the  text
and background  of the APA  suggest a firm belief in the need for judicial
checks  on administration,  particularly with respect  to  the interpretation
of law. 7 2  The view that courts  should always  defer to agency interpreta-
tions is,  therefore,  a poor reconstruction  of the instructions  of the APA.
It  remains  possible,  however,  that  particular  substantive  statutes  dis-
place  the APA  and  accord law-interpreting  power  to  the  agency.  If so,
the courts  should  defer  in  such  cases  on  the  ground  that  the  relevant
law  is  what  the  agency  says  that  it  is.  The  APA's  provision  for  in-
dependent judicial  interpretation  of law  is  not inconsistent,  then,  with
Chevron's  deference  to  the  agency's  interpretation  if  Congress  has,
under  particular  statutes,  granted  the relevant  authority  to  administra-
tive agencies.

Frequently,  however,  Congress  does not speak in  explicit terms  on
the question  of deference.  When  this is  so,  the  court's  task is  to  make
the best reconstruction  that it can  of congressional  instructions. 73  And
if Congress  has  not  made  a  clear  decision  one  way  or  the  other,  the
choice among  the alternatives  will  call for an assessment  of which  strat-
egy is the most sensible  one to attribute  to Congress  under the  circum-
stances.  This  assessment is  not a mechanical  exercise  of uncovering  an
actual  legislative  decision.  It  calls  for  a  frankly  value-laden judgment
about  comparative  competence,  undertaken  in  light  of the  regulatory
structure  and  applicable  constitutional  considerations.

If all this is so, the Chevron approach  might well  be defended  on the
ground  that  the  resolution  of ambiguities  in  statutes  is  sometimes  a
question of policy as much as it is one  of law, narrowly  understood,  and
that agencies  are  uniquely  well situated to make  the relevant  policy de-
cisions.  In  some  cases,  there  is  simply  no  answer  to  the  interpretive
question if it is posed as an inquiry into  some real  or unitary instruction
of the legislature.  Sometimes  congressional  views  cannot  plausibly  be
aggregated  in  a  way  that  reflects  a  clear  resolution  of  regulatory
problems,  many of them  barely  foreseen  or indeed  unforeseeable.7 4  In
these  circumstances,  legal  competence,  as  narrowly  understood,  is  in-
sufficient for  decision.  The  resolution  of the ambiguity  calls  for an  in-
quiry  into  something  other  than  the  instructions  of  the  enacting
legislature.  And  in  examining  those  other  considerations,  the institu-
tion  entrusted with the decision  must make reference  to considerations

of both fact  and  policy.75

Chevron nicely illustrates  the point.  The decision  about whether to
adopt a plantwide  definition  of "source"  required distinctly administra-
tive  competence  because  it called  for  a  complex  inquiry,  not foreseen
by  Congress,  into  the  environmental  and  economic  consequences  of
the various  possibilities.  If regulatory  decisions  in  the face  of ambigui-
ties  amount in large part to choices  of policy, and if Congress  has dele-
gated basic implementing authority  to the agency, the Chevron approach
might reflect  a belief, attributable  to Congress  in the absence  of a clear
contrary  legislative  statement,  in  the  comparative  advantages  of  the
agency  in  making  those  choices.

All this  suggests  that  Chevron reflects  not merely  a  particular  view
about who  ought to interpret ambiguous  statutes, but also, and perhaps
more  interestingly,  a  distinctive  theory  of interpretation.  In  the  last
generation  it has  frequently  been  suggested  that  the process  of inter-
pretation  is  often not  merely a mechanical  reconstruction  of legislative
desires. 76 
Instead  that  process  sometimes  calls  for  an  inquiry  into
questions  of both policy  and principle.  Thus, for  example, it has  been
said  that statutory  ambiguities  should  or must be sorted  out on the ba-
sis  of an assessment  of which interpretation is "reasonable," 7 7 or makes
the  statute  "the  best piece  of statesmanship  it  can  be, ' 7 8  or  takes  ac-
count  of appropriate  background  norms dealing with the functions  and
failures  of the regulatory  state. 79

At  least  as  a  general  rule,  these  suggestions  argue  powerfully  in
favor  of administrative  rather than judicial  resolution  of hard  statutory
questions.  The  fact-finding  capacity  and electoral  accountability  of the
administrators  are  far  greater  than  those  of courts.8 0  Chevron  is  best

75.  The  question about  whether  deference  is  due  to  an  administrative  interpreta-
tion  of law  itself is  an  example.  Congress  has  not explicitly  resolved  that question,  and
so it must be answered  on the basis of an attempted reconstruction  invoking extratextual
considerations.

76.  See infra  notes 77-79.  In an  important respect  that process  is never  mechani-
cal,  since  it always depends  on background norms.  Even the easiest  cases are decided by
reference  to norms  and practices  that are in fact  present, but are  so widely  shared  as  to
seem  invisible.  A denial  that interpretive  norms are  at work should  be taken  as  a reflec-
tion  of interpretive  unself-consciousness.  Usually,  of course,  the  norms  are  supported
by a sufficiently broad  consensus  to make interpretation relatively simple-which, again,
is  not  to  say mechanical.

policy,  but  rather  "to  find  the best justification  ...  of a  past  legislative  event."  Id.  at

understood  and  defended  as  a  frank recognition  that  sometimes  inter-
pretation  is  not simply  a  matter of uncovering  legislative  will,  but also
involves  extratextual  considerations  of various  kinds,  including judg-
ments  about  how  a  statute  is  best  or  most  sensibly  implemented.
Chevron reflects a  salutary understanding  that these judgments  of policy
and  principle  should  be  made  by  administrators  rather  than judges.8 1
The point can  be made  more vivid by examining  some of the char-
acteristic  problems  in  modem  regulation. 82  Often  the regulatory  pro-
cess  is  confounded  by  the  difficulty  of coordinating  numerous  statutes
with  one  another.  For example,  the problems  of air  and  water  pollu-
tion  are  closely  entangled.  Efforts  to  control  the  one  may  aggravate
the  other,  and  there  are  complex  interactions  among  various  cleanup
strategies.  If the  problems  are  treated  separately,  they  will  not  be
treated  well.  The  EPA  is  charged  with  implementing  numerous  stat-
utes,  and  it is  in  a  far  better  position  than  the judiciary,  reacting  as  it
must  to  single  cases,  to  respond  to  difficulties  of this  sort.83

Sometimes  regulation is  made  more difficult because  of the perva-
sive  problem  of changed  circumstances.  New  developments  involving
technological  capacity,  economics,  the international  situation,  or  even
law  may  affect  regulatory  performance.  Congress  is  unable  to  amend
every  statute  to  account  for  these  changes,  a  situation  that  creates  a
genuine  problem  for  those  who  must  apply  the  statute.  Here  as  well,
administrators  are  in a  far  better position  than  courts  to  interpret  am-
biguous  statutes in a way  that  takes account  of new conditions.8 4  Or to
put  the  point  slightly  differently:  Because  of its  focus  on  individual
cases,  and  because  decisions  are made  after the dispute  has  arisen,  the
common  law  process  has  a  significant  advantage  over legislation  in  its
capacity  to  respond  to changing  conditions  and  mores.  The  shift from
the  common  law  to  legislation,  embodied  in  the  New  Deal,  therefore
gave  rise to  a serious  risk of obsolescence,  one  that is  often  realized  in
practice. 8 5  In  these  circumstances,  a  grant  of interpretive  authority  to

(1982)  (suggesting that  NLRB's  policies  may  be  closely  tied  to  those  of the  administra-
tion).  Moreover,  shifts  in  the judiciary  are  a  predictable  consequence  of shifts  in  the
administration,  and  in  this  sense  courts  are  not  wholly  independent.  Finally,  agencies
are  sometimes  subject  to narrow  or parochial  pressures.  Their decisions  can  hardly  be
said  to  track  the  public  will  in  all  cases.  These  qualifications  do  not,  however,  under-
mine  the  basic  claim  that  the  democratic  pedigree  of the  agency  is  usually  superior  to
that  of the court.

administrators,  allowing  them  to  take changed  circumstances  into  con-
sideration,  seems  to  be  a  valuable  if partial  corrective.8 6  The  result is
to  confer a  power  of adaptation  on institutions  that  combine  the judi-
cial  virtue  of continuing  attention  to  individual  contexts  and  new  set-
tings  with 
the  legislative  virtue  of  a  fair  degree  of  electoral
accountability.

Sometimes  regulation  fails because  of the excessive  rigidity  of stat-
utory  commands.8 7  In  light  of the  wide  variety  of contexts  to  which
statutes  must  be  applied,  a  degree  of flexibility  in  implementation  is
quite healthy.  Congress  cannot  possibly foresee  all of the problems  to
be  dealt with under broad  statutory terms.8 8  Statutory terms  may offer
ambiguous  guidance to agencies  that must establish  regulations in com-
plex areas.8 9  Such agencies are in a much better position than  courts  to

approach  are  to be treated as  precedents.  See also  G.  Gilmore, The  Ages  of American
Law 95-98  (1977)  (arguing forjudicial  overruling  of outdated  statutes).  But a system  in
which  administrators  respond  to  changed  conditions  through  statutory  construction
seems  far  preferable.  Administrators  have  a  better  democratic  pedigree  and  more
knowledge  with  which  to  undertake  this  task.  Moreover,  changed  circumstances  often
produce  ambiguities  that agencies  are in  a uniquely  good position  to resolve.  See  Sun-
stein,  supra  note  26,  at 493-97.

86.  See  infra notes  141-150  and  accompanying  text  (arguing that  deference  is ap-
propriate  when  agency modifies or reverses prior interpretations);  Scalia,  supra note 46,

87.  A  prominent  example  is  the  "best  available  technology"  strategy  in  environ-
mental  statutes,  which  requires  all  firms  to  adopt  the  same  technology.  A  far  better
strategy would  allow for greater  flexibility, allowing nontechnological  means  of reducing
pollution-when  that  approach  is  effective  and  cheap-and  permitting  diversity  in dif-
ferent parts  of the  country.  See  Ackerman  & Stewart,  Reforming  Environmental  Law:
The Democratic  Case  for Market  Incentives,  13  Colum.J.  Envtl.  L.  171,  178-88  (1988).

Kagan,  Going  by  the  Book:  The  Problem  of  Regulatory  Unreasonableness  309-10
(1982)  ("A busy  and politically  divided  legislature  has  generally found it difficult  to en-
act  specific  standards  or to  engage  in detailed  supervision  or review  of specific regula-
tory agency  actions.").

89.  An  example is  provided by an important  recent case in which  a court relied on a
form  of literalism to defeat a fully sensible  administrative  initiative.  In American  Mining
Congress  v.  EPA,  824  F.2d  1177,  1180  (D.C.  Cir.  1987),  the EPA  issued regulations  to
deal  with  the  problem  of disposal  of material  held  for recycling.  The  EPA  decided  to
control,  as  solid  wastes,  "secondary  materials"  (spent  materials,  sludges,  byproducts,
commercial  chemical  products,  and  scrap metals)  unless these  materials  (a) are  directly
reused  as an  ingredient  or as an effective  substitute for a commercial  product, or (b) are
reused  as  a raw  material  substitute in  the  original  manufacturing  process.  This  defini-
tion meant that material burned  for energy recovery or that is reclaimed  or accumulated
speculatively would  be subject  to  government regulation  as "solid  waste."

The  court  of appeals  rejected  the  definition.  According to  the  court, the  statutory
definition  of waste as "any  garbage, refuse, sludge  ...  and  other discarded material,"  42
U.S.C.  § 6903(27),  meant  that the  secondary  materials  were  not  subject  to EPA  regula-
tion.  824  F.2d  at  1179-85.  According  to  the  court,  "discarded"  means,  simply,  dis-
carded  as that  term is  understood  in the  dictionary,  and  materials  that would  flow  from
one production  process  to  another were  not  "discarded."  Id.

The problems  with this  analysis are  twofold.  First, the  statutory definition  of waste
was not written  with attention  to the  particular problems of materials  held for recycling.

deal  with  these  sorts  of problems.

Perhaps  most  important,  regulation  often  runs  into  difficulty  be-
cause of the complex systemic  effects  of regulatory controls. 90  Statutes
interact  in  surprising  ways  with  markets,  other  statutes,  and  other
problems.  Unanticipated  consequences  are  common.  For  example,
regulation of new risks may exacerbate  old risks; severe  controls  on the
nuclear power industry  may increase  the need  for coal-fired  plants  and
thus  aggravate  health risks and  other dangers from acid  rain; a require-
ment  that industry adopt  the best available  technology may well  retard
technological  development  in  pollution  control.  Agencies  are far  bet-
ter  situated  than  courts  to  understand  and  counter  these  effects.  A
principle of deference  might  also increase  Congress's  incentive  to pro-
vide  specific guidance  to  administrators  and simultaneously  reduce  the
amount  of regulatory  litigation,  its  attendant  costs,  and  the  potential
balkanization  of federal  law  in  a  highly decentralized  court system.9'

In light of these considerations,  the Chevron approach might  be un-
derstood  as  the  best  reconstruction  of legislative  instructions  on  the
question  of deference.  Of course  the notion  of reconstruction  should
not be taken  as  a mechanical  application of some actual  legislative deci-
sion;  as  we  have  seen,  Congress  has  rendered  no  general  decision
about what  institution  should  interpret  the  statutes  it enacts.9 2  In  the
absence  of a  clear  resolution,  however,  a principle  of deference  might
improve  the operation  of regulatory law  and at the same  time appropri-
ately  distribute  authority  between  courts  and  agencies.

To  be  sure,  such  a  reconstruction  would  not  track  legislative
desires  under  every  statute.  By itself, an  ambiguity  is  not a delegation
of law-interpreting  power,  and  it  would  be  a  major  error  to  treat  all
ambiguities  as  delegations.  In fact  many regulatory  statutes,  especially
in  the environmental  area,  were  passed  in periods  of considerable  sus-
picion  of agency  performance.  Congress  has  often  believed  that  the
pressures  imposed  on administrators  lead  them  to regulate with  insuffi-
cient  vigor.9 3  Congress's  fear of agency  bias  or even  abdication  makes

How  the term  "discarded"  should  be understood  in this  context  is  not a  question  that
realistically  can  be  resolved  by  reference  to  the  dictionary.  Second,  the  question
whether  these  materials  should  be  understood  as  "discarded"  and  thus  treated  as
"waste"  depended  on  a  range  of highly  complex  and  particular  inquiries  of  fact  and
policy.  It  is fully  plausible  that  much  of this  material  produced  the  same  risks  that  the
relevant  statute was  designed  to prevent-indeed  the  problem  of management  of re-
cycled  industrial  materials  creates "extremely  serious  hazards.  Here  the  court  should
have  deferred  to the  agency's  expert judgment  on  a  complex  problem  not  foreseen  by
Congress,  rather  than  using,  in  a mechanical  way,  a  statutory  term  that  is  ambiguous
with  regard to the particular problem.  Indeed, the  case was an  excellent one for applica-
tion  of Chevron on  grounds  of superior  administrative  competence.

it most doubtful  that the legislature  has  sought deference  to  the agency
under  all  circumstances.  But even  if the Chevron  principle  is  not accu-
rate in every case, it is perhaps as  accurate as any bright-line alternative,
and  it therefore has  the significant  virtue  of combining  a fair degree  of
accuracy  with a  reasonably  clear  rule.94

II.  CHEVRON'S  REACH

The considerations  marshalled thus  far may not be  decisive. Coun-
tervailing  considerations,  some of them  taken up below,  make it easy to
understand  the continuing  debate over the wisdom  of the Chevron prin-
ciple. 95  But  even  if it is  agreed  that  deference  was  appropriate  in  the
context of Chevron and that the basic principle  is sound, a large  number
of questions  remain.  Indeed, it is  in  the effort  to  sort  out the reach  of
Chevron that a significant  amount of the allocation  of authority between
courts  and  agencies,  and  among  courts,  agencies,  and  Congress,  will
occur.  I  attempt  in  this  section  to  describe  the  unresolved  questions
and to  suggest how  they might be treated.  I do not deal here with cases
of conflict  with other  interpretive  principles,  a  problem  treated  in  Part
III.  For present  purposes  I  assume  that  Chevron provides  the only  ap-
plicable  principle.

A quite  general  conclusion  emerges  from  the  discussion:  Chevron
is  inapplicable  when  the  particular  context  suggests  that  deference
would  be  a poor reconstruction  of congressional  desires.  The  clearest
case is  provided when the agency has  not been  accorded implementing
authority  at  all,  but  the  same  concern  arises  when  the  agency  is  for
some other reason  at a clear  comparative  disadvantage  to  courts.  This
latter category  includes  cases of likely bias  and, somewhat  more contro-
versially,  cases  involving  questions  of jurisdiction.

A. Just How Ambiguous?

Chevron does  not say how  ambiguous  a statute must be  in order for
the  agency  view  to  control.  If any  ambiguity  triggers  the  deference
rule-if the  agency  wins  whenever  a  reasonable  person  could  be  per-
suaded that  more than  one  interpretation  exists-the  principle  will  be
extraordinarily  broad.  Indeed, Justice  Kennedy  has  gone  so  far  as  to
suggest  that  the  agency  view  should  prevail  if the  statute  is  "arguably
ambiguous." 96

The  Court's  own  decisions,  however,  suggest that  the mere fact of
a plausible  alternative  view  is  insufficient  to  trigger  the  Chevron rule.9 7

[Vol.  90:2071

No  verbal  formulation  will  be  completely  helpful  here,  relying  as  it
must  on  undefined  defining  terms. 9 8  But  perhaps  this  will  do:  If the
court has  a  firm  conviction  that  the  agency  interpretation  violates  the
statute,  that  interpretation  must  fail.  This  is  so  even  if a  reasonable
person  might  accept  the  agency's  view.

Consider,  for  example,  INS  v.  Cardoza-Fonseca.9 9  That  case  in-
volved the meaning  of a statutory provision allowing  the Attorney Gen-
eral  to  grant  asylum  to  an  alien  unable  or  unwilling  to  return  to  his
home  country  " 
'because  of persecution  or a well-founded  fear  of per-
secution on account  of race,  religion, nationality,  membership  in a par-
ticular  social  group,  or  political  opinion.'  "100  The  Immigration  and
Naturalization  Service  ("INS")  defined  "well-founded  fear"  to  mean
that an alien must show that it is more probable  than not that she would
be  subject  to  persecution.  Invoking  the statutory  text  and  history,  the
Court  rejected  the  agency's  view.  In  a  concurring  opinion,  Justice
Scalia  said  that the agency  view would  warrant  deference  if there were
ambiguity,  but that  the  statutory  text was  clear.10'

In  fact,  however,  reasonable  people  certainly  could  differ  on
whether  "a  well-founded  fear"  required  a  showing  of probability  of
persecution.  Although  the  Court's  interpretation  ultimately  was  per-
suasive  as  a  matter  of both  text  and  history,  neither  of these  sources
was  unambiguous  on the  point.10 2  The  outcome  in  the case  thus  sug-
gested  that  the  mere  fact  of a plausible  agency  view  is  insufficient  for
deference. 10 3

An  approach  of this  sort appears  to  be  a  sound  understanding  of
Chevron insofar  as the case  recognizes  the primacy  of legislative  instruc-
tions  over  administrative  will. 10 4  Even  in  the  aftermath  of the  New
Deal,  it is  for Congress,  not  the agencies,  to  make  the law.  Any  inter-

Rehnquist,  C.J.,  and  White, J.,  dissenting).

103.  This  conclusion  is  complicated  by  the  fact  that  in  Cardoza-Fonseca the  Court
doubted whether  deference  was  due  to  the agency's  view  on a  "pure  question  of statu-
tory  construction,"  id. at 446, but  it is  confirmed  both  by Justice Scalia's  opinion  in  the
case and  by the outcomes  in Pittston Coal Group v.  Sebben,  109  S.  Ct. 414,  420  (1988),
and Sullivan  v. Zebley,  110  S.  Ct. 885, 894-97  (1990).  In  both cases,  the majority  found
that the agency's  interpretation was contrary  to congressional  instructions,  although  the
dissenters  argued,  plausibly,  that  the  agency's  reading  of  the  statute  was  reasonable.

pretive  approach  must  recognize  that  principle  of priority.  An  under-
standing that would allow  the agency to prevail merely because there  is
some room for  disagreement  would  pose an  undue  threat  to  the  basic
principle  of congressional  supremacy  in  lawmaking,  risking as  it would
administrative subversion  of statutory  standards.  Of course  it remains
true that under Chevron,  the agency  will prevail  even if the  court would
have  chosen  otherwise  had  it been entrusted  with  the power  to  decide
the issue  in  the first  instance.

B.  The Breadth of the Deference Principle and Its Limitations

In  this section,  I explore  possible limitations  on the Chevron princi-
ple.  The most plausible limitations  are  those that  can be  inferred from
actual  congressional  instructions  and,  where  Congress  has  not spoken,
from a reading  of congressional  purposes  in light of the relevant  struc-
tural  principles.  Under  this  approach,  Chevron  is  inapplicable  when
Congress  has not  granted the agency law-interpreting  power  at all and
also 
in  cases 
likely  bias,  most  notably  jurisdictional
determinations.

involving 

1.  Limitation to  Legislative Rules or to  Other Congressional Delegations of
Law-Interpreting Power. - Chevron involved a  "legislative  rule,"  that is  a
rule issued by an  agency pursuant to  a congressional  grant of power  to
promulgate regulations.  For reasons  suggested above,  it is plausible  to
think  that  the  legislative  grant  of rulemaking  power  implicitly  carries
with it the grant of authority  to interpret ambiguities in  the law  that the
agency  is  entrusted  with  administering. 10 5  Somewhat  more  broadly,
Chevron might be taken  to suggest that whenever  an agency is  entrusted
with  implementing  power-whether  to  be  exercised  through  rulemak-
ing or  adjudication-agency  interpretations  in the course  of exercising
that  power  are  entitled  to  respect  so long as  they  are  reasonable.

If this  is  the basis  for Chevron,  the principle  of deference  does  not
extend  to  interpretations  by  agencies  that  have  not  been  granted  the
authority  to  interpret  the law.  For  example,  agencies  that  have  been
entrusted  with the power  to prosecute  violations  but not to  make  rules
lack  the  pedigree  that  is  a  prerequisite  for  deference.  It  follows  that
even  if an  agency  has  been  given  the  power  of interpretation  through
rulemaking, it is not entitled to  deference if it did not exercise rulemak-
ing  power  in  the  particular  case.' 0 6  It follows  even  more  clearly  that
mere litigating positions  are not entitled  to deference. 0 7  And if this  is

mitted  to  administer  the  Act  in  a  manner  that  is  inconsistent  with  the  administrative
structure  that  Congress  enacted  into  law."  Id. at 817.

105.  See supra  notes  92-94 and  accompanying  text.
106.  Thus,  for example,  an  agency  that  has  been  given  power  to make  rules,  but
that simply announces  a view one  way  or another without going through  the rulemaking
process, would  not receive deference.  See the cases  involving "interpretive  rules,"  cited
infra  note  110.

107.  See Bowen v.  Georgetown Univ.  Hosp.,  109  S. Ct. 468, 473  (1988)  ("We have
never  applied  [Chevron] to  agency  litigating  positions  that  are  wholly  unsupported  by

COLUMBIA  LAW  REVIEW

[Vol.  90:2071

so,  Chevron  applies  only  when  an  agency  is  exercising  the  power  to
make rules or otherwise  carrying out legislatively delegated interpretive
authority.

This basic  idea  goes a  long way  toward  making sense  of the entire
dispute  over  the reach  of Chevron.  In  a  recent  case,  the  Court  made
precisely this point, suggesting that a "precondition  to deference under
Chevron  is  a  congressional  delegation  of administrative  authority. ' 10 8
Indeed, Justice  Scalia, an enthusiastic  defender  of the Chevron principle,
has  argued  for a  distinction very  much like  this  one. 109  If agencies  are
simply  interpreting  a  statute,  but have  not  been  granted  the power  to
"administer"  it,  the  principle  of deference  should  not  apply.  And  if
Chevron  does  not  apply  outside  of  the  context  of delegations  of law-
interpreting  power, it is  consistent  with a well-established  body  of pre-
vious  law.' " 0

2.  Pure Questions of Law  Versus Application of Law  to  Fact. - Before
Chevron,  the  law  might  have  been  described  roughly  in  the  following
way:  Agency  decisions  that  involve  pure  issues  of law  are  subject  to
independent judicial examination.  Nojudicial  deference  is appropriate
because  strictly  legal  competence  is  sufficient  to  resolve  the  question.
But decisions  that involve  the application  of law  to fact  call for a differ-
ent standard,  since the agency's  specialized fact-finding  capacity and ac-
countability  are  highly  relevant.  Courts  therefore  should  defer  to
agency  decisions  of this  latter sort."i'

We  might  distinguish,  for  example,  between  (a)  the  question
whether  the Occupational  Safety  and Health  Act requires  the Secretary
of Labor  to show a "significant  risk"  before regulating a carcinogen  and

regulations,  rulings,  or  administrative  practice.");  Securities  Indus.  Ass'n  v.  Board  of

(b)  the  question  whether  benzene,  an  acknowledged  carcinogen,  cre-
ates  a  "significant  risk." 112  For the  first  question,  strictly  legal  exper-
tise  seems relevant.  For  the latter question,  it is  the  agency  that has  a
comparative  advantage.  Deference  might be accorded  on the latter but
not the former.  Similarly,  in the leading pre-Chevron case,  the Supreme
Court  appeared  to  decide  independently  the  purely  legal  question
included  independent  con-
whether  the  statutory  term  "employees" 
tractors,  but to defer  to  the National  Labor  Relations  Board ("NLRB")
on the mixed question whether newsboys qualified  as employees  within
the  National  Labor  Relations  Act. 1
3

This approach  has a  good  deal  to  be said  in its favor.  Above  all, it
is  a plausible  reconstruction  of Congress's  interpretive  instructions.  If
the agency  is simply  saying what  the statute  means,  it is  making  a deci-
sion  that at least  ordinarily  calls  into  play  distinctly  legal  competence.
The  best  inference  is  probably  that  Congress  wants  courts  to  answer
these inquiries.  But the agency's  own  capacities  are  conspicuously  per-
tinent  when it is  applying law  to fact,  and in  these cases  the best recon-
struction of legislative  instructions  is that the decision is for the agency.
It is not surprising  that several  courts,  including  the Supreme  Court  in
a post-Chevron opinion written by justice Stevens, 1 4 have  accepted pre-
cisely  this  line  of argument.

There  are,  however,  at  least  three  problems  with  this  approach.
First,  the  resolution  of statutory  ambiguities  may  call  for  the agency's
specialized  capacities,  even if the issue appears  to be purely  one of law.
It  is  at  least  plausible  that  the  agency's  competence  is  relevant  to  the
question  whether  a statute  regulating  carcinogens  requires  the  agency
to  show a "significant  risk."  The resolution  of the ambiguity might well
call  for  an  understanding  of the  disadvantages  and  advantages  of any
requirement  of this  sort.  As  we  have  seen,  resolution  of ambiguities
often  calls  for  an assessment  of issues of policy  and principle. 1 5  That
assessment  is  best  made  by  agencies  rather  than  courts.

Second,  the  line  between  purely  legal  and  mixed  questions  is  ex-
tremely thin.  In some  cases  it will  be  hard to  tell on  which  side  of the
line  a  particular  question  falls.  A broader  approach  to  Chevron,  apply-
ing  the rule  of deference  in  all  cases,  has  the  virtue  of simplicity  and
ease  of application. 1 16  Third,  Chevron  itself quite  plausibly  involved  a
pure  question  of law  rather than  application  of law  to  fact.117  The  dis-
tinction  between  the  two  is  therefore  in  some  tension  with  Chevron  it-

self.  Even  in  pure  questions  of law,  then,  deference  is  probably  due
unless  there  is  some  independent  reason  for  distrusting  the  agency.

3.  Cases Involving  the Agency's  Specialized Competence.  - Even  if the
distinction  between  purely  legal  and  mixed  questions  cannot  be  sus-
tained,  perhaps  courts  should  use  the  considerations  that it  embodies
in  order  to  give  deference  when,  simply,  it  is  due.  Deference  is  due
when a matter within the agency's  competence  is at issue;  courts should
review agency decisions  independently when  it is not.  On this  account,
the  problem  with  the  distinction  between  mixed  questions  and  pure
questions  of law  is  that it is  too crude  and indirect  a proxy  for the rele-
vant  question, which  is  the comparative  competence  of the agency  and
the court.  In  Chevron,  deference  was  appropriate  because  the agency's
competence  was  highly  relevant,  whether  or  not  the  question  was  a
"pure"  one  of law.  So  too,  an  agency's  competence  is  relevant  in  de-
ciding, for example, whether newsboys  qualify  as  employees  within  the
meaning  of  the  National  Labor  Relations  Act," l8  or  whether  there
should  be a  de  minimis  exception  to  a statutory  ban  on the  use  of car-
cinogens  as  food  additives. 1 9  In  the latter  case,  the consequences  of
the exception probably  bear on the meaning  of the statute.1 20  The line
between  independent  review  and  Chevron's  deference,  then,  should
turn directly  on  questions  of relative  competence.

This position has  much  to be  said in its favor.  Indeed,  it is  difficult
to quarrel  with the proposition that courts should  defer when,  and only
when, agencies  have  a comparative  advantage.  That  proposition  is  one
to which  Congress  is highly  likely  to  subscribe and should  therefore  be
attributed to  Congress when  the national legislature  has not spoken.  It
is  highly  likely  that some version  of this  idea  is and will  remain  the law,
whether  or not it is  explicitly  adopted  by reviewing  courts.

The principal  problem  with the use of this  idea  as a  test for deter-
mining  whether  deference  is  due  is  that  the  inquiry  into  comparative
competence  in particular  cases  will  be  complex.  By  contrast,  a  bright-
line  rule of deference  has  the  comparative  virtue  of simplicity.  More-
over,  a  broader  approach  to  Chevron  would  reflect  a  recognition  that
administrative  competence  is implicated in many hard cases  of statutory

Ct. 2668,  2676-79  (1990),  in which the  Court accepted  the agency's  interpretation  after
considering  Congress's  interpretive  instructions  and  concluding  that  neither  they  nor
"any  of the  other traditional  tools  of statutory construction  compel"  a  conclusion  con-
trary  to the  agency's  interpretation.  Id.  at 2677.  The Court also  considered  the ration-
ality of the agency's  interpretation and concluded  that "the judgments about  the way  the
real world works  that have gone  into  the [agency's  interpretation]  are precisely  the kind
that agencies  are  better equipped to make  than are  courts.  This practical agency  exper-
tise  is  one  of the  principal justifications  behind  Chevron deference."  Id.  at 2679  (foot-

construction.  For  these  reasons,  an  ad hoc  inquiry  into  administrative
competence  would be an  exceptionally poor way  to handle  the question
whether  Chevron applies.  The  relevant  considerations  can  be  captured
more  sensibly  by  creating  more  general  exceptions  to  the  deference
principle.

4.  Agency Jurisdiction. - Does  an  agency  have  the  authority  to  de-
cide  on its  own jurisdiction?  Chevron does  not say.  At  least  if  the  dis-
tinction  between  jurisdictional  and  nonjurisdictional  determinations
could  be  easily  and  sharply  drawn,  it  would  be  tempting  to  say  that
Chevron is inapplicable  to the  former.  If,  for example,  the Federal Com-
munications  Commission  ("FCC") is  deciding whether  it has  the power
to  regulate  cable  television, 12 1  or  the  NLRB  whether  it  can  regulate
independent  contractors,1 22  one might  think  that  the rule  of deference
ought  not  to  apply.  In  Anglo-American  law,  those  limited  by  law  are
generally  not empowered  to decide on the meaning  of the limitation. 123
When  Congress  creates  an  agency,  perhaps  it  should  be  understood
nof to have given  the agency  the authority  to decide  on the extent  of its
own  powers.

The  issue  has  been  discussed  by  two Justices  skeptical  of the  dis-
tinction  between jurisdictional  and  nonjurisdictional  issues, 124  and  by

121.  See  United  States v.  Southwestern  Cable  Co., 392  U.S.  157,  165-67  (1968).

123.  See  The  Federalist  No.  78  (A.  Hamilton);  Marbury  v.  Madison,  5  U.S.  (1
Cranch)  137,  176  (1803)  ("To what purpose  are powers limited ...  if these limits  may, at
any  time,  be  passed  by  those  intended  to  be  restrained?").  There  are  some  notable
exceptions.  The most important is  the judiciary, which can  interpret constitutional  pro-
visions  and  statutes  conferring jurisdiction  on  it.  See also  Katzenbach  v.  Morgan,  384
U.S.  641,  648-51  (1966)  (suggesting  that  Congress  can  define  substantive  content  of
fourteenth  amendment,  and 
to  that  extent  its  own  powers  under  § 5  of  that
amendment).

124.  See  Dole v.  United  Steelworkers  of Am.,  110  S.  Ct. 929,  944  (1990)  (White, J.,
dissenting);  Mississippi  Power  & Light  Co.  v.  Mississippi,  108  S.  Ct.  2428,  2442-45
(1988)  (Scalia, J.,  concurring).  Justice  Scalia's  argument  has  considerable  force:

[I]t is plain that giving  deference  to an administrative  interpretation  of its statu-
tory jurisdiction  or authority  is  both necessary  and  appropriate.  It is  necessary
because there is no discernible  line between  an agency's  exceeding its authority
and  an  agency's  exceeding  authorized  application  of its  authority.  To exceed
authorized  application  is  to exceed  authority.  Virtually  any  administrative  ac-
tion can  be  characterized  as  either the one or the  other,  depending  upon  how
generally one  wishes  to describe  the  "authority."  And  deference  is appropriate
because  it  is  consistent  with  the  general  rationale  for  deference:  Congress
would  naturally  expect that the  agency would  be responsible,  within broad lim-
its,  for resolving  ambiguities  in  its statutory  authority  or jurisdiction.

Id. at 2444  (citations  omitted).

The  principal  weakness  in  this argument  is  the claim  about  Congress's  natural  ex-
pectation.  In most  cases,  Congress  probably  has no  expectation  one  way  or  the  other.
The  depiction  of its  expectations  is largely an  act  of construction  rather  than discovery.
Moreover,  there are  good reasons  to believe  that the  best reconstruction  of Congress's
desires  is  in  favor of independent judicial  review  here,  because  of the  risk  of bias  and
self-dealing  on  the  agency's  part.  Finally,  the  distinction  between  jurisdictional  and

others  insistent on that distinction.1 2 5  In  a few  cases  the Court appears
to  have  deferred  to  agency  decisions  on  questions  that  were  at  least
plausibly  jurisdictional.12 6  In  a  recent  case,  however,  the  Court  said

nonjurisdictional  decisions  is in fact  "discernible,"  at least if it is  understood  in  the way
suggested  infra  at notes  136-139  and  accompanying  text.

Note,  however,  that  the  idea  that  agencies  are  likely  to  be biased  when  extending
their  authority, but not  when  they are  limiting it, tends to build into  deference  doctrine
an  antiregulatory  "tilt,"  one  that  is  likely  to  be  inconsistent  with  the  very  decision  to
create  the  agency  in  question.  See infra  notes  136-139  and  accompanying  text.

. may  indeed  conflict  .

Our agency deference  cases have always been  limited  to statutes the agency was
"entrusted  to  administer."  Agencies  do  not  "administer"  statutes  confining
the scope  of their jurisdiction,  and  such  statutes  are  not  "entrusted"  to  agen-
cies.  Nor  do  the  normal  reasons  for agency  deference  apply.  First,  statutes
confining an agency's jurisdiction  do not  reflect conflicts  between  policies  that
have been  committed  to the agency's  care, but rather reflect  policies  in favor of
limiting  the  agency's jurisdiction  that  .
. with  the
agency's institutional  interests  in expanding its own power.  Second,  for similar
reasons, agencies  can claim no special  expertise in  interpreting a statute confin-
ing  its jurisdiction.  Finally,  we  cannot  presume  that  Congress  implicitly  in-
tended  an  agency  to fill  "gaps"  in a  statute confining  the agency's jurisdiction,
since  by its nature  such  a statute manifests  an unwillingness  to give the  agency
the  freedom  to  define  the  scope  of its  own  power.
The  D.C. Circuit has also suggested  that deference  may  not be appropriate  onjuris-
dictional  questions.  See The Business Roundtable  v.  SEC,  905  F.2d 406, 413-14  (D.C.
Cir.  1990); New York Shipping Ass'n v.  Federal  Maritime Comm'n,  854 F.2d  1338,  1363
(D.C.  Cir. 1988)  ("[I]t would..,  be inappropriate  for us to defer to the agency  where, as
here,  it  is  interpreting  not  the  meaning  of  a  statute  that  Congress  has  charged  it  to
administer,  but rather  a statute  merely  delimiting its jurisdiction  as  against  that  of the
authorities  charged  with  administration  of the  labor  laws.");  National  Wildlife  Fed'n  v.
ICC,  850  F.2d  694, 699  n.6  (D.C.  Cir.  1988)  (agency interpretation  serving  to  increase
its  own authority  or jurisdiction raises  special  concerns).

.

The weaknesses  injustice Brennan's  analysis are twofold.  First, parts  of the analysis
assume that  the jurisdictional limitation  is  clear, in which  case the  decision  about defer-
ence is  irrelevant.  Second,  agency  expertise  may  in fact  be relevant  to  a jurisdictional
question,  as  noted in  the  text.

that  while  "agency  determinations  within  the  scope  of delegated  au-
thority are  entitled  to  deference,"  an agency" 
'may  not bootstrap  itself
into  an area in which  it has  no jurisdiction.'  "127  The passage  suggests
that jurisdictional  determinations  will  not  receive  deference.  But  it is
somewhat  ambiguous,  and  there  is  as  yet  no  clear  answer  to  this
question.

Because  congressional  instructions  are crucial  here,  courts  should
probably  refuse  to  defer  to  agency  decisions  with  respect  to  issues  of
jurisdiction-again,  if we assume  that the distinction  between jurisdic-
tional  and  nonjurisdictional  questions  is  easily  administrable.  The
principal reason  is that Congress  would  be unlikely  to want  agencies  to
have  the  authority  to  decide  on  the  extent  of their  own  powers.  To
accord  such power  to agencies  would  be to  allow  them  to be judges  in
their  own  cause,  in  which  they  are  of course  susceptible  to  bias.

Consider,  for  example,  Dole  v.  United  Steelworkers  of America.128
There  the  issue  was  whether  the  Office  of Management  and  Budget
("OMB")  had  the  authority  under  the  Paperwork  Reduction  Act  of
1980129  to  approve  or  disapprove  agency  rules requiring  regulated  en-
tities  to  disclose  information  directly  to  consumers,  employees,  or
others.  OMB argued  that  the  statutory  words  allowing  it  to  review
rules  regarding  the  "'obtaining  or  soliciting  of  facts  by  an  agency
through  ... 
reporting  or recordkeeping  requirements'"  included  dis-
closure rules.13 0  The  Court concluded  otherwise,  saying that the words
"by  an  agency"  meant information  gathered  by  the  agency for its  own
use  rather  than  for  disclosure  to  others.13 1  Because  the  Court  found
the statute unambiguous  in  denying reviewing authority  to OMB,  it did
not have  to  explore  the issue  of deference.  But it would  have  seemed
exceedingly  odd to  suggest that OMB should  be allowed  to resolve  am-
biguities  in a statute governing its own jurisdiction.  The danger  of bias
and  self-dealing  is  so  great  as  to  make  OMB an  interested  party.

As  Justice  Scalia  has  emphasized,  however,  there  would  be  some
difficulty in administering the sometimes elusive distinction between ju-
risdictional and  nonjurisdictional  questions.13 2  In  some cases  in which
an  agency is  said  to  have  exceeded  its  authority,  or acted  unlawfully,  it
might  also  be  said  to  have  exceeded  its  jurisdiction.13 3  Moreover,
agency  expertise and accountability  are  often relevant  to the resolution

COLUMBIA  LAW  REVIEW

(Vol.  90:2071

of a jurisdictional  ambiguity.  In  the  absence  of a  clear  congressional
answer  to  the  question,  for  example,  the  comparative  competence  of
the  FCC  might well  bear  on  whether  federal  regulatory  authority  ex-
tends  to  cable  television.1 34  When  Congress  has  not  spoken  clearly,
whether  the Commodity  Futures Trading  Commission has adjudicative
authority  over  common  law  counterclaims  might  well  depend  on  the
consequences  of the  exercise  of that authority  for  the fair  and efficient
administration  of the Commodity Exchange Act. 135  For these  reasons,
it would be at least plausible to  suggest that a general rule of deference
would  be  preferable  even  on jurisdictional  questions,  because  of  its
greater ease  of application  and because  the agency's  competence  bears
on  the resolution  of jurisdictional  ambiguities.

Probably  the best reconciliation  of the competing considerations  of
expertise,  accountability,  and  partiality  is  to  say  that  no  deference  will
be  accorded  to  the  agency  when  the issue  is  whether  the  agency's  au-
thority  extends  to  a broad  area  of regulation,  or to  a  large  category  of
cases,  except  to  the  extent  that  the  answer  to  that  question  calls  for
determinations  of fact  and  policy.1 3 6  On  this  approach,  there  is  no
magic  in  the word  "jurisdiction."  Instead,  the question  is  whether  the
agency  is  seeking  to  extend  its  legal  power  to  an  entire  category  of
cases,  rather than  disposing of certain cases  in a certain way  or acting in
one  or a  few  cases.  This  distinction  it  is  not  always  extremely  sharp,
and  it will  call  for an  exercise  ofjudgment.  But in the vast  majority  of
cases,  it is  easily  administered.

It should also  follow  that agencies  will not receive  deference  when
they  are  denying  their  authority  to  deal  with  a  large  category  of
cases.1 3 7  Here  too  the agency determination  is jurisdictional.  Here  too
there is  a  risk of bias,  in  the form not  of self-dealing,  but instead  of an
abdication of enforcement  power.  Because  abdication has been a major
legislative  fear,13 8  and  because  deference  doctrine  should  not  contain
an  antiregulatory  bias,  Chevron should  be  inapplicable  here as  well. 13 9

provision  stating  that  the  EEOC  had jurisdiction,  and  the  complaint  was  timely  filed,

5.  Agency  Bias.  - We  might  generalize  the  discussion  of jurisdic-
tional  determinations  by  supposing  that  the  question  at  issue  is  one
with respect  to which  agency bias is peculiarly  likely to be  at work.  The
agency  might  be  deciding  whether  its  own  decisions  are  reviewable,
whether it has the power to issue fines,  whether its authority  extends to
new  or  unforeseen  areas,  or,  perhaps  more controversially,  whether  it
is  compelled  to undertake  action  that  it prefers  not to  undertake-for
example,  vigorous  enforcement  of  federal  environmental  controls-
perhaps  because  of the  pressures  imposed  by  well-organized  private
groups.  In  all  of these  cases,  the  likelihood  of agency  bias  and  self-
dealing  might  be  serious.  It would  be  peculiar,  therefore,  to  defer  to
the  agency's  views.  This  issue  is  one  of particular  importance,  espe-
cially  in  a period  in which  Congress  is  likely  to  be  enacting  regulatory
controls 
the  executive  branch  has  expressed
ambivalence.140

toward  which 

If Chevron  applies  only  when  the  agency  has  been  delegated  law-
making  authority, much  of this  problem will  disappear.  To be  sure, an
agency's  view  that its  own  decisions  are  unreviewable,  that  it need  not
undertake  certain  action,  or that it has  (or does  not have)  the power to
issue  fines  will  amount  to  an  "interpretation."  But  the  expression  of
these  views  is  unlikely  to  be  part  of the exercise  of authority  that  has
been  congressionally  granted.  In  these  cases,  an agency's  claim  of im-
munity  from the judiciary  could  not  easily  be  seen  as  part  of its  dele-
gated  rulemaking  power.  In  rare  cases,  however,  an  agency  might
interpret  a  statute  in  a  way  that  predictably  lines  up  with  agency  self-
interest  or  bias  even  while  exercising  delegated  authority.  In  these
cases,  the rule of deference  should probably  be  inapplicable,  since  def-
erence  would  be a  poor reading  of congressional  instructions.

Chevron's principle  of deference,  then, is  an  attempted  reconstruc-
tion  of congressional  instructions,  one that is responsive to  the compar-
ative  advantages  of the  agency  in  administering  complex  statutes.  It
follows  that the  principle  is  inapplicable  when  the best  reconstruction
argues  against deference.  We have  seen that  when the  agency has  not
been accorded law-interpreting  power, no deference  is due.  Independ-
ent judicial  assessments  are  also  appropriate  in  other  contexts  involv-
ing  predictable  bias,  most  notably jurisdictional  determinations,  but
also in other cases in which the agency's  self-interest is conspicuously  at
stake.

6.  Agency  Views  that Are  New  or  that Depart from  Past Practices.
Before Chevron, agency decisions were  entitled to deference  if they were
longstanding,  consistent,  and  contemporaneous;  but  new  interpreta-

tions  were  subject  to more  stringent judicial  scrutiny.1 4 1  The  reasons
for  this  distinction  never  have  been  entirely  clear.  Perhaps  the special
deference  accorded  to longstanding  interpretations  embodied  an effort
to import principles  of stare  decisis  into  administrative  processes in  or-
der  to  protect  reliance  and  expectations.  Perhaps  the  distinction  was
part  of an  effort  to  constrain  administrative  wilfulness  or  the  use  of
"politics,"  perhaps understood  as interest  group power, to  distort  stat-
utory  meaning.  Perhaps  this  distinction  was  built  on  a  belief  that  a
longstanding  interpretation  probably  tracked  congressional  will,  at  the
stage  of enactment  and  after, and  was  therefore  correct  as  a  matter  of
statutory meaning.  If these were  the underlying  ideas,  an  agency  deci-
sion  that  was  novel  or  merely  one  of an  inconsistent  line  of decisions
would  not  warrant deference.  That  decision  would  hardly  protect  ex-
pectations  and  reliance,  and  it  could  not  confidently  be  said  to  be  a
correct  understanding  of what  Congress  wanted.

On  several  occasions  after  Chevron  the  Court  has  reasserted  pre-
cisely  this position. 14 2  But if Chevron is right,  this position is  wrong,  or
at least  it draws  the  distinction  between  longstanding  and  novel  inter-
pretations  too sharply.' 4 3  As  we have  seen,  Chevron is best defended  in
part  as  a  means  of counteracting  problems  of rigidity,  obsolescence,
and changed  circumstances  in the regulatory  process.' 4 4  The problem
of changed  circumstances  is a  serious  one for textual  commands,  which
are  difficult to amend  in light of competing  demands  on the legislators'
time.  As  a  result, courts have  sometimes  taken  account  of changed  cir-
cumstances  in  order  to  render  a  novel  interpretation,  one  that  makes
sense  of those  commands  or  even  remains  faithful  to  them  in  light  of
new developments. 145  But because of their fact-finding capacities,  elec-
toral  accountability,  and  continuing  attention  to  changed  circum-
stances,  agencies  are far  better  situated  than  courts  to  soften  statutory

rigidities  or to  adapt  their terms  to  unanticipated  conditions.14 6

All  this  might suggest  that  an agency's  new interpretations  should
be  entitled  to  the same  basic  deference  as  old ones.  Agency  decisions
about  the meaning  of ambiguous  statutes  often  turn  in  part  on  ques-
tions  of policy.  For an agency to interpret  a statute one way rather than
another  is  for  it  to  set  out  a  view  that  is  permissible  rather  than
mandatory.  Under Chevron, agency views receive deference not because
they  capture  a unitary intended  meaning, but because  the resolution  of
statutory ambiguities  should  be undertaken by  accountable,  specialized
administrators,  not by courts.  Under this  approach, it matters  relatively
little whether the agency decision is longstanding and consistent  or not.
Regulatory shifts  from one administration to another  should be entirely
expected  and  indeed  welcomed  as  a  healthy  part  of democratic  self-
government  or  as  a recognition  of changed  circumstances.  So  long  as
the statute  is  ambiguous,  those  shifts  reflect legitimate  changes  of pol-
icy.  One might  expect, then, that after Chevron agency  decisions  will be
entitled  to  deference  even  if they  are  novel.

The  question  is  somewhat  more  complex,  however,  than  the  dis-
cussion  thus  far  suggests.  As  we have  seen, a  longstanding  agency  in-
terpretation  might receive deference  because of an interest  in a form of
administrative stare decisis.  If this is  so, a new interpretation is  entitled
to  somewhat  less  deference  than  one  that is  longstanding.  In  a recent
case,  the Supreme  Court  has  recognized  this  point  and,  indeed,  gone
somewhat  further.  In  a partial  qualification  of Chevron,  the Court  held
in Maislin Industries, U.S.,  Inc. v.  Primary Steel, Inc. 147  that  agencies  may
not  depart  from  an  agency  interpretation  that  the  Court  has  upheld,
even  in  the face  of changed  circumstances.' 48  The  case  should  proba-
bly be read to say that an agency may not depart from an interpretation
that  the  Court  has  held  to  be  statutorily  mandated.  It  should  not  be
taken  to  say  that a  merely permissible  interpretation  is  set  in  stone, or
that an agency may not take account  of changed  circumstances  in giving
meaning  to  an  ambiguous  mandate,  or  a  mandate  that  new  develop-
ments  have  rendered  ambiguous. 4 9

lower  rate.  According  to the  ICC, two  changed circumstances  required this shift.  First,
carriers  and  shippers  had frequently  negotiated  lower  rates  that were  not filed  with the

[Vol.  90:2071

Two  conclusions  follow.  First,  and  most  importantly,  agencies
should  be  allowed  to  depart  from  interpretations  by  prior  administra-
tions,  certainly in the face of changed  conditions, but also  to reflect  new
views  about policy.  What  is necessary  is  that the new interpretation  be
explained  as  reasonable  in  light  of statutorily  permissible  factors. 15 0
Second,  new  departures  should  be  accorded  somewhat  less  deference
than  longstanding  interpretations,  for reasons  analogous  to  those  that
justify  stare  decisis  in  the judicial  context.

C.  Chevron's  Second Step:  The Reasonableness of the Agency's  Interpretation

I  have noted  that Chevron sets  out a  two-step process  for analyzing
agency interpretations.  Even if Congress  has not directly addressed  the
issue  in  question,  and  even  if deference  is  due,  the  agency's  decision
must  be  "reasonable." 15'1  The  Supreme  Court  has  given  little  explicit
guidance  for  determining  when  interpretations  will  be  found  reason-
able.  In  most  of the  cases  rejecting  an  agency's  view,  the  Court  has
relied on the first step  of Chevron, finding an explicit congressional deci-
sion  on  the point.

ICC.  In some  of those cases,  the carrier later filed for bankruptcy,  and  the trustee  billed
the  shipper for the  difference  between  the  tariff and  the negotiated  rate.  The ICC con-
cluded  that in these  circumstances  it would  be unfair  and  irrational  not to  consider  the
shipper's  equitable defenses  to a claim  for undercharges.  Second,  the Motor Carrier Act
of  1980,  significantly  deregulating  the  motor  carrier  industry, justified  the  change  in
policy,  since  under the  new  circumstances  of competition  strict  application  of the filed
rate  was  unnecessary  to  deter  discrimination.  See  id.  at  2762-64.

In  rejecting  the  ICC's  position,  the  Court  emphasized  some  of its  early  decisions,
e.g.,  Louisville  & N.  Ry.  v.  Maxwell,  237  U.S.  94  (1915);  Texas  & P.  Ry.  v.  Mugg,  202
U.S.  242  (1906),  creating  a  requirement  of  strict  adherence  to  the  filed  rate  require-
ments  and  disallowing  equitable  defenses  to  collection  of the  filed  tariff.  See  Maislin,
110  S.  Ct. at 2766-67.  But it is  not  clear  that  those decisions  meant  that  the  agency's
view  was required  rather  than  merely permitted,  and  in  any  case  statutory changes  had
converted  a system  of regulated monopoly  into an  extremely  competitive market.  Noth-
ing in  the statute's  text expressly  prohibited  the  agency's  shift  in  position.  The central
statutory  term  is  "reasonable,"  and  the  change  in  the  nature  of  the  industry  made  it
plausible  for the  agency  to  find  reasonable  what  was  once  unreasonable.  Indeed,  the
agency's  shift adapted  legislative  instructions  sensibly  to  new  conditions;  little or  noth-
ing could  be  said,  as a matter  of sound  policy,  against  the  agency's  view.  It is  in  these
circumstances  that deference  to the agency, rather  than mechanical  use of an  ambiguous
statute, is  especially appropriate.  Cf.  supra note 89, infra  note  216  (discussing mechani-
cal  definition  of "solid  waste").  But see  Pittston Coal Group v.  Sebben,  109 S.  Ct. 414,
419-21  (1988)  (literal interpretation  used to forbid  agency from reaching sensible  result
not realistically  inconsistent with  statute);  Public Citizen v.  Young, 831  F.2d  1108,  1113
(D.C.  Cir.  1987)  (mechanically  interpreting  Delaney  Clause  of Color Additive  Amend-
ments  of Food,  Drug & Cosmetic  Act  to forbid  agency from allowing  de minimis excep-
tions),  cert.  denied,  108  S.  Ct.  1470  (1988).

On  the  question  of reasonableness,  it seems  clear  that  the agency
must  be  given  considerable  latitude.  But  this  is  not  to  say  that  the
agency  may do  whatever  it wishes.  The  reasonableness  inquiry should
probably  be  seen  as  similar  to  the  inquiry  into  whether  the  agency's
decision  is  "arbitrary"  or  "capricious"  within  the  meaning  of  the
APA. 15 2  That  inquiry  requires  the  agency  to  give  a  detailed  explana-
tion  of its  decision  by  reference  to  factors  that  are relevant  under  the
governing statute.1 55  And while  some decisions  will be  reversed  or re-
manded  under  this  approach, 154  it is clear  that within  a wide range  the
choice  of policy is  for  the agency. 15 5

III.  INTERPRETIVE  PRINCIPLES

Thus  far  I  have  discussed  the  Chevron  principle  as  if  it  stood
alone-that  is,  as if it provided  the only  applicable  interpretive  princi-
ple, and was  not in conflict with  other possible principles.  In fact,  how-
ever,  the  principle  of  deference  is  merely  one  of  a  large  number  of
interpretive  principles  or norms  playing  a major role in  statutory  con-
struction  as  that  process  occurs  in  courts,  agencies,  and  elsewhere.  In
some cases in which Chevron would  otherwise govern, other interpretive
norms  may  require  a  rejection  of the  agency's  position.

In  this  Part,  I  discuss  the  relationship  between  Chevron and  other
relevant principles.  I conclude that Chevron is plainly  overcome by prin-
ciples  that help  to  ascertain  congressional  instructions.  Norms  calling
for  an  explicit  legislative  statement  before  certain  results  may  be
reached  also  overcome  the  principle  of deference;  the  reason  is  that
those  norms  are  designed  to  ensure  congressional  deliberation  on  the
questions  involved.  The  same  is  true  for  other  norms  designed  to
counteract  governmental  bias  or  to  protect  legislative  processes.
Norms  against  regulatory  irrationality  or absurdity,  however,  are  usu-
ally  defeated  by  Chevron,  since  determinations  of  rationality  are  for
agencies  rather  than  courts. 156

Co.,  463  U.S.  29,  43  (1983)  ("Normally,  an agency  rule would  be  arbitrary  and capri-
cious  if the agency has relied  on factors  which Congress  has not intended it to consider,
entirely  failed  to  consider an  important  aspect  of the  problem,  offered  an  explanation
for its decision  that runs counter  to the  evidence before  the agency,  or is so implausible
that it could not be ascribed to a difference  in view or the product of agency  expertise.");

reasonableness,  as  does  the APA,  5  U.S.C.  § 706  (1988).  The point is  that in the after-
math  of Chevron,  courts  should be  reluctant  to use norms  against irrationality  to invali-

A.  In General

Notwithstanding  Karl  Llewellyn's  celebrated  effort to  demolish the
canons  of construction  by  showing  their  tendency  toward  vacuity  and
self-contradiction, 15 7  interpretive  principles  of various  sorts  continue
to  be  an  important  part  of current  law.' 58  Statutory  ambiguity  is  com-
mon.  In  the  face  of ambiguity,  outcomes  must  turn  on  interpretive
principles  of various  sorts;  there  is simply  no  other way  to  decide hard
cases. 1 59  Any volume  of the Federal  Reporter  or the United  States Re-
ports  will turn up a wide range of interpretive principles.  These princi-
ples  exist not  only because  they are  indispensable  to  decision,  but also
because  many  of them  ieflect  grammatical,  institutional,  or  substantive
understandings  that  have  or warrant  widespread  support.

The  point  goes  deeper  still.  Whether  there  is  ambiguity-the
nominal  trigger  for  deference  under  Chevron-is a  function  not  "sim-
ply"  of text, but of text as  it interacts  with principles  of interpretation,
some of them  deeply  engrained  in the legal  culture  or even  the culture
more  generally.  A  major  current  task  is  to  assign  Chevron  its  place
within  the universe  of these principles.  That task raises  the question  of
what  constitutes  "ambiguity"  and  of why  and  when  "ambiguity"  is  a
sufficient  reason for  deference.

For present  purposes  it  will  be  useful  to  begin  by  distinguishing
among  three sorts  of interpretive  principles.  All  of them  are  pervasive.
Syntactic principles help  to  discern  statutory  meaning  in  the  particular
case.  Courts  sometimes  rely on  explicit  and  implicit  interpretive instruc-
tions  from  Congress  about how  statutes  should  be  construed.  Substan-
tive  principles  attempt 
to  carry  out  policies,  some  of  them  with
constitutional  status,  that  cannot  be  tied  to any  legislative judgment.

Syntactic  principles  include  a  wide  range  of practices  and  ideas:
not  merely  the  ordinary  rules  of language,  but  also  the  frequently
stated  notions  that  a  specific  provision  will  trump  a  general  provision
when  there  is a  conflict;' 60  that when  general  words  follow  a particular

date  agency  decisions,  since  the  agency  is  in  a  better  position  to  judge  whether  a
particular  rule  is rational  or not.

157.  See Llewellyn,  Remarks  on the Theory  of Appellate  Decision and the  Rules or

Canons About  How  Statutes  Are  To Be  Construed,  3 Vand.  L. Rev.  395  (1950).

158.  I  will  use  the  terms  "canons,"  "norms,"  and  "interpretive  principles"  inter-

changeably  in  this  discussion.

159.  In fact,  interpretive  principles  are at work even  in easy  cases,  or those  appear-
ing  to contain  no  ambiguity.  Cases are  easy  only when  and  because the  relevant  inter-
pretive  principles  are  not a matter  of dispute.  See  Sunstein,  supra  note 26,  at 464-65.
There are  no easy cases  without interpretive  principles,  which are necessary  to give  con-
text,  and  hence  meaning,  to  language.  To  say  that  interpretive  principles  are  not  at
stake  is actually  to say  that the  relevant  principles are  supported by  a consensus,  so  that
there is  no  dispute  about  their  application  or meaning.

I  deal  here  with  interpretive  principles  that  are  conspicuous  or  contestable,  in  the
sense that they  are  self-consciously  invoked as part of the process  of resolving ambigui-
ties  or cases  otherwise  in  or close  to  equipoise.

enumeration,  they  will  be  defined  by  reference  to  the  particular
enumeration; 16 1 that every word in a statute  will be given effect; 16 2 that
when  Congress  has  specified  the category  of people entitled  to a good,
there  might  be  an  inference  that  the  people  not  expressly  mentioned
are  not  so  entitled. 16 3  Some  of these  principles  are  controversial,  and
their  application  in  particular  cases  will  of course  be  a  source  of dis-
pute.  But the use of syntactic  principles,  as a way of discerning  legisla-
tive instructions,  is  an  ordinary  part  of statutory  interpretation.

Interpretive  instructions  include,  least controversially,  explicit leg-
islative  guidance  about statutory  interpretation.  The  first provisions  of
the United  States  Code provide a long  list of these instructions, 164  and
other more particular  statutes furnish  similar guidance. 16 5  Some prin-
ciples  of interpretation  reflect  implicit  rather than  explicit interpretive
instructions.  Thus, for example,  the idea that statutes will be  construed
to be  valid rather than  invalid, 166  and  the principle  that appropriations
statutes  will  be  narrowly  construed,' 6 7  seem  to  be  an  accurate  recon-
struction  of likely  legislative  wishes.  Congress  would  prefer  validation
to invalidation,  and  its  own  rules and  practices  limit the  consequences
of appropriations  measures.

Substantive principles  are sometimes highly controversial,  but they
play  an  extremely  prominent  role in statutory  interpretation.  Some  of
these  principles  are  designed  to  allocate  authority  among  various  gov-
ernmental  entities.  Some  of them  are  more  frankly  designed  to  pro-
duce particular outcomes.  Many  of these principles  are  constitutionally
inspired, as in  the idea that federal  statutes will not lightly be  construed
so  as  to  preempt  state law; 168  that judicial  review  of agency  action  will
be  presumed  available;' 6 9  that  statutes  will  be  construed  so  as  not  to
interfere  with  the power  of the President. 170  Some  of these  principles
serve  other defensible  substantive  goals; these  include the idea  that ex-
emptions  from the antitrust  and tax laws  will be  narrowly  construed,' 7'

that statutes  will  be interpreted  so  as  not to apply  retroactively, 172  that
implied  repeals will be  disfavored, 173  and that federal statutes  and trea-
ties  will  be construed  generously  to  the Indian  tribes. 17 4  The category
of substantive  norms  is  not  fixed but  changes  over time,  with  new  as-
sessments  of what norms are well adapted  to  the functions  and  failures
of government.

B.  Chevron  and the  Interpretive Principles

What  bearing  does  Chevron have  on the principles  of construction?
Notably,  Chevron itself creates  an interpretive  principle,  and if it is  to be
defended,  it must  probably  be  as  one  that reflects  implicit  interpretive
instructions  or that  satisfies  institutional  goals.' 75  It  is  not  difficult  to
imagine  a conflict between  the Chevron principle  and one or more of the
other interpretive  principles.  Imagine, for  example,  that an agency  in-
terprets  a  statute in  a manner  that  raises  a  serious  constitutional  ques-
tion,  preempt  state  law,  or  unfavorably  to  the  Indian  tribes.  The
problem  has  arisen specifically  in cases  in which  agency interpretations
competed  with  the  norms  against  retroactivity 76  and  against  implied
exemptions  from antitrust laws. 177

In these  cases,  the issue is  whether Chevron will  displace  or  be  dis-
placed  by  otherwise  applicable  interpretive  norms.  That  issue  in  turn
implicates  a wide range  of questions  about the relationships  among dif-
ferent interpretive  norms,  created  as  they  were  in vastly  different  peri-
ods  and  designed  for  dramatically  different  institutional  arrangements
and  substantive  concerns.  Here  as  well  the  traditional  legal  culture  is
confronted  by an  administrative  system built on a  novel  set of substan-
tive and  institutional  premises.

In the discussion  that follows,  I propose  to  answer  these questions
by disentangling  the functions  of interpretive  norms  and  by examining
their  relationship  with  Chevron.  Not  surprisingly,  the  answers  require
an  assessment  of the  interaction  between  the  original  constitutional
framework  and  governmental  structures  that  self-consciously  depart
from  that  framework.  Each  of the  norms  outlined  here  might  fall  in
more  than  one  category,  and  the judgment  about which  category  ap-
plies will  be  contestable.  The  particular judgments  are  less  important
than  the  general  conclusion  that  norms  that  serve  different  functions
will  interact  with  Chevron  in  different  ways.  I  order  the  norms  in  se-

quence, beginning with those that pose the strongest case for overcom-
ing  Chevron  and  ending  with  those  that  in  all  likelihood  should  be
defeated  by  agency interpretations.

C.  Syntactic Norms  and Interpretive Instructions

It  seems  clear  that  agency  interpretations  will  not  prevail  when
they  conflict  with  syntactic  norms.  Chevron  speaks  of "the  unambigu-
ously  expressed  intent  of  Congress"  as  the  basis  for  rejecting  an
agency's  view,  and  many  syntactic  principles  are  explicitly  designed  to
help  capture  legislative  instructions.  The  idea  that specific  terms  pre-
vail  over  general, 178  that  each  word  in  a  statute  will  be  construed  to
have  independent  meaning,' 79  and that words  will be  taken in  the con-
text of the  statute as  a  whole,' 80  are  part  of the process  of uncovering
"legislative  intent."1 8 1  These  norms  therefore  overcome  the  agency's
view,  at least if they  operate  reliably  in the case  at hand.  The Supreme
Court  has  indicated as  much in  so  many  words.' 8 2

The agency interpretation will also be  defeated  when Congress has
issued  interpretive  instructions.  When  explicit  instructions  appear  in
the statutory  text, they  should  prevail  over contrary agency  interpreta-
tions.  Interpretive  instructions  that  do  not appear  on  the  face  of the
statute, but that derive from the legislative history  or background  of the
statute,  or from understandings  about likely  legislative desires,  are  also
part  and parcel of the process  of discerning  Congress's  instructions  (its
"intent").  These  instructions  should  also  prevail  over  conflicting
agency  views.

The  question  is  somewhat  more difficult  when  the interpretive  in-
structions  are implicit  rather than  explicit-as,  for example,  in the no-
tion  that  appropriations  statutes  will  be  narrowly  construed,  or  that
statutes  will  be  construed  so as  to  be  valid  rather than  invalid. 18 3  The

ring  in the judgment).

Ct.  2166,  2173-74  (1989).

181.  There  is considerable  controversy,  inside  and outside of the Court,  about the
notion  of "legislative  intent."  In fact, this notion is  often an unhelpful  fiction,  treating a
collective  body  as  if it  had a unitary  idea  about how  to resolve  cases.  See,  for citations
and  discussion,  Sunstein,  supra  note 26, at 428-34.  For present purposes,  I use  terms
like  "meaning"  or  "instructions"  so  as  not  to call  up  this  controversial  question;  these
terms  should be seen  as synonymous  with  "intent" as that  idea is understood  in  Chevron.

unius canon).  The  view  that  the  expressio  unius principle  is  defeated  by  Chevron  seems
correct, since  that canon is  a questionable  one in light of the dubious  reliability of infer-
ring specific  intent from  silence.  See  id.  at 69.

problem  here  is  that  implicit  interpretive  instructions  are in  a  sense  a
judicial rather  than  a  legislative  creation-a  formulation  of legislative
will  that, while highly plausible,  has been  nowhere expressly  stated,  and
that  may  therefore  be  controversial.  As  the  interpretive  instructions
track legislative  desires  more  controversially,  they  come  closer  to  fall-
ing  into  the  category  of substantive  or institutional  principles,  which
provide  a weaker  case for  rejection  of Chevron.  But when  the principle
is  closely  traceable to a likely  congressional judgment,  it plainly  defeats
the Chevron  principle.  The  Court  has  so  indicated in  cases  before  and
after  Chevron. 184

D.  Norms that Require an Explicit Legislative Statement

The  discussion thus  far has  involved  norms  that are invoked  to un-
cover congressional  "intent."  The  remaining  categories  of norms  do
not involve  legislative  instructions  or "intent"  at all.  It is  plausible  to
suggest  that  these  norms  should  always  be  trumped  by  Chevron.  In
Chevron, after all,  the Court emphasized  that the agency's  view  will pre-
vail  unless  there  is  a  direct  congressional  judgment  to  the  contrary.
When  a court is  dealing with norms  that do not relate  to congressional
instructions,  it seems  reasonable  that  the agency's  view  should prevail.
On  this  account,  only  intent  and  intent-related  canons  can  defeat  the
agency's  view. 18 5

On  the other  hand,  Chevron  does  refer  to  and  endorse  the "tradi-
tional  tools  of statutory  construction." 18 6  This  point  has  frequently
been  emphasized  in  subsequent  cases. 18 7  Constitutionally  inspired
norms,  along  with  many  others  that  serve  institutional  or substantive
goals,  stand  as  part  of those  traditional  tools.  If the  traditional  tools
include  the substantive  norms,  then  these  norms  can  defeat  agency  in-
terpretations  consistently  with  Chevron.  In  many  cases,  powerful  argu-
ments  support  this  conclusion.

It will  be  useful  to begin  with norms  designed  to require  that stat-
utes  contain  an  explicit  statement  from  Congress.  "Clear  statement"
principles  are  omnipresent  in  current  law.  A subset  of the category  of
interpretive  norms,  they are designed  to  ensure an unambiguous  state-

gress.");  TVA  v.  Hill, 437  U.S.  153,  189-91  (1978)  (rejecting  agency  interpretation  in

ment from  Congress before allowing  certain results to be reached.  One
of their targets is  governmental  outcomes  that reflect views  that  can  be
traced only  to  the executive branch,  and  not to  the national legislature
as  well.  Principles  that  require  a  clear legislative  statement,  I  argue,
overcome  Chevron.

1.  Constitutionally Inspired Norms.  - Many  substantive  norms  have
constitutional  foundations.  Examples  include  the  principle  that  stat-
utes ordinarily will  be construed  to be valid rather than  invalid, to  steer
clear of serious  constitutional  doubts,  so as not to  intrude  on the tradi-
88  Principles  of this
tional power of the President or preempt state law. 1
sort  require  a  clear  statement  from  Congress  before  courts  will  inter-
pret  statutes  as  intruding  into  constitutionally  troublesome  areas.

If these  principles  cannot  be  understood  as  a  way  of discerning
legislative instructions,  and  if Congress  can  displace  them  with  a  clear
statement, how might they  be defended?  The process  of statutory  con-
struction  is  often  thought  to  be  a  means  of discerning  the  meaning  of
statutory  words,  and  here  substantive  principles  might  be  considered
irrelevant  or indeed  illegitimate.  By using  these  principles,  courts  de-
cide  cases  of statutory  meaning  by  reference  to  something  external  to
legislative  desires,  even  though  the  interpretation  in  question  would
not ordinarily  violate  the  Constitution.

There are,  however, at least three reasons  for the continued  use of
constitutionally  inspired  interpretive  principles.  First,  it  is  sometimes
impossible  to  decide  hard  cases  without resorting  to  these  principles.
Some  cases  are  genuinely  in  equipoise,  and  courts  (or agencies)  need
tie  breakers.  It is  hard  to  object  to  tie  breakers  that  are rooted  in con-
stitutionally  grounded  structural  principles.

Second,  some  principles  are justified as  an effort  to  ensure legisla-
tive rather  than  merely  administrative  deliberation  about  constitution-
ally  troublesome  issues. 18 9  This  idea  is  itself based  on  considerations
of constitutional  structure.  For example,  the Supreme  Court no longer
enforces  the nondelegation  doctrine with much vigor, and probably  for
good reasons.1 90  But in  the wake  of the downfall  of that  doctrine,  the
use of constitutionally  based clear  statement  principles  serves  as  a nar-

188.  See  supra  notes  168-170  and  accompanying  text.
189.  The point is  explicitly recognized,  in rejecting the Chevron principle in favor of
the principle  of state  autonomy,  in California State  Bd.  of Optometry  v.  FTC,  910 F.2d
976, 981-82  (D.C.  Cir.  1990).

190.  That "Congress  cannot delegate  legislative  power to  the President  is a princi-
ple  universally  recognized  as  vital  to  the  integrity  and  maintenance  of the  system  of
government  ordained  by the  Constitution."  Field  v.  Clark,  143  U.S.  649,  692  (1892).
The  Court has not struck down  a statute on nondelegation  grounds  since the  New Deal.
For a justification  of its  unwillingness  to  do  so,  see  Stewart,  Beyond  Delegation  Doc-
trine, 36  Am.  U.L.  Rev.  323,  328-29  (1987).  For some  opposing  views,  see Industrial
Union  Dep't  v.  American  Petroleum  Inst.,  448  U.S.  607,  673-75,  685-87  (1980)
(Rehnquist, J., concurring),  and sources  cited id.  at 687 n.6; J. Ely,  Democracy  and  Dis-
trust  131-34  (1980).

rower  and more targeted  means  of ensuring that Congress,  rather than
bureaucrats,  will  deliberate  on  questions  that  raise  serious  constitu-
tional  difficulties  or  intrude  into  constitutionally  sensitive  areas.

In this respect,  clear  statement principles  operate like  the nondele-
gation  doctrine.  Both have  roots in  article  I,  and  these  principles  can
be  understood  as  a  second-best  surrogate  for  that  doctrine-a  surro-
gate  that is responsive  to the intrusiveness  and unwieldiness  of a large-
scale judicial  revival  of the nondelegation  doctrine.  In Kent v. Du~les,19 1
for  example,  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  a  seemingly  open-ended
grant of authority  to  the President  to issue  and  deny passports  did not
include  the power  to  refuse  to  allow  Communists  to leave  the  country
because  of their political  commitments. 19 2  The  decision  should  be un-
derstood as  an effort  to  ensure  that the national legislature,  not simply
the  executive  branch,  has  deliberated  on  a  question  raising  difficult
constitutional questions relating to freedom  of expression  and the right
to travel.  This approach  therefore  responds  to the delegation  problem
that would  result from a  decision  to  allow  the executive  branch  to un-
dertake  constitutionally  troublesome  acts  pursuant  to  an  open-ended
delegation  of authority.

Third, clear  statement principles  help  to promote fidelity to consti-
tutional  norms  that,  while  having  a  solid  constitutional  pedigree,  are
judicially underenforced. 19 3  Because judicial  invalidation  of statutes  is
troublesome  in  a  constitutional  democracy,  courts  are  properly  reluc-
tant  to enforce  the Constitution  with  the vigor  that might  be  appropri-
ate  for institutions  having  a better  electoral  pedigree.  Since  the Court
"underenforces"  the Constitution,  certain  constitutional  norms  in fact
reach  beyond  the place  where  courts  have  vindicated  those  norms.  It
follows  that  an  aggressive judicial  role in  statutory  interpretation,  one
that removes statutes  from the terrain of constitutional  doubt, will  pro-
mote  greater  conformity  with  norms  that in fact  do have  constitutional
status.

When  constitutionally  based norms  conflict with  an agency's  inter-
pretation,  it  is  highly  probable  that  the  agency's  view  will  not prevail.
As we  have  seen,  the Supreme Court  has held  that a  statute apparently
conferring  broad  power  to  forbid Americans  from  leaving  the  country
would  not be  interpreted  to  allow  the  Secretary  of State  to  deny  pass-
ports  to  American  citizens  who  were  members  of  the  Communist

strained by  their institutional  role from fully enforcing  constitutional  norms).  The point
is reflected  in the  fact that the  Supreme  Court often  interprets constitutional  provisions
with  reference  to its  own limited  fact-finding  and  policy-making  competence.  See,  e.g.,
Bowers v.  Hardwick, 478 U.S.  186,  194-95  (1986);  City of Cleburne  v.  Cleburne  Living

party. 19 4  According  to  the  Court,  a  general  grant of authority  to  the
executive  branch  should  not allow  the  Secretary  of State  to  intrude  on
what might  be  a  constitutionally  protected  right to  travel.  If Congress
intends  to  authorize  this  result,  it must  express  its will  clearly.' 9 5  In-
deed,  in a large number of cases, many  of them  postdating Chevron,  the
Court has invoked  constitutionally  inspired principles  in  order to reject
agency interpretations  of law.' 9 6  The most  conspicuous  of these  prin-
ciples  is  the idea  that ambiguous  statutes  will be  construed  so as  not to
raise serious  constitutional  questions.

It is  thus  implausible  that, after Chevron,  agency interpretations  of
ambiguous  statutes  will  prevail  even  if the consequence  of those inter-
pretations  is  to  produce  invalidity  or  to  raise  serious  constitutional
doubts.  The very  reason for the interpretive principle  in favor of avoid-
ing invalidity  or serious  doubts is to ensure  explicit congressional authori-
zation  before  certain  results  may  be  reached.  As  the  Court  held  in
unambiguous  terms  in  DeBartolo Corp.  v.  Florida Gulf Coast Building &
Construction Trades Council,197  a statute should  not be interpreted to  con-
fer that  authority  simply  on  the  agency's  say-so.

Other  constitutionally  inspired  principles  will  produce  a  similar
tension with  Chevron.  For example,  the idea that judicial review  of ad-

194.  See Kent,  357  U.S.  at  130;  supra  notes  191-192  and  accompanying  text.
195.  In Kent  and  related  cases,  the  link  between  the  clear  statement  principle  and
the nondelegation  doctrine is  especially  conspicuous:  courts  demand  a clear  statement
from the  principal lawmaker and  do  not regard  a vague  or general  grant  of authority  as
genuine  democratic  authorization  for constitutionally  troublesome  decisions.

196.  See  DeBartolo  Corp.  v.  Florida  Gulf Coast Bldg.  & Constr. Trades  Council,
108  S. Ct.  1392,  1397  (1988)  (construing NLRA  narrowly  to avoid potential first amend-
ment  problem);  Industrial  Union  Dep't  v.  American  Petroleum  Inst.,  448  U.S.  607,
645-46  (1980)  (construing OSHA narrowly  so  as to avoid unconstitutional  delegation);
NLRB  v.  Catholic Bishop,  440 U.S.  490, 507  (1979)  (construing NLRA  narrowly  so as to
avoid violation  of free  exercise  clause).

But see  Massachusetts  v.  Secretary  of HHS,  899  F.2d  53,  59-64  (1st Cir.  1990)  (en
banc);  Planned Parenthood  Fed'n of Am. v.  Sullivan,  913 F.2d  1492,  1497-98  (10th Cir.
1990);  New  York v.  Sullivan,  889  F.2d  401,  407-10  (2d Cir.  1989),  cert.  granted  sub
nom.  Rust v.  Sullivan,  110  S. Ct. 2559  (1990),  in which  lower courts  have held that  the
Department  of Health  and  Human  Services  (HHS)  has  the  statutory  authority  to deny
funds  for clinics  that  counsel  pregnant  women  about  abortion  but  that do  not  actually
perform abortions.  Under the relevant statute, HHS must deny  funds to clinics  in which
"abortion  is  [used  as]  a  method  of family  planning."  42 U.S.C.  § 300a-6  (1988).  There
is  a  substantial question  about whether  those  cases  were  rightly  decided.  (The issue  is
currently  before the Supreme  Court in Rust.)  Serious  constitutional questions  would be
raised  by a congressional  effort  to prevent  clinics  from  speaking  to  patients  about  the
abortion alternative,  and  the  text of the  statute is  ambiguous.  In the  absence  of a clear
legislative statement,  it should probably  be interpreted  so as  to avoid the  constitutional
question.

197.  108  S. Ct. 1392  (1988).  The  Court noted  that it normally  would  defer  to the
agency,  but  "[a]nother  rule  of  statutory  construction  [is]  pertinent  here:  where  an
otherwise  acceptable  construction  of  a  statute  would  raise  serious  constitutional
problems,  the  Court will  construe  the  statute  to avoid  such  problems  unless  such  con-
struction is  plainly  contrary  to the  intent  of Congress."  Id.  at  1397.

ministrative  action will  be  presumed available 9 8  and  the principle  that
federal  statutes  will  not lightly  be  taken  to  preempt  state  law1 99  might
well  conflict with  agency  interpretations.

In these cases  too,  the Chevron principle  will probably be held  inap-
plicable.20 0  These  norms  are  in  significant  part  an  effort  to  promote
congressional-rather  than  executive or bureaucratic-  deliberation  on
certain  issues, and  to cabin  executive  officials by  calling for express  leg-
islative  authorization.  If constitutionally  inspired  interpretive  norms
are understood  in  this  way,  they  cannot  be  trumped  by  Chevron.  The
comparative  advantages  of the agencies  are  not at stake when  a consti-
tutional norm that argues in favor of legislative  deliberation  is involved;
indeed,  the  institutional  considerations  counsel  against  acceptance  of
the agency's  view.

2.  Nonconstitutional Norms  Designed  to  Require  a  Clear Congressional
Statement.  - A  number of norms  without  constitutional  status  are  also
designed  to  ensure  a  clear  congressional  statement  before  certain  re-
sults  might  be  reached.  By  limiting administrative  discretion  to  make
law,  these  interpretive  principles  also  act  as  surrogates  for, or  particu-
larized  versions  of, the nondelegation  doctrine.  This is  so even  though
the principles  cannot  be  linked  cleanly  to  a  constitutional  provision.

Principles  of this  sort  have  been  used  throughout  the  history  of
American  law.  They require  the legislature  to express  itself clearly if it
wants  to  depart from  ordinary understandings  about the  scope  and na-
ture  of regulatory  policy.  Though these  understandings  are  at best in-
directly  rooted in  the Constitution,  they draw considerable  weight from
history, usual practice,  and time-honored  notions of equity  and  comity.
They  require  general  legislative  authorization  for new  departures.

Examples  include  the principle  that appropriations  statutes  do not
amend  substantive statutes, 201  the presumption against retroactivity, 2 02
and  the idea  that laws  will  apply  only within  the territory  of the United
States. 203  Because  these  norms  also  are  designed  to  produce  a  clear

case  involving an  ambiguous statute governing  the obligations imposed  on states  due  to
acceptance  of federal funding.  See also  California  State  Bd.  of Optometry  v.  FTC,  910
F.2d  976,  981-82  (D.C.  Cir.  1990)  (invalidating  FTC rule  despite  Chevron  because  of

idea has some connection with  the  due process  and ex post facto  clauses, although  these
clauses  usually would  not  be violated  by  retroactive  application  of statutes.

statement  from  Congress,  they  probably  cannot  be  defeated  by  the
agency's  contrary  view.

To be  sure, the argument for  this  result is  weaker  than  in  the case
of constitutionally  inspired norms, and perhaps  some nonconstitutional
norms  can  be  defeated  by  an agency interpretation.  But  if the norm  is
an  effort  to require  a  clear  legislative  statement,  it  should  usually  pre-
vail.  For example, the idea  that statutes generally  will apply  only within
the  territory  of the United  States  is  an  attempt  to  conform  to  the rea-
sonable  expectations  of both  the  legislature  and  affected  persons.  It
also  performs  an  important  function  in  sorting  out  the  relations  be-
tween  domestic  law  and  that  of  other  nations.  An  administrative
agency  should not be permitted to  displace  a principle  designed  to  en-
sure  that if American law  is to apply  outside of American  borders, Con-
gress  must  say  so  explicitly.  Quite  similar  ideas  account  for  the
presumption  against retroactivity-a  straightforward  effort to  promote
reasonable  expectations-and  the  notion  that  appropriations  meas-
ures, usually assembled  quickly  and without much deliberation, will  not
be  taken  to  amend  substantive  statutes.  Since  these  norms  are  in-
tended  to require legislative  deliberation, Chevron should not overcome
them.

E.  Norms Designed to  Counteract Administrative or Governmental Bias

Some  interpretive  norms  are intended  to  respond  to  systemic  bi-
ases  in  governmental  processes  and  thus  to  promote  principles  of fair
dealing.  These norms  are not designed  merely to require  a clear state-
ment  from  Congress;  they  represent  a  quite  general  effort  to  resolve
ambiguities  in  a way  that  fairly  allocates  both burdens  and  benefits  in
governmental  processes.  The idea  that treaties  and  statutes  should  be
construed  generously  to  the  Indian  tribes  is  a  prominent  example. 20 4
This  principle  is  designed  to  require  a  clear  congressional  statement
before  allowing  a statute  to be  interpreted  unfavorably  to a  group  that
has  been  mistreated  in  the  past.  Similarly,  criminal  statutes  are  inter-
preted  favorably  to  criminal  defendants 20 5 and  to  require mens  rea.206
The  same  idea  accounts  for  the  notion  that  it  is  not  for  agencies  to

204.  See Montana  v.  Blackfeet  Tribe  of Indians,  471  U.S.  759,  766  (1985).  For  a
discussion  of how  ideas  of this  sort  might be justified,  see  Eskridge,  supra  note  31,  at

(1971);  United States v.  Nofziger, 878  F.2d 442,452  (D.C. Cir.  1989),  cert.  denied,  110
S.  Ct.  564  (1989).

statute, even absent mens rea  showing); United States v.  Dotterweich,  320 U.S. 277,  281
(1943)  (corporate agent  with  "responsible  relation  to a public  danger"  may be charged

decide  whether  statutes  impose  on  them  the duty  to act  at all. 20 7

It would  be  odd  to  suggest  that  these  principles  can  be  overcome
by  an  agency  interpretation.  Principles  of this  sort  are  self-conscious
efforts  to  counteract administrative  or governmental  bias,  by requiring
an express congressional judgment on the point before allowing certain
results  to  be reached.  These principles  should  not be  overridden  sim-
ply because  the agency  wants  them  to  be.

F.  Norms Designed to  Protect Legislative Processes

Some  norms  are  designed  to  protect  the legislative  process  by  in-
creasing  rationality  and  integrity  in  that  process.  In  this  category  be-
long  the  ideas  that  implied  repeals  are  disfavored;  that  exemptions
from  taxation  or  antitrust  will  be  narrowly  construed;  and  that appro-
priations  statutes  will  rarely  be  understood  to  amend  substantive
statutes. 208

There  is  a  legitimate  argument  that  Chevron  overcomes  norms  of
this  sort.  Through  these norms,  courts  attempt  to  coordinate  statutes
with one  another and  to promote  the  coherence  of statutory  law.  The
agency is  in  a superior  position  to perform  that  task.  Its expertise  and
experience  with  related  statutes  make  it better able  to  fit  statutes  with
one  another  or  to  coordinate  seemingly  inconsistent  enactments. 209
Norms  designed  to  promote  the  coherence  of statutory  law  probably
should counteract  the agency's  view  if, but  only  if, the purpose  of the
relevant norm  is  to  ensure  a  clear  congressional  statement  or  to  carry
out  likely  interpretive  instructions  from  the  legislature.  If the  norm
merely reflects  the  court's  own  view  about how  statutes  ought  to  be  fit
together, Chevron should  require  the agency's  position  to  prevail.  This
conclusion  is consistent  with the Chevron Court's  recognition  that in  the
aftermath  of the rise  of the administrative  state,  the role  of coordinat-
ing  and  making  sense  of  regulatory  enactments  falls  principally  on
agencies  rather  than judges.

G.  Norms Against Regulatory Irrationality

The  strongest  cases  for allowing  Chevron to  prevail  involve  norms

207.  See  Dunlop  v.  Bachowski,  421  U.S.  560,  574-76  (1975);  Public  Citizen  v.
NRC,  901  F.2d  147,  153-56  (D.C. Cir.  1990);  Natural  Resources  Defense  Council,  Inc.
v. Train, 545  F.2d 320, 327  (2d Cir.  1976);  cf. Ohio  v.  Department  of Interior,  880 F.2d
432, 447-48  (D.C.  Cir. 1989)  (invalidating regulations  embodying market-oriented  val-
uation of natural  resources).

208.  See supra  notes  167,  171,  173  and  accompanying  text.
209.  See supra  notes  90-91  and  accompanying  text.  The  environmental  area  is  a
conspicuous  example.  The  Clean  Air Act,  42  U.S.C.  §§  7401-7642  (1988),  includes  a
large number of awkwardly  related provisions,  and  the EPA  is uniquely  able  to  have  an
overview  of the  system  as  a  whole.  Moreover,  the  Clean  Air  Act  relates  to  the  Clean
Water Act,  33  U.S.C.  §§  1251-1387  (1988),  in important  ways,  with  regulation  of the
air,  for  example,  possibly  increasing  pollution  of  the  water.  The  EPA  is  in  a  special
position  to  take  account  of these  effects.

that are designed  to  counteract  absurd or unjust results.  The judgment
about what  approach  is  absurd  or unjust is  likely  to be  made  by  refer-
ence  to traditional legal  understandings.  At least in  general, a contrary
administrative judgment ought  to be  respected.  Indeed,  a decision  by
the  court  to  apply  its  own judgment  in  this  context  would,  in  effect,
substitute  a  judicial  for  an  administrative  determination  in  circum-
stances  in  which  Congress  has  delegated  policy-making  power  to  the
agency.

An  example of the  central  idea  here is  the  time-honored  view  that
general  language  ought not lightly  be taken  to require  irrational or ab-
surd  consequences. 2 10  General language  is  quite  frequently overinclu-
sive-in  the sense  that  it  has  unforeseen  but  perverse  applications-
and  courts  usually  will  not  interpret  the  statutory  text  to  apply  if  it
would  produce  absurdity  that  was  not  clearly  intended  by  Congress.
More  particular  versions  of this  idea,  with  some  support  in  the  cases,
are  that de  minimis  exceptions  will  be  permitted 21 1  and  that  the costs
and benefits  of regulation will usually  be  subject to some sort of weigh-
ing process. 2 12

In these  areas,  displacement  of ordinary  interpretive  norms  by  the
agency's  view  is highly  plausible.  The  agency's  specialized  fact-finding
capacity and  policy-making  competence  are  highly likely  to  be relevant
in resolving  any ambiguities.  Here  the court ought to be especially  cau-
tious  in  attributing irrationality  or  absurdity  to  the agency's  view.  It is
the agency that is  most likely  to be  in a good position  to know whether
the application,  taken  in  context of the statutory  scheme  as  a  whole,  is
in  fact  irrational  or  absurd.

It  follows  that,  while courts  have  held  that  de  minimis  exceptions
to regulatory statutes  are  usually permitted, agencies  should be  permit-
ted  to  decide  that  de  minimis  exceptions  should  not  be  allowed,  be-
cause  (for  example)  of  the  high  costs  of  inquiry  into  whether  a
particular  exception is  or is not de minimis. 21 3  Whether or not this is a
persuasive  argument,  the agency is  in  a better position  than  the courts
to  decide.  The  salutary  interpretive  principle  in  favor  of de  minimis

exceptions,  therefore,  ought  not  to  defeat  an  agency  construction  to
the  contrary.

For another  example,  there  may  be  a  question  of whether  courts
are  authorized  to  require a showing of "irreparable  injury"  and  to con-
duct  the  ordinary form  of balancing before  issuing an  injunction.  The
question  is  of considerable  importance  to  environmental  policy.  One
answer  to  this  question  can be  found in  the Supreme  Court's  interpre-
tive  principle  in  favor  of equitable  balancing. 2 14  Whether  or  not  this
principle  is justified,  it  should  be  defeasible  upon  a  showing  that  the
agency  disagrees.  The Court's  choice  of a background  rule  here is  not
realistically attributable  to Congress;  it represents  instead a  contestable
judgment  about  how  the  statute  is  best  implemented.  On  that  score,
the  agency's  contrary judgment  should  prevail.

In many  other cases,  the meaning  of a statute  turns  at least in part
on  the rationality  of one  or  another interpretation. 2 15  When  this  is so,
deference  is  due  to  the agency's  view,  unless  it is  inconsistent  with an
interpretive  norm  having  another  source,  or unless  the absurdity  or  ir-
rationality  is  so  palpable  as  to  be  something on  which reasonable  peo-
ple could not differ.  Significantly,  it would  follow that an agency should
be  permitted  to  depart  from the literal  meaning  of the  statute  in  cases
involving  issues  that  Congress  has  not  specifically  considered,  espe-
cially  when such  departures  plausibly  make  sense  of the statute in light
of Congress's  general  purposes. 21 6

This  idea  has  potentially  broad  consequences.  In  the  period  of
common  law  ordering, courts  often  departed  from  the literal  meaning
of statutes in  cases  in which literalism produced  absurdity  or irrational-
ity.  In  the modem period, similar  departures  should  also be  expected,
but  here  the  principal  agent  is  the  agency  rather  than  the  judiciary.
The  task  of softening rigid  statutes,  and  of adapting  them  to  unantici-

214.  See  Amoco  Prod.  Co.  v.  Village  of Gambell,  480  U.S.  531,  544-46  (1987);

Weinberger v.  Romero-Barcelo,  456 U.S.  305,  311-13,  320  (1982).

215.  See, e.g., Ameican Petroleum Inst.,  448 U.S. at 628-30  (rejecting one interpreta-
tion  in part  because  that  interpretation  would  require  huge  expenditures  by  regulated
industries  for  few  gains  in  terms  of  health  and  safety);  Natural  Resources  Defense
Council,  Inc. v.  EPA,  824  F.2d  at  1159 n.6  (same  under ambiguous  provision  of Clean
Air Act);  see also  EEOC v.  Commercial Office  Prods.  Co.,  108  S.  Ct. 1666,  1674  (1988)
(deferring  to agency  interpretation  in part  because  alternative  view would  lead  to  "ab-
surd  or futile  results").

Of course,  the  agency's  position must be assessed  for arbitrariness  under  § 706  of
the  APA,  see  supra  notes  152-155  and  accompanying  text,  and  for  reasonableness
under Chevron's step  two,  see  supra  notes  151-155  and  accompanying  text.

216.  As  suggested supra  note 89,  this idea  casts doubt on  the decision  in American
Mining Congress  v. EPA,  824 F.2d  1177,  1193 (D.C. Cir.  1987),  in which  the court relied
on  the  literal  meaning  of the word  "discarded"  to forbid  the  EPA  from  applying  solid
waste regulations  to materials held for recycling.  It is implausible  to think that Congress
considered  the  exceptionally  complex  issues  of policy  in American Mining Congress.  In
light  of the  complexities,  deference  was  due  to  an  agency  that  had  thought  long  and
hard about  the  problem.  See supra  note  149.

pated  or  changed  circumstances,  has  fallen  principally  to  nonjudicial
actors.

CONCLUSION

Many  disputes  in contemporary  public law involve  the relationship
between  original  constitutional  principles  and  a twentieth  century  gov-
ernmental  apparatus  that  was  created  in  self-conscious  rejection  of
those principles.  Chevron,  a kind of counter-Marbu  y  for the administra-
tive  state,  is  one  of many  efforts  at  synthesis.  Despite  its  seemingly
technical character,  the Chevron principle-in far more substantial ways
than  more  visible  decisions  of  the  1980s-has  altered  the  fabric  of
modern  public law,  influencing  an  enormous  range of substantive  out-
comes  in  the process.

In  these circumstances,  the controversy  over the principle is hardly
surprising.  Chevron has been  defended  as a  plausible reconstruction  of
legislative  instructions,  one  that  amounts  to  a  desirable  device  for  al-
lowing  the  will  of  democratically  controlled,  specialized  agencies  to
prevail  over that of unaccountable,  generalist judges.  In particular,  the
principle  might  serve  as  a  means  of  counteracting  characteristic
problems  in the regulatory process-including, above  all, the problems
posed  by  lack  of coordination,  changed  circumstances,  statutory rigid-
ity,  and complex systemic effects.  For the resolution  of these problems,
agencies  have  significant  advantages  over  courts.  On  the  other  hand,
Chevron  has  been  criticized  as  an  inaccurate  reading  of congressional
instructions  and as a  departure from the principle,  central  to the system
of checks  and  balances,  that  those  limited  by  law  ought  not  to  be  al-
lowed  to  decide  on  the meaning  of the  limitation.

Both  the  defenses  and  the  criticisms  have  force  in particular  con-
texts.  The  effort  to mediate  between  them  calls  for an  attempt  to  sort
out the relationship  between  the New Deal  reformation  and the princi-
ples  of institutional  authority  that  preceded  it.  More  narrowly,  it calls
for an assessment  of likely  congressional  instructions,  often undertaken
in  the  absence of clear  legislative  guidance  and  therefore  based  on  an
understanding  of relevant  institutional  capacities  and  biases.  I  have
suggested  that  the  Chevron  principle  does  not  apply  unless  Congress
has  given  law-interpreting  power  to  the  agency.  This  basic  principle,
calls  for  deference  to  an  agency's  determination  when  the agency  has
been  granted  the  basic  authority  to  implement  the  statute  through
rulemaking  or  adjudication. 
It  argues  against  deference  most
powerfully  when  there has  been no  grant of implementing power  at all,
but also when  an  agency has been granted but has  not exercised imple-
menting power, when it is deciding on its own jurisdiction, or when  it is
otherwise  likely  to have  a bias.

Whether  or  not  a  narrow  formulation  of the  Chevron  principle  is
desirable,  it is possible  to find a place  for the competing  considerations
by  exploring ,the relationship  between  that  principle  and  other  norms

of statutory  interpretation.  Indeed,  it  is  precisely  here  that  the  legal
system  will  resolve  many  of the  struggles  over  the  roles  of Congress,
agency,  and  court in  the  development  of federal  regulatory  law.

When the relevant  interpretive  norm  is  part of an effort  to  discern
legislative  instructions,  Chevron is uncontroversially  subordinate  to that
norm.  Harder  questions  arise in  cases  involving norms  that serve  sub-
stantive or institutional goals  not directly  connected  to  a congressional
judgment.  When these norms  are traceable  to constitutional  considera-
tions,  or  to  other  efforts  to  ensure  a  clear  congressional  statement
before  government  may go  forward  on a particular  matter, the  Chevron
principle  should  be  overcome.  And  when  the  norm  is  an  effort  to
counteract  some  form  of bias,  Chevron  should  be  inapplicable.  The
Chevron principle  should  prevail,  however,  when  the relevant  norm  re-
flects  an  effort  to  promote  rationality  in  regulation  and  when  it  is  in-
tended  to ensure  coherence  and integrity  in the administrative process.
Here  deference  to  the agency  is  especially  important.

The meaning of a statute  can usually  be discerned  without the  ben-
efit  of interpretive  principles  of the  sort  that  I have  discussed  here.2 17
But cases  of ambiguity are  frequent, and it is in these cases  that Chevron
and  other  interpretive  principles  are  called  into  play.  By developing  a
clear  view  of the  relationship  among  those  principles,  we  might  ulti-
mately  be  able  to  reconcile  Chevron,  even  in  its  broader  formulations,
with  approaches  to  statutory  interpretation  that  help  to  discipline  the
administrative  state  through legal  constraints  on  the exercise  of public
power.  A  reconciliation  of this  sort would  count  as  one  among  a wide
range  of steps  designed  to  adapt  a  legal  system  founded  on  common
law  principles  to  the  aspirations  and  pathologies  of the  administrative
state.
