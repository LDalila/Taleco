      <p>For far too long, American debates about regulatory policy
have been caught between two unproductive poles. On the one
side are the defenders of regulatory policies characteristic of
the early 1970s-favoring a kind of absolutism with respect to
safety, skeptical about tradeoffs, dismissive of claims made by
"business." On the other side are the "consumer sovereignty"
voices of the early 1980s, claiming that consumers generally
"know best," and that market arrangements are sufficient for
purposes of promoting citizen welfare. The debate between the
two sides often seems blocked, not least in Congress, which has
had an extremely difficult time in directing agencies to pursue
any particular course and which often shuttles back and forth
between absolutism and an open-ended plea for "balancing."'</p>
      <p>The problem with the absolutist regulatory approach should
be obvious: it makes no sense to spend a great deal of money
when the benefits of expenditures are very low, especially in
light of the fact that regulatory expenditures are often borne
not by "business," but by employees and consumers. But there
are problems with the ideal of "consumer sovereignty" as well.
Frequently consumers lack relevant information, and even
when they have the facts, they may display bounded
rationality. 2 In any case, the American tradition is one of

This essay draws on a more detailed discussion found in Cass R. Sunstein, Cognition
and Cost-Benefit Analysis, 29 J. LEGAL STUD. (forthcoming 2000). This essay is a revised
version of oral remarks presented at the Federalist Society Eighteenth Annual Student
Symposium at The University of Chicago Law School on April 9-10,1999.</p>
      <p>1. I explore the evolution of this debate in CASS R. SUNSTEIN, Congress, Constitutional
Moments, andthe Cost-BenefitState, inFREE MARKETS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE 348-83 (1997).</p>

REV. 1471, 1477 (1998) ("Bounded rationality ...refers to the obvious fact that human
cognitive abilities are not infinite. We have limited computational skills and seriously
popular sovereignty, not "consumer sovereignty." Despite its
appeal in some contexts, the latter ideal is a distortion, almost a
parody, of founding ideals, and it involves deliberative
selfgovernment, not consumer choices.3</p>
      <p>In this essay I suggest that the debate over regulatory policy
is most sensibly treated as a debate over the nature of
costbenefit analysis. We should be able to make a great deal of
progress if we shift from the contested and often implausible
idea of consumer sovereignty and agree that some form of
costbenefit analysis is the appropriate basis for regulatory policy.
We may accept this proposition without necessarily agreeing
with the most controversial economic claims about the nature
of valuation or "willingness to pay." The best argument for
cost-benefit analysis is offered not on the ground that
government should be seen as a kind of machine for
aggregating private preferences, but with the thought that
some form of cost-benefit balancing is both inevitable and
desirable. It is possible to debate how relevant values should be
quantified, and I offer some brief suggestions on that topic
here. My basic submission, for present purposes, is only that a
great deal of progress can come from a shift away from the
deep theoretical waters to more confined debates about
hownot whether-to undertake cost-benefit balancing.</p>

      <title>I. INCOMPLETE THEORIZATION</title>
      <p>Often it is possible to resolve hard questions of law and
policy without resolving deeply contested issues about justice,
democracy, or the appropriate aims of the state. 4 Often it is
possible to obtain an incompletely theorized agreement on a
social practice and even on the social or legal specification of
the practice. In many areas of law and public policy, people can
reach closure about what to do despite their disagreement or
flawed memories."). This notion originates in Herbert A. Simon, A BehavioralModel of
RationalChoice, 69 Q.J. ECON. 99, 99-101 (1955).</p>

THE MILD VOICE OF REASON: DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY AND AMERICAN NATIONAL
GOVERNMENT (1994) (arguing that the Framers sought to produce a system of
republican self-government partly because of a judgment that political deliberation can
be best promoted through a representative system).</p>

(1996); CASS R. SUNSTEIN, ONE CASE AT A TIME (1999).
No. 1] From ConsumerSovereignty to Cost-Benefit Analysis
uncertainty about why, exactly, they ought to do it. Whether
they are utilitarians or retributivists, people who disagree
about the purposes of the criminal law can agree that rape and
murder should be punished and punished more severely than
theft and trespass. People can support an Endangered Species
Act amidst disagreement about whether the protection of
endangered species is desirable for theological reasons, or
because of the rights of animals, plants, and species, or because
of the value of animals, plants, and species for human beings.
A great advantage of incompletely theorized agreements is that
they allow people of diverse views to live together on mutually
advantageous terms. A greater advantage is that they allow
people of diverse views to show one another a high degree of
both humility and mutual respect.</p>
      <p>I believe that an incompletely theorized agreement is
possible here; at least achieving such an agreement should be
the goal of those attempting to improve the operation of the
system of regulatory protection and to understand the uses of
cost-benefit analysis in regulatory policy. To be sure, it would
be difficult to obtain agreement on the view (which seems
implausible to me) that all questions of regulatory policy
should be resolved by asking how much people are willing to
pay for various social goods. Often people lack important
information; sometimes they are quasi-rational.5 There is also a
difference between the judgments people make as consumers
and those that they make as citizens, and sometimes the latter
deserve to prevail. 6</p>
      <p>But my basic claims here are (1) that whatever their
theoretical disagreements, it should be possible for diverse,
reasonable people to agree on presumptive floors and ceilings
for regulatory expenditures and (2) that the presumptions can
do a great deal of useful work for policymaking and for law. In
short, a great deal can be done without confronting the hardest
theoretical questions raised by contentious specifications of
cost-benefit analysis.</p>
      <p>5. See generallyRICHARD H. THALER, QUASI-RATIONAL ECONOMICS (1991). The term
"quasi-rational" refers to the fact that people's actual behavior departs from that of the
"rational actor" posited by many economic models.</p>
      <p>6. See SUNSTEIN, supranote 1, at 13-69.</p>
      <p>An obvious question here is: Who could join this
incompletely theorized agreement? My principal claim is that
the agreement can be joined by most of those who accept and
those who doubt the idea that private willingness to pay is the
appropriate foundation for regulatory policy. Thus, there is
room here for deliberative democrats who emphasize the need
for government to reflect on private preferences, rather than
simply to translate them into law.7 A prime purpose of the
approach is to ensure more in the way of reflection; cost-benefit
analysis, as understood here, is a guarantee of greater
deliberation, not an obstacle to it. Nor is the approach rigid.
Under the proposed approach, agencies have the authority to
abandon the floors and ceilings if there is reason for them to do
so. If, for example, agencies want to spend a great deal to
protect African-American children from a risk
disproportionately faced by them, they are entitled to do so, as
long as they explain that this is what they are doing.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>II. EIGHT PROPOSITIONS</title>
      <p>Here, then, are eight brief propositions, offered in the hope
that they might attract support from diverse theoretical
standpoints. I offer these as a tentative starting point for the
effort to anchor cost-benefit analysis in an incompletely
theorized agreement about regulatory policies. 8</p>
      <p>1. Agencies should identify the advantagesand disadvantagesof
proposedcourses ofaction and also attempt to quantify the relevant
effects to the extent that this is possible. When quantification is not
possible, agencies should discuss the relevant effects in
qualitative terms and also specify a range of plausible
outcomes (e.g., annual savings of between 150 and 300 lives or
savings of between $100 million and $300 million, depending
on the rate of technological change). The very decision to
specify effects should improve the decisionmaking process and
also make the democratic process work better by giving the
public a sense of the stakes.</p>
      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>2. The quantitativedescriptionshould supplement ratherthan</title>
        <p>displacea qualitativedescriptionof relevanteffects. Both
qualitative and quantitative analyses should be provided. The
qualitative description should give a concrete sense of who is
helped and who is hurt-for example, whether the regulation
will lead to lost jobs, higher prices, more poverty, and so forth.
Where the only possible information is speculative, this should
be noted, along with the most reasonable speculations. Here,
too, the goal is to improve the democratic process by giving
people, in government and outside of it, a chance to
understand the likely effects of regulation and nonregulation.</p>
        <p>3. Agencies should attempt to convert nonmonetary values
(including,for example, lives saved, healthgains, and aesthetic
values) into dollarequivalents. This point does not suggest that a
statistical life and $5 million, for example, are the same thing,
but it aims to promote coherence and uniformity and to ensure
the sensible setting of priorities. There is nothing magical or
rigid about any particular dollar equivalents; the conversion is
simply a pragmatic tool to guide analysis and to allow
informed comparisons. Economists have attempted to estimate
the amount that people are "willing to pay" to save a statistical
life, with a range of between $3 million and $10 million.9 These
studies are controversial, but at least they provide a start. In
addition, the same range of numbers seems to be the median
on the government's cost-per-life-saved charts.10</p>
        <p>If $5 million seems too high, or too low, the question should
be the following: on what basis might an alternative number be
chosen? Note here that any monetary values are intended as
presumptive, not conclusive (see proposition 5 below).</p>
        <p>9. See W. KIP Viscusi, FATAL TRADEOFFS: PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR
RISK 34-74 (1992); W. Kip Viscusi, Regulating the Regulators, 63 U. CHI. L. REV. 1423,
1430-36 (1996).</p>
        <p>
          10. See STEPHEN BREYER, BREAKING THE Vicious CIRcLE: TOWARD EFFECTIVE RISK
REGULATION 24-2
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">7 (1993</xref>
          ).
4. Agencies entrustedwith valuing life andhealth should be
controlled,by statuteorExecutive order,via presumptivefloors and
ceilings. For example, a statute might say that a statistical life
will ordinarily be valued at no less than $2 million and no more
than $10 million. Evidence of worker and consumer behavior,
suggesting a valuation of between $5 million and $7 million per
statistical life saved, is relevant here. The Office of
Management and Budget should move in the direction of
establishing presumptive floors and ceilings for various
regulatory benefits. If an agency is going to spend, for example,
no more than $500,000 per life saved, or more than $20 million,
it should have to explain its decision.
        </p>
        <p>5. Agencies should be permittedto adjust the ceilings andfloors,
or to choose a low or high end ofthe range,on the basisof a publicly
articulatedandreasonablejudgment that such an adjustment or such
a choice is desirable. To avoid unnecessary controversy, and
what would reasonably be seen as injustice, there should be no
adjustments downwards for poor people. In other words, the
fact that poor people are willing to spend less to protect their
own lives (because they are poor) should not call for a
correspondingly lower expenditure by the government.</p>
        <p>6. Agencies should bepermitted to make adjustments on the basis
ofa reasonableassessment ofvariousqualitativefactors,such as
whether the risk is faced voluntarily, is controllable, is dreaded, is
potentially catastrophic,and is equitably distributed." For example,
they might add a pain and suffering annual premium or
increase the level of expenditure because children are
disproportionately affected or because the victims are members
of a disadvantaged group. To the extent possible, they should

HOWARD MARGOLIS, DEALING wITH RISK (1996); Paul Slovic et al., Regulation ofRisk: A
PsychologicalPerspective,in REGULATORY POLICY AND ThE SOCIAL SCIENCES 241 (Roger
G. Noll, ed., 1985). See also Robin Gregory &amp; Robert Mendelsohn, PerceivedRisk, Dread
and Benefits, 13 RISK ANALYSIS 259 (1993) (using regression techniques to identify the
major explanatory variables for lay people's risk perceptions and finding, among other
things that people care about whether the risk has immediate or latent effects, whether
it will affect future generations, and whether its effects are catastrophic or diffuse).
be precise about the nature of, and grounds for, the relevant
adjustments.</p>
        <p>7. The appropriateresponseto excessive socialfearsnot based on
evidence and to relatedripple effects, is education andreassurance
rather than increased regulation. Sometimes public concern
about certain risks is general and intense, even though the
concern is not merited by the facts.12 The best response is
educational, but if education and reassurance fail, increased
regulation may be defensible as a way of providing a kind of
reassurance.</p>
        <p>8. Unless the statuterequiresotherwise,judicialreview ofrisk
regulationshould requirea generalshowing that regulationhas
producedmore good than harm on a reasonableview about valuation
of both benefits and costs. On this view, courts should generally
require agencies to generate and to adhere to ceilings and
floors, but they should also allow agencies to depart from
conventional numbers (by, for example, valuing a life at less
than $1 million or more than $10 million) if and only if the
agency has given a reasonable explanation of why it has done
SO.</p>

      <title>III. CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>For the last thirty years, debates over regulatory policy, and
protection of consumers, have been blocked unnecessarily by
intransigence, sloganeering, and conflict. "Absolutism" makes
no sense; the question is always what will be gained and what
will be lost (though of course we might disagree about how to
answer that question). The idea of "consumer sovereignty" is
too contestable and too vulnerable to be challenged by those
who stress limited information, bounded rationality, and the
difference between the decisions people make as citizens and
those they make as consumers.</p>
      <p>1M See Timur Kuran &amp; Cass R. Sunstein, Availability CascadesandRisk Regulation, 51
STAN. L. REV. 683, 691-703 (1999) (discussing examples of widespread and intense, but
ultimately unwarranted, public concern over events such as Love Canal and the use of
the pesticide Alar on apples).</p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>HarvardJournalofLaw &amp;PublicPolicy</title>
        <p>I have suggested that it should ultimately be possible, first, to
obtain an incompletely theorized agreement on the need for
cost-benefit analysis and, second, to obtain incompletely
theorized agreements on certain understandings of what
costbenefit analysis entails. I have briefly suggested the possible
nature of such understandings. Perhaps some of the eight
propositions are wrong or misdirected; perhaps some of them
ignore relevant arguments. The task for the future is not to
press implausible arguments about consumer sovereignty but
to see how cost-benefit analysis might be refined so as to
attract, and to deserve, broad support.</p>
