      <p>A Behavioral Approach to Law and</p>
      <p>Economics</p>
      <p>Economic analysis of law usually proceeds under the assumptions of
neoclassical economics. But empirical evidence gives much reason to doubt these
assumptions; people exhibit bounded rationality, bounded self-interest, and
bounded willpower. This article offers a broad vision of how law and
economics analysis may be improved by increased attention to insights about actual
human behavior. It considers specific topics in the economic analysis of law
and proposes new models and approaches for addressing these topics. The
analysis of the article is organized into three categories: positive, prescriptive,
and normative. Positive analysis of law concerns how agents behave in
response to legal rules and how legal rules are shaped. Prescriptive analysis
concerns what rules should be adopted to advance specified ends. Normative
analysis attempts to assess more broadly the ends of the legal system: Should
the system always respect people’s choices? By drawing attention to cognitive
and motivational problems of both citizens and government, behavioral law and
economics offers answers distinct from those offered by the standard analysis.

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
        <p>Objections to the rational actor model in law and economics are almost
as old as the field itself. Early skeptics about the economic analysis of law
were quick to marshal arguments from psychology and other social sciences
to undermine its claims.1 But in law, challenges to the rational actor
assumption by those who sympathize with the basic objectives of economic
analysis have been much less common. The absence of sustained and
comprehensive economic analysis of legal rules from a perspective informed by
insights about actual human behavior makes for a significant contrast with
many other fields of economics, where such “behavioral” analysis has
become relatively common.2 This is especially odd since law is a domain
where behavioral analysis would appear to be particularly promising in light
of the fact that nonmarket behavior is frequently involved.</p>
        <p>Our goal in this article is to advance an approach to the economic
analysis of law that is informed by a more accurate conception of choice, one that
reflects a better understanding of human behavior and its wellsprings. We
build on and attempt to generalize earlier work in law outlining behavioral
findings by taking the two logical next steps: proposing a systematic
framework for a behavioral approach to economic analysis of law, and using
behavioral insights to develop specific models and approaches addressing
topics of abiding interest in law and economics.3 The analysis of these specific
topics is preliminary and often in the nature of a proposal for a research
agenda; we touch on a wide range of issues in an effort to show the potential
uses of behavioral insights. The unifying idea in our analysis is that
behavioral economics allows us to model and predict behavior relevant to law with
the tools of traditional economic analysis, but with more accurate
assumptions about human behavior, and more accurate predictions and prescriptions
about law. Certainly a great deal of work would be necessary to justify a
final evaluation of most of the topics pursued here; there is fertile ground for
future research, both theoretical and empirical, and one of our principal goals
is to suggest the directions in which that research might go.</p>
        <p>We suggest that an approach based on behavioral economics will help
with the three functions of any proposed approach to law: positive,
prescriptive, and normative.4 The positive task, perhaps most central to economic
analysis of law and our principal emphasis here, is to explain both the effects
and content of law. How will law affect human behavior? What will
individuals’ likely response to changes in the rules be? Why does law take the
form that it does? A superior understanding of human behavior will improve
answers to such questions.</p>
        <p>The prescriptive task is to see how law might be used to achieve
specified ends, such as deterring socially undesirable behavior. Much of
conventional economic analysis is concerned with this sort of question. Explicit
consideration of behavioral factors can improve the prescriptions offered by
the analyst. For instance, instead of focusing only on the actual probability
of detecting criminal behavior in considering whether offenders will be
deterred, the analyst might also want to consider the perceived probability of
detection and how it might differ in systematic and predictable ways from
the actual probability.</p>
        <p>The normative task is to assess more broadly the ends of the legal
system. In conventional economic analysis, normative analysis is no different
from prescriptive analysis, since the goal of the legal system is to maximize
3. The existing legal literature includes several articles that generally catalogue behavioral
findings and suggest legal issues to which these findings might be relevant. See Ward Edwards &amp;
Detlof von Winterfeldt, Cognitive Illusions and Their Implications for the Law, 59 S. CAL. L. REV.
225 (1986); Melvin Aron Eisenberg, The Limits of Cognition and the Limits of Contract, 47 STAN.
L. REV. 211 (1995); Robert C. Ellickson, Bringing Culture and Human Frailty to Rational Actors:
A Critique of Classical Law and Economics, 65 CHI.-KENT L. REV. 23 (1989); Cass R. Sunstein,
Behavioral Analysis of Law, 64 U. CHI. L. REV. 1175 (1997). The existing literature also includes a
number of articles that use behavioral insights to analyze specific topics in the economic analysis of
law—primarily the Coase theorem and behavior during bargaining. These articles are relevant to a
few of the issues we discuss below, and we will draw on them in analyzing those issues.</p>
        <p>4. For a similar distinction between positive, prescriptive, and normative analysis, see David
E. Bell, Howard Raiffa &amp; Amos Tversky, Descriptive, Normative, and Prescriptive Interactions in
Decision Making, in DECISION MAKING 9 (David E. Bell, Howard Raiffa &amp; Amos Tversky eds.,
1988); Sunstein, supra note 3.
“social welfare,” usually measured by people’s revealed preferences, and
prescriptive (in our sense of the term) analysis also focuses, for the
conventional economist, on how to maximize social welfare. But from the
perspective of behavioral economics, the ends of the legal system are more complex.
This is so because people’s revealed preferences are a less certain ground on
which to build; obviously issues of paternalism become central here.</p>
        <p>Each of these three strands of our project is deeply constructive.
Behavioral economics is a form of economics, and our goal is to strengthen the
predictive and analytic power of law and economics, not to undermine it.
Behavioral economics does not suggest that behavior is random or
impossible to predict; rather it suggests, with economics, that behavior is systematic
and can be modeled. We attempt to sketch several such models here.</p>
        <p>Part I below offers a general framework and provides an overview of the
arguments for enriching the traditional economic framework. We see this
enrichment as similar in spirit to the increased emphasis on asymmetric
information in mainstream economic analysis in recent decades. Just as people
often have imperfect information, which has predictable consequences for
behavior, the departures from the standard conception of the economic agent
also alter behavior in predictable ways.</p>
        <p>Parts II and III of the article involve positive analysis. Part II examines
how a behaviorally-informed law and economics analysis can help to explain
the behavior of human agents insofar as that behavior is relevant to law. Our
topics here include bargaining behavior and the effects of mandatory contract
terms. Part III shifts to an explanation of existing legal rules and institutions.
We suggest that many features of the legal landscape that are puzzling from a
traditional law and economics perspective follow naturally from behavioral
phenomena.</p>
        <p>Part IV of the article examines prescriptive issues, offering a series of
proposals that might seem surprising or controversial from a neoclassical
economic perspective but that follow naturally from taking into account
features of actual choice behavior. Our principal emphasis is on how people
respond to information and how this point bears on the role of law.</p>
        <p>Part V is more speculative and normative. We briefly outline the main
problems—some familiar and others less so—with the idea that the legal
system ought always to respect informed choice, and also with the idea that
government decisionmakers—who after all are behavioral actors too—can be
relied upon to make better choices than citizens. Because of the complexity
of these issues, we emphasize three broad points: the framework that
behavioral economics suggests for thinking about issues of paternalism; the
possibility that some institutions—such as populist government—may be
particularly bad at attempted correction of citizen error, while others may be
better; and the prospect that some methods of correction (such as those that
focus on debiasing rather than outright coercion) may be acceptable even if
one thinks that citizen error is relatively unlikely.</p>
        <p>I. FOUNDATIONS: WHAT IS “BEHAVIORAL LAW AND ECONOMICS”?
In order to identify, in a general way, the defining features of behavioral
law and economics, it is useful first to understand the defining features of
law and economics. As we understand it, this approach to the law posits that
legal rules are best analyzed and understood in light of standard economic
principles. Gary Becker offers a typical account of those principles: “[A]ll
human behavior can be viewed as involving participants who [1] maximize
their utility [2] from a stable set of preferences and [3] accumulate an
optimal amount of information and other inputs in a variety of markets.”5 The
task of law and economics is to determine the implications of such rational
maximizing behavior in and out of markets, and its legal implications for
markets and other institutions. Although some of Becker’s particular
applications of the economic approach might be thought of as contentious, that
general approach underlies a wide range of work in the economic analysis of
law.6</p>
        <p>What then is the task of behavioral law and economics? How does it
differ from standard law and economics? These are the questions we address
below.</p>

      <title>A. Homo Economicus and Real People</title>
      <p>The task of behavioral law and economics, simply stated, is to explore
the implications of actual (not hypothesized) human behavior for the law.
How do “real people” differ from homo economicus? We will describe the
differences by stressing three important “bounds” on human behavior,
bounds that draw into question the central ideas of utility maximization,
stable preferences, rational expectations, and optimal processing of
information.7 People can be said to display bounded rationality, bounded willpower,
and bounded self-interest.</p>
      <p>All three bounds are well documented in the literature of other social
sciences, but they are relatively unexplored in economics (although, as we
noted at the outset, this has begun to change). Each of these bounds
represents a significant way in which most people depart from the standard

ed. 1989); RICHARD A. POSNER, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF LAW 3-4 (5th ed. 1998).</p>
      <p>7. For a further elaboration of this view, see Richard H. Thaler, Doing Economics Without

nomic model. While there are instances in which more than one bound
comes into play, at this stage we think it is best to conceive of them as
separate modeling problems. Nonetheless, each of the three bounds points to
systematic (rather than random or arbitrary) departures from conventional
economic models, and thus each of the three bears on generating sound
predictions and prescriptions for law. They also provide the foundations for
new and sometimes quite formal models of behavior.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>1. Bounded rationality.</title>
      <p>Bounded rationality, an idea first introduced by Herbert Simon, refers to
the obvious fact that human cognitive abilities are not infinite.8 We have
limited computational skills and seriously flawed memories. People can
respond sensibly to these failings; thus it might be said that people sometimes
respond rationally to their own cognitive limitations, minimizing the sum of
decision costs and error costs. To deal with limited memories we make lists.
To deal with limited brain power and time we use mental shortcuts and rules
of thumb. But even with these remedies, and in some cases because of these
remedies, human behavior differs in systematic ways from that predicted by
the standard economic model of unbounded rationality. Even when the use
of mental shortcuts is rational, it can produce predictable mistakes. The
departures from the standard model can be divided into two categories:
judgment and decisionmaking. Actual judgments show systematic departures
from models of unbiased forecasts, and actual decisions often violate the
axioms of expected utility theory.</p>
      <p>A major source of differences between actual judgments and unbiased
forecasts is the use of rules of thumb. As stressed in the pathbreaking work
of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, rules of thumb such as the
availability heuristic—in which the frequency of some event is estimated by
judging how easy it is to recall other instances of this type (how “available”
such instances are)—lead us to erroneous conclusions. People tend to
conclude, for example, that the probability of an event (such as a car accident) is
greater if they have recently witnessed an occurrence of that event than if
they have not.9 What is especially important in the work of Kahneman and
Tversky is that it shows that shortcuts and rules of thumb are predictable.
While the heuristics are useful on average (which explains how they become
adopted), they lead to errors in particular circumstances. This means that
someone using such a rule of thumb may be behaving rationally in the sense
of economizing on thinking time, but such a person will nonetheless make
forecasts that are different from those that emerge from the standard
rationalchoice model.10</p>
      <p>Just as unbiased forecasting is not a good description of actual human
behavior, expected utility theory is not a good description of actual
decisionmaking. While the axioms of expected utility theory characterize
rational choice, actual choices diverge in important ways from this model, as
has been known since the early experiments by Allais and Ellsberg.11 There
has been an explosion of research in recent years trying to develop better
formal models of actual decisionmaking. The model offered by Kahneman
and Tversky, called prospect theory, seems to do a good job of explaining
many features of observed behavior, and so we draw on that model (whose
main features we summarize in Part IV.B below) here.12</p>
      <p>We emphasize that bounded rationality is entirely consistent with
modeling behavior and generating predictions based on a model, in line with the
methodology of conventional economics. As Kenneth Arrow has explained,
“[T]here is no general principle that prevents the creation of an economic
theory based on other hypotheses than that of rationality. . . . [A]ny coherent
theory of reactions to the stimuli appropriate in an economic
context . . . could in principle lead to a theory of the economy.”13 Arrow’s
example here is habit formation; that behavior, he says, can be incorporated
into a theory by supposing that people choose goods with an eye towards
minimizing changes in their consumption.</p>
      <p>Though there is an optimization in this theory, it is different from utility
maximization; for example, if prices and income return to their initial levels after
several alterations, the final bundle [of goods] purchased will not be the same as
the initial [bundle]. This theory would strike many lay observers as plausible,
yet it is not rational as economists have used that term.14</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>2. Bounded willpower.</title>
      <p>In addition to bounded rationality, people often display bounded
willpower. This term refers to the fact that human beings often take actions that
they know to be in conflict with their own long-term interests. Most smokers
say they would prefer not to smoke, and many pay money to join a program
or obtain a drug that will help them quit. As with bounded rationality, many
people recognize that they have bounded willpower and take steps to
mitigate its effects. They join a pension plan or “Christmas Club” (a special
savings arrangement under which funds can be withdrawn only around the
holidays) to prevent undersaving, and they don’t keep tempting desserts
around the house when trying to diet. In some cases they may vote for or
support governmental policies, such as social security, to eliminate any
temptation to succumb to the desire for immediate rewards.15 Thus, the
demand for and supply of law may reflect people’s understanding of their own
(or others’) bounded willpower; consider “cooling off” periods for certain
sales and programs that facilitate or even require saving.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>3. Bounded self-interest.</title>
      <p>Finally, we use the term bounded self-interest to refer to an important
fact about the utility function of most people: They care, or act as if they
care, about others, even strangers, in some circumstances. (Thus, we are not
questioning here the idea of utility maximization, but rather the common
assumptions about what that entails.) Our notion is distinct from simple
altruism, which conventional economics has emphasized in areas such as bequest
decisions.16 Self-interest is bounded in a much broader range of settings than
conventional economics assumes, and the bound operates in ways different
from what the conventional understanding suggests. In many market and
bargaining settings (as opposed to nonmarket settings such as bequest
decisions), people care about being treated fairly and want to treat others fairly if
those others are themselves behaving fairly. As a result of these concerns,
the agents in a behavioral economic model are both nicer and (when they are
not treated fairly) more spiteful than the agents postulated by neoclassical
theory. Formal models have been used to show how people deal with both
fairness and unfairness; we will draw on those models here.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>4. Applications.</title>
      <p>The goal of this article is to show how the incorporation of these
understandings of human behavior bears on the actual operation and possible
improvement of the legal system. The appendix summarizes some key features
of each of the three bounds on human behavior just described. It also
indicates the law and economics issues we analyze under each category.</p>
      <p>When is each bound likely to come into play? Any general statement
will necessarily be incomplete, but some broad generalizations can be
offered. First, bounded rationality as it relates to judgment behavior will come
into play whenever actors in the legal system are called upon to assess the
probability of an uncertain event. We discuss many examples below,
including environmental legislation (Part III.C), negligence determinations
(Part IV.A), and risk assessments (Parts IV.B and V.A.). Second, bounded
rationality as it relates to decisionmaking behavior will come into play
whenever actors are valuing outcomes; a prominent example here is loss
aversion and its corollary, the endowment effect, which we discuss in
connection with bargaining behavior (Part II.B), mandatory contract terms (Part
II.D), prior restraints on speech (Part III.B), and risk assessments (Part IV.B).
Bounded willpower is most relevant when decisions have consequences over
time; our example is criminal behavior (Part IV.C), where the benefits are
generally immediate and the costs deferred. Finally, bounded self-interest
(as we use the term) is relevant primarily in situations in which one party has
deviated substantially from the usual or ordinary conduct under the
circumstances; in such circumstances the other party will often be willing to incur
financial costs to punish the “unfair” behavior. Our applications here include
bargaining behavior (Part II.B) and laws banning market transactions (Part
III.A).</p>
      <p>The three bounds we describe do not (at least as we characterize them
here) constitute a full description of human behavior in all its complexity.
Although we will have more to say about parsimony below, we will say for
now that our goal is to sketch out an approach spare enough to generate
predictions across a range of contexts, but not so spare that its predictions about
behavior are often incorrect (as we will suggest is the case with conventional
law and economics in some contexts). Many interesting features of behavior
discussed by psychologists but not emphasized by our framework may also
play a role in explaining specific forms of behavior relevant to law.17 And it
can be illuminating to attend in some detail to the role of social norms in
17. See, e.g., Russell Korobkin &amp; Chris Guthrie, Psychological Barriers to Litigation
Settlement: An Experimental Approach, 93 MICH. L. REV. 107 (1994) (finding effects of “equity
seeking” and “reactive devaluation” on settlement behavior); Mark Kelman, Yuval Rottenstreich &amp;
Amos Tversky, Context-Dependence in Legal Decision Making, 25 J. LEGAL STUD. 287 (1996)
(describing effects of “compromise” and “contrast” behavior on jury decisionmaking).
various contexts18 and to the place of shame, pride, and status,19 especially
insofar as an understanding of these variables helps give content to people’s
utility functions in ways that bear on the uses of law. Our principal purpose
here, however, is to provide predictions, rather than to give full descriptions
of individual motivations and self-understandings, and we will refer to these
variables only occasionally and in passing. For similar reasons, we do not
emphasize behavioral patterns that depart from standard economic
assumptions but fail to point in systematic directions; such patterns would not
generate distinct predictions (although they would of course matter to a full
account of individual behavior). Our focus here is robust, empirically
documented phenomena that have reasonably precise implications for legal
issues.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-8">
      <title>B. Testable Predictions</title>
      <p>Behavioral and conventional law and economics do not differ solely in
their assumptions about human behavior. They also differ, in testable ways,
in their predictions about how law (as well as other forces) affects behavior.
To make these differences more concrete, consider the three “fundamental
principles of economics” set forth by Richard Posner in his Economic
Analysis of Law,20 in a discussion that is, on these points, quite conventional.
(Posner’s discussion represents an application of the basic economic
methodology set forth by Becker above.21) To what extent would an account
based on behavioral law and economics offer different “fundamental
principles”?</p>
      <p>The first fundamental principle for the conventional approach is
downward-sloping demand: Total demand for a good falls when its price rises.22
This prediction is, of course, valid. There are few if any documented cases
of Giffen goods (goods that are consumed more heavily at high prices, due to
the fact that the price increase makes people unable to afford goods that are
even pricier than the good in question). However, confirmation of the
prediction of downward-sloping demand does not suggest that people are
optimizing. As Becker has shown, even people choosing at random (rather than
in a way designed to serve their preferences) will tend to consume less of a
good when its price goes up as long as they have limited resources.23 This
behavior has also been demonstrated with laboratory rats.24 Thus, evidence
of downward-sloping demand is not evidence in support of optimizing
models.</p>
      <p>The second fundamental principle of conventional law and economics
concerns the nature of costs: “Cost to the economist is ‘opportunity cost,’”
and “‘[s]unk’ (incurred) costs do not affect decisions on prices and
quantity.”25 Thus, according to traditional analysis, decisionmakers will equate
opportunity costs (which are costs incurred by foregoing opportunities—say,
the opportunity to sell one’s possessions) to out-of-pocket costs (such as
costs incurred in buying possessions); and they will ignore sunk costs (costs
that cannot be recovered, such as the cost of nonrefundable tickets). But
each of these propositions is a frequent source of predictive failures. The
equality of opportunity costs and out-of-pocket costs implies that, in the
absence of important wealth effects, buying prices will be roughly equal to
selling prices. This is frequently violated, as is well known. Many people
holding tickets to a popular sporting event such as the Super Bowl would be
unwilling to buy tickets at the market price (say $1000), yet would also be
unwilling to sell at this price. Indeed, estimates of the ratio of selling prices
to buying prices are often at least two to one, yet the size of the transaction
makes it implausible in these studies to conclude that wealth effects explain
the difference.26 As described below, these results are just what behavioral
analysis suggests.</p>
      <p>The traditional assumption about sunk costs also generates invalid
predictions. Here is one: A theater patron who ignores sunk costs would not
take into account the cost of a prepaid season pass in deciding whether to
“rou[se] [him]self . . . to go out” on the evening of a particular
performance;27 the decision would be made purely on the basis of the benefits and
costs from that moment forward. However, in a study of theater patrons,
some of whom were randomly assigned to receive discounted prices on
prepaid passes, the patrons who received discounts were found to attend
significantly fewer performances than those who did not receive discounts, despite
the fact that (due to random assignment) the benefit-cost ratio that should
have mattered—benefits and costs going forward—was the same on average

in the two groups.28 In short, sunk costs mattered; again, the standard
prediction proved invalid.</p>
      <p>The third fundamental principle of conventional law and economics is
that “resources tend to gravitate toward their most valuable uses” as markets
drive out any unexploited profit opportunities.29 When combined with the
notion that opportunity and out-of-pocket costs are equated (see fundamental
principle two), this yields the Coase theorem—the idea that initial
assignments of entitlements will not affect the ultimate allocation of resources so
long as transaction costs are zero.30 Many economists and economically
oriented lawyers think of the Coase theorem as a tautology; if there were really
no transaction costs (and no wealth effects), and if an alternative allocation
of resources would make some agents better off and none worse off, then of
course the agents would move to that allocation. Careful empirical study,
however, shows that the Coase theorem is not a tautology; indeed, it can lead
to inaccurate predictions.31 That is, even when transaction costs and wealth
effects are known to be zero, initial entitlements alter the final allocation of
resources. These results are predicted by behavioral economics, which
emphasizes the difference between opportunity and out-of-pocket costs.</p>
      <p>Consider the following set of experiments conducted to test the Coase
theorem;32 let us offer an interpretation geared to the particular context of
economic analysis of law. The subjects were forty-four students taking an
advanced undergraduate course in law and economics at Cornell University.
Half the students were endowed with tokens. Each student (whether or not
endowed with a token) was assigned a personal token value, the price at
which a token could be redeemed for cash at the end of the experiment; these
assigned values induce supply and demand curves for the tokens. Markets
were conducted for tokens. Those without tokens could buy one, while those
with tokens could sell. Those with tokens should (and do) sell their tokens if
offered more than their assigned value; those without tokens should (and do)
buy tokens if they can get one at a price below their assigned value. These
token markets are a complete victory of economic theory. The equilibrium
price was always exactly what the theory would predict, and the tokens did
in fact flow to those who valued them most.</p>
      <p>However, life is generally not about tokens redeemable for cash. Thus
another experiment was conducted, identical to the first except that now half
the students were given Cornell coffee mugs instead of tokens. Here
behavioral analysis generates a prediction distinct from standard economic

sis: Because people do not equate opportunity and out-of-pocket costs for
goods whose values are not solely exogenously defined (as they were in the
case of the tokens), those endowed with mugs should be reluctant to part
with them even at prices they would not have considered paying to acquire a
mug had they not received one.</p>
      <p>Was this prediction correct? Yes. Markets were conducted and mugs
bought and sold. Unlike the case of the tokens, the assignment of property
rights had a pronounced effect on the final allocation of mugs. The students
who were assigned mugs had a strong tendency to keep them. Whereas the
Coase theorem would have predicted that about half the mugs would trade
(since transaction costs had been shown to be essentially zero in the token
experiments, and mugs were randomly distributed), instead only fifteen
percent of the mugs traded. And those who were endowed with mugs asked
more than twice as much to give up a mug as those who didn’t get a mug
were willing to pay. This result did not change if the markets were repeated.
This effect is generally referred to as the “endowment effect”; it is a
manifestation of the broader phenomenon of “loss aversion”—the idea that losses
are weighted more heavily than gains—which in turn is a central building
block of Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory.</p>
      <p>What are we to make of these findings? There are at least three
important lessons. First, markets are indeed robust institutions. Even naive
subjects participating at low stakes produce outcomes indistinguishable from
those predicted by the theory when trading for tokens. Second, when agents
must determine their own values (as with the mugs), outcomes can diverge
substantially from those predicted by economic theory. Third, these
departures will not be obvious outside an experiment, even when they exist and
have considerable importance. That is, even in the mugs markets, there was
trading; there was just not as much trading as the theory would predict.
These lessons can be applied to other markets; we offer some examples
below.</p>
      <p>The foregoing discussion illustrates the point with which we began this
section: The difference between conventional and behavioral law and
economics is not just a difference in the validity of the assumptions about human
behavior. While the assumptions of unbounded rationality, willpower, and
self-interest are unrealistic, the force of behavioral economics comes from
the difference in its predictions (for example, fewer trades for mugs than for
tokens). In this sense, our analysis is consistent with the precept originally
proposed by Milton Friedman: Economics should not be judged on whether
the assumptions are realistic or valid, but rather on the quality of its
predictions.33 We share this view (or at least will accept it for purposes of this
arti33. See MILTON FRIEDMAN, The Methodology of Positive Economics, in ESSAYS IN POSITIVE
ECONOMICS 3, 14-16 (1953).
cle); as we have emphasized, our principal interest is predictive in character.
A behavioral analysis would be of much less interest if conventional
economic models did a satisfactory job of predicting the behavior of agents
insofar as relevant to law. Unfortunately, they often do not.</p>

      <title>C. Partial and Ambiguous Successes of Conventional Economics</title>
      <p>
        What of all the well-known successes of conventional economics? Do
they show that predictions about law based on the conventional assumptions
tend to work? Consider some examples of the successes: (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ) the inverse
correlation between price ceilings and queues; (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ) the inverse correlation
between rent control and the stock of housing; (3) the positive correlation in
financial markets between risk and expected return; (4) the relation between
futures prices and spot-market prices.34 The problem with the first three
examples is that, as with tests of downward-sloping demand curves, they are
quite undemanding; they ask simply whether the theory gets the direction of
the effect right—and it does. But this is not a complete vindication of the
theory, for the theory may misstate the magnitude of the effect. Consider
(3), the positive relation between risk and return in financial markets. As
predicted by this theory, stocks (equities) earn higher returns (on average)
than do riskless assets such as treasury bills. But what can we say about the
magnitude? Is this difference in return roughly what the theory would
predict? This is precisely the question posed by Rajnish Mehra and Edward
Prescott in their well-known paper on the “equity premium puzzle.”35 The
equity premium is the difference in returns between equities and riskless
assets. In the United States, the equity premium has been roughly six percent
per year over the past seventy years.36 This implies that a dollar invested in
stocks in 1926 would, at the end of 1997, be worth over $1800, while a
dollar invested in treasury bills would have accumulated to less than $15. This
difference is remarkably large. Mehra and Prescott therefore ask whether it
can possibly be explained by investor risk aversion. They conclude that it
cannot. That is, no plausible value of risk aversion could explain such a big
difference.37 Although the theory gets the sign right in this case, the
magnitude of the effect suggests that the theory is wrong. (And note that arbitrage,
which we discuss just below, would not be expected to eliminate the equity
premium; there are often significant costs of arbitrage in equity markets.38)
      </p>
      <p>Example (4) above, the relation between spot and futures prices, does
better on magnitudes. Spot and futures prices are very closely related.
However, this case is special in several respects. First, arbitrage is possible. If
spot and futures prices get out of line, then investors can make sure profits by
buying the contract that is too cheap and selling the one that is too expensive.
Second, this context is one in which most of the activity is undertaken by
professionals who will quickly lose their money and their jobs if they make
frequent errors. Third, the markets in which these professionals operate offer
frequent opportunities for learning. Under these circumstances, markets tend
to work very well,39 though not perfectly.40 Essentially, these conditions
render agents who do not conform to the standard economic assumptions
irrelevant (because they will be bankrupt).</p>
      <p>So, in some (fairly unusual) circumstances, such as futures trading,
market forces are strong enough to make the three “bounds” irrelevant for
predictive purposes. The point is important; it suggests that while human beings
often display bounded rationality, willpower, and self-interest, markets can
sometimes lead to behavior consistent with conventional economic
assumptions. Then the question becomes when, exactly, do market forces make it
reasonable to assume that people behave in accordance with those
assumptions? What circumstances apply to most of the domains in which law and
economics is used?</p>
      <p>In this regard it is instructive to compare the market for futures contracts
with the market for criminal activity. Consider the proposition that a
potential criminal will commit some crime if the expected gains from the crime
exceed its expected costs.41 Suppose a criminal mistakenly thinks that the
expected gains outweigh the expected costs, when in fact the opposite is true.
First notice that no arbitrage will be possible in this situation. If someone is
unfortunate enough to commit a crime with a negative expected value, then
there is no way for anyone else to profit directly from his behavior. Outside
of financial markets (and not always there), those who engage in low-payoff
activities lose utility but do not create profit opportunities for others. Nor do
they typically disappear from the market. (Even poorly run firms can survive
for many years; consider GM.) Being a bad criminal is rarely fatal, and
except possibly for organized crime, there is little opportunity for “hostile
takeovers.” Finally, the decision to enter a life of crime is not one that is made
repeatedly with many opportunities to learn. Once a teenager has dropped
out of high school to become a drug dealer, it is difficult to switch to
dentistry.</p>
      <p>Because law and economics is frequently applied to criminal behavior,
the above argument is obviously germane. We think that the same analysis
applies to many of the domains in which law and economics has been used.
In fact, economic analysis of law seems to be a branch of economics in
which the limits of arbitrage are particularly powerful, so special care should
be taken not to push the standard economic model too far.</p>
      <p>This is by no means to say that conventional law and economics has had
no victories. One cannot look at the current state of antitrust law, or the use
of market-based regulation in environmental law (to name just two of many
examples), without acknowledging the important advances produced through
the conventional approach. Often this approach points in the right direction
and identifies flaws in noneconomic reasoning. Many advances in the
positive and prescriptive understanding of law have come from the conventional
assumptions. Attention to incentive effects can often reveal a great deal.
(Thus, those who would argue that rent control helps tenants must contend
with the obvious long-run supply effects of such laws.)</p>
      <p>The project of behavioral law and economics, as we see it, is to take the
core insights and successes of economics and build upon them by making
more realistic assumptions about human behavior. We wish to retain the
power of the economist’s approach to social science while offering a better
description of the behavior of the agents in society and the economy.
Behavioral law and economics, in short, offers the potential to be law and
economics with a higher “R2”—that is, greater power to explain the observed
data. We will try to highlight some of that potential (and suggest cases
where it has been realized) in this article.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-10">
      <title>D. Parsimony</title>
      <p>A possible objection to our approach is that conventional economics has
the advantage of simplicity and parsimony. At least—the objection goes—it
provides a theory. By contrast, a behavioral perspective offers a more
complicated and unruly picture of human behavior, and perhaps that picture will
make prediction more difficult, precisely because behavior is more
complicated and unruly. Everything can be explained in an ex post fashion—some
tool will be found that is up to the task—but the elegance, generalizability,
and predictive power of the economic method will be lost. Shouldn’t
analysts proceed with simple tools? We offer two responses: First, simplicity
and parsimony are indeed beneficial; it would be highly desirable to come up
with a model of behavior that is both simple and right. But conventional
economics is not in this position, for its predictions are often wrong. We will
encounter many examples in addition to those already discussed.</p>
      <p>
        Second, to the extent that conventional economics achieves parsimony, it
often does so at the expense of any real predictive power. Its goal is to
provide a unitary theory of behavior, a goal which may be impossible to
achieve. By itself the notion of “rationality” (the centerpiece of traditional
analysis) is not a theory; to generate predictions it must be more fully
specified, often through the use of auxiliary assumptions.42 Indeed, the term
“rationality” is highly ambiguous and can be used to mean many things. A
person might be deemed rational if her behavior (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ) conforms to the axioms of
expected utility theory; (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ) is responsive to incentives, that is, if the actor
changes her behavior when the costs and benefits are altered; (3) is internally
consistent; (4) promotes her own welfare; or (5) is effective in achieving her
goals, whatever the relationship between those goals and her actual welfare.
We observe departures from most of these definitions; thus, with respect to
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ), scholars have documented departures from expected utility theory for
nearly fifty years, and prospect theory seems to predict behavior better.43
With respect to (4) and (5), people’s decisions sometimes do not promote
their welfare or help them to achieve their own goals; and with respect to (3),
behavioral research shows that people sometimes behave in an inconsistent
manner by, for example, indicating a preference for X over Y if asked to
make a direct choice, but Y over X if asked to give their willingness to pay
for each option.44 Many of our examples will thus show that people are
frequently not rational if the term is understood to mean (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ), (3), (4), or (5). As
for (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ), without some specification of what counts as a cost and a benefit, the
idea of responsiveness to incentives is empty. If rationality is used to mean
simply that people “choose” what they “prefer” in light of the prevailing
incentives,45 then the notion of rationality offers few restrictions on behavior.
The person who drinks castor oil as often as possible is rational because she
happens to love castor oil. Other self-destructive behavior (drug addiction,
suicide, etc.) can be explained on similar grounds. It is not even clear on this
view whether rationality is intended as a definition of “preference” or as a
prediction.46
      </p>
      <p>If such a notion of rationality allowed for good predictions, then perhaps
there would be no reason for complaint; the problem, however, is that so
high a degree of flexibility leaves the theory with few a priori restrictions. A
theory with infinite degrees of freedom is no theory at all. For example,
consider whether it is a paradox (as many economists think) that so many people
vote (despite the virtual certainty that no one person’s vote will alter the
outcome). If it is a paradox, so much the worse for the rationality assumption; if
it is not a paradox, what does the assumption predict? Does it merely predict
that people will respond to changes in conditions—for example, fewer
people will vote when it is snowing? If so, the prediction is not bad, but surely it
would be possible to say, after an unusually large vote amidst the storm, that
more people voted simply because voting seemed especially valiant in those
circumstances (so much for predictions based on this form of rationality).
Conventional economics sometimes turns to stronger forms of rationality in
response, and those forms provide stronger predictions in some cases; but
those predictions are often inaccurate, as described above and as illustrated
by the examples considered below.</p>
      <p>We believe that a behavioral approach imposes discipline on economic
theorizing because assumptions cannot be imported at will. In a behavioral
approach, assumptions about behavior should accord with empirically
validated descriptions of actual behavior. For example, in the case of “fairness,”
specifically defined and empirically verified patterns of behavior are used to
generate predictions in new contexts. (“Fairness” is not, on this view, simply
a catch-all to explain any observed behavior.) This is the approach we
advocate for economic analysis of law. This approach, we believe, produces a
better understanding of law and a better set of predictions about its effects.</p>
      <p>We now turn to positive, prescriptive, and normative issues. Our
purpose is not to settle all of them, but to show the promise of behavioral
economics in casting light on a wide range of questions. A great deal of work
would be necessary to justify authoritative judgments on most of these
questions. What follows should be taken partly as a proposal, perhaps in the
spirit of the early economic analysis of law, for a research agenda to be
carried out with a new set of tools.</p>

      <p>We begin with bounded self-interest, the third bound described above. A
useful first example of this bound is agents’ behavior in a very simple
bargaining game called the ultimatum game. In this game, one player, the
Prowe think this is a sensible prescription in such settings, we note that it will
not eliminate the effects of hindsight bias, since (as proponents of bifurcated
trials recognize) “the jury will undoubtedly know that they are not being
asked simply to engage in an academic exercise,”166 and that (because a trial
is being held) “a bad outcome must have occurred.”167 In contrast, in cases
in which jurors need not know (because they cannot infer from the fact of a
lawsuit) what choice the defendant made, it may be possible to eliminate the
hindsight bias completely. And there are many such situations: cases in
which either of two options facing a physician could have caused harm or
death to a patient; cases in which either the use or the failure to use a new
technology could have led to harm; cases in which either revealing or failing
to reveal suicide threats by a psychiatric patient could have resulted in
suicide.</p>
      <p>A further feature of our prescription here is that even if we are wrong
about the effects of hindsight bias, the prescription seems unlikely to do
significant harm (from the perspective of the specified goal of achieving correct
application of the ex ante cost-benefit standard). If hindsight bias is
unimportant, then whether jurors are told what outcome occurred should not
matter; either way, they should be able to make a correct ex ante determination.
Thus, the prescription should either have no effect on decisionmaking (if
hindsight bias is not a problem) or represent an improvement over the current
system (if hindsight bias is a problem).</p>
      <p>Second prescription: Alter the evidentiary standard. The result of
hindsight bias, as described above, is that jurors will overestimate the probability
that harm will occur (since harm did, in fact, occur). The determination of
the probability of harm would conventionally be made under a
“preponderance of the evidence” standard: If jurors think it more likely than not, based
on the evidence, that the probability of harm was above the threshold level
required for liability, they are to find the defendant liable. One might
imagine counteracting the effects of hindsight bias by raising the evidentiary
standard (as an alternative, not in addition, to the previous proposal; the two
together would produce overcorrection and, thus, underdeterrence). Thus, for
example, if the jurors were to find the defendant liable only if the evidence
suggested at least a seventy-five percent likelihood—rather than merely a
fifty-one percent likelihood—that the critical harm probability threshold was
met, then they might well reach the correct conclusion about liability: They
would overestimate the likelihood attached to the critical threshold, but the
overestimate might well be below the new required level.

      <p>The highest evidentiary threshold known to our legal system—the
“beyond a reasonable doubt” standard—is used only in criminal cases.
However, in civil cases an intermediate standard (higher than the preponderance
standard, but less demanding than the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard)
is the “clear and convincing evidence” standard. This standard has been
adopted by many states for punitive-damage determinations,168 and a
broadening of its use to all negligence determinations—or at least those in which
hindsight bias seems most likely to present a significant problem—might
provide a desirable counterweight to the tendency of jurors to overestimate
the probability that harm will occur. (Of course, further study would be
required before reaching a final conclusion here.) This, of course, would be
likely to be a second-best solution; in some situations defendants might be
found not liable when, under a perfectly functioning system with no
hindsight bias and no heightened evidentiary standard, they would be found
liable.169 This need not be the case, however, and even if it is, we might well
tolerate a crude measure that produced some errors so long as it represented
an improvement over the current system. Most importantly, there is much
room for research focused on determining whether altering the evidentiary
threshold would represent a desirable response on balance—either across the
board or in particular categories of cases. Our goal is to suggest the value of
research on this issue, rather than to urge an immediate change in policy
based on what we now know.</p>
      <p>To fix ideas for purposes of exploring these points, imagine first that
hindsight bias produces a similar increase across cases in a juror’s perceived
likelihood that the negligence threshold is met. (So, for example, suppose
that jurors generally overestimate by fifty percent the likelihood that the
negligence threshold is met, based on the evidence presented.) In this
circumstance, the overestimation of the likelihood that the negligence threshold
is met could in theory be precisely offset by a change in the evidentiary
threshold. To see this point, imagine that the likelihood that the negligence
threshold has been met is graphed as a function of the strength of the
evidence. In the absence of hindsight bias, the function will cross the
fiftypercent (preponderance) cut-off at a given level of evidentiary strength, and
all cases in which the evidence is stronger than that should produce findings
of liability. But with hindsight bias, jurors will overestimate the likelihood
that the negligence threshold has been met, and this will produce an upward
shift in the function we are imagining; as a result, too many cases will cross
the preponderance line. But if that line itself is shifted up by an appropriate
amount, the hindsight-influenced function will cross it at precisely the same
level of evidentiary strength as the one at which the original function crossed
168. See Developments in the Law—The Civil Jury, 110 HARV. L. REV. 1408, 1531 (1997).
169. See Rachlinski, supra note 158, at 606-07.
the preponderance standard. For instance, if the likelihood that the
negligence threshold has been met is a linear function of the strength of the
evidence, half of all cases in the system meet the threshold under the
preponderance standard, and jurors overestimate by fifty percent the likelihood that the
threshold is met, then a move to a seventy-five-percent likelihood
requirement would result in the jurors’ finding negligence in precisely the half of
cases in which it should be found.</p>
      <p>If hindsight bias produces different degrees of distortion in jurors’
probability estimates across different types of cases, then a shift to a higher
evidentiary standard might result in underdeterrence of some defendants
(specifically those whose actions will not be judged in a particularly
hindsightbiased way). But as long as the increase in the evidentiary standard is
modest relative to what hindsight bias in the average case warrants, the change
would produce fewer “underdeterrence errors” (findings of no liability for
defendants who should be found liable) than corrections of “overdeterrence
errors” (findings of liability for defendants who should not be found liable).
And the change from a move to the “clear and convincing evidence”
standard would be a relatively modest one; a survey of federal district court
judges found that in the judges’ view that standard requires a likelihood of
sixty to seventy percent, compared to the fifty-one percent threshold under
the preponderance standard.170 (Of course, more interesting would be data
on how jurors view the two standards.)</p>
      <p>One response to this analysis is that the reason jurors tend to find
defendants liable even when liability is not legally warranted is not that jurors
overestimate the probability of harm, but simply that they want to
compensate tort victims. Our first prescription addresses the latter issue as well as
the former, for if jurors do not know what harm occurred, it is difficult for
them to engage in compensation-based decisionmaking. (In the case of the
food-processing company discussed above, the jurors, to ensure
compensation for the harm that occurred, would have to say that the company was
negligent whether it used the chemical or refrained from using it—probably
not a likely scenario.) But as far as the second prescription is concerned, the
problem of compensation-based decisionmaking remains. So if this is what
is going on, jurors may continue to find defendants liable, regardless of a
higher evidentiary threshold. But there is no reason to think the existence of
a higher threshold will make things worse in this situation, and so as long as
there are some cases in which jurors try faithfully to apply the negligence
standard, moving to the higher evidentiary threshold may improve
decisionmaking. The same response may be offered to the objection that jurors’
behavior is not sensitive to the evidentiary threshold—a point on which there is
170. United States v. Fatico, 458 F. Supp. 388, 410 (E.D.N.Y. 1978).
conflicting evidence;171 as long as an increase in the threshold will matter in
some cases, the change may be desirable, since there is no reason to think it
will cause harm in cases in which it does not change jurors’ behavior.</p>
      <p>A final objection might be that altering the evidentiary standard would
not (it is claimed) survive the Kantian-Rawlsian publicity condition, which
means, roughly, that principles of justice must be defensible publicly, and
that their basis and content must not be secret.172 The question is whether it
is coherent to tell jurors that: Although this case should be decided by the
preponderance of the evidence, we know that you are likely to think
irrationally, so therefore we raise the threshold to clear and convincing evidence.
We do not believe that there is anything incoherent, or violative of the
publicity condition, in an idea of this sort. In both private and public life,
people, acting individually or in groups, take steps to ensure against their own
tendencies to make mistakes. (We discussed in Part I.A the steps that people
frequently take to deal with problems of bounded willpower.) Raising the
standard of proof to prevent errors is consistent with much of the law of
evidence, which is also designed to respond to cognitive errors. As just one
example, consider the restrictions on admission of evidence of prior crimes.173
A public defense of such steps is perfectly intelligible.</p>

      <title>Other applications.</title>
      <p>The discussion to this point has focused on tort cases decided under the
negligence standard, but similar issues may arise in other areas of law in
which juries (or judges) must determine whether an ex ante standard was met
while armed with the knowledge that a negative event in fact materialized.
One example is securities fraud litigation, whose perceived excesses
prompted Congress to enact the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995.174 In a typical securities fraud case, decisionmakers are confronted
with a company whose stock price experienced a dramatic fall, and they are
required to assess whether a particular issue or problem facing the company,
whose disclosure prompted the fall, should have been disclosed at an earlier
stage (typically before it had become an issue or problem). Decisionmakers
in such a case are required to make an after-the-fact determination of
whether a reasonable ex ante decisionmaker would have thought the
prospective issue or problem “material” to the average shareholder based on the
information available at the time.175 The problem is that this determination
must be made against the backdrop of knowledge that the issue or problem in
fact materialized, and produced a large drop in the company’s stock price. In
this situation, a decisionmaker will likely find it difficult to see how a
reasonable ex ante decisionmaker might have thought the prospective issue or
problem other than material. Consistent with this analysis, the main
predictor of whether a securities fraud action is brought seems to be whether there
has been a large change in the company’s stock market value, not whether
the company’s behavior was reasonable from an ex ante perspective.176</p>
      <p>Another example here involves damage suits for violations of the Fourth
Amendment. A risk in such suits is that if the allegedly illegal search did in
fact produce damaging evidence (say, drugs or other contraband), then
decisionmakers are likely to conclude that the law enforcement agency’s
behavior was reasonable. This will be true even if, from an ex ante perspective
(without knowing the eventual outcome), this behavior would not have been
found reasonable.</p>

    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-15">
      <title>1. Background.</title>
      <p>Suppose it is agreed that individuals lack adequate information on a
given subject—for example, workplace safety, appliance energy efficiency,
or the effects of drug use. In some such instances the government may seek
to foster comparison shopping and informed decisionmaking (as in the
federal truth-in-lending law, which requires lenders to announce interest rates,
measured the same way177); in other instances the government may have a
specific policy goal (reducing drug use, encouraging the use of
energyefficient refrigerators). Conventional economics acknowledges the possible
desirability of each of these goals (the second in the case of phenomena such
as externalities), and it often advocates, as a means of achieving them,
providing additional information to citizens, either through a mandate to the
relevant private actors (for instance, employers), or through provision of
information by the government itself.178</p>
      <p>The prescription to “provide more information” is striking in its
spareness. Behavioral analysis suggests that this prescription is far too spare.
“Provide more information” says nothing about the way in which the
information will be provided, and yet we know from much of what has been said
already, as well as from empirical work by scholars such as W. Kip Viscusi,
that this will matter a great deal.179 Thus, for example, we know that
people’s perceptions of the probability of uncertain events is influenced by the
salience of the presentation of these events.</p>
      <p>That presentation matters has several implications. One is
“antiprescriptive”: Prescriptions directed toward fostering comparison shopping—the
first government goal mentioned above—will often be incomplete and may
even be paralyzing, since there is often no “neutral” way to present
information. The second implication is that effective prescriptive strategies for
achieving the second goal mentioned above—discouraging particular types
of behavior—must take behavioral factors into account. It is not enough
simply to “provide information.” We discuss several examples of this below.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-16">
      <title>2. Antiprescription.</title>
      <p>Consider the following example of a government attempt to foster
informed decisionmaking: In the case of defined contribution plans such as
401(k)s, the Labor Department, the relevant government authority, has ruled
that employers must give employees investment alternatives, and must
provide information about those alternatives (such as risk and returns); but firms
are not allowed to offer “advice” as to how to invest.180 We think that such
spare guidelines place employers in a very difficult position. The reason is
that the way firms decide to describe and display information on investment
alternatives will have a powerful impact on the choices employees make.</p>
      <p>Consider in this connection a recent study of the division of retirement
savings by university staff employees between two different funds, a safe
one (bonds) and a risky one (stocks).181 All the employees were shown
actual historical data on the returns of the two funds, but this information was
displayed in two different ways; one group was given the distribution of
oneyear rates of return, while the other was given a simulated distribution of
thirty-year rates of return. Those shown the thirty-year returns elected to
invest nearly all their savings in stocks, while those shown the one-year
returns invested a majority of their funds in bonds. Our point is not that one of
these outcomes is better. Our point is simply that in the real world, she who
provides information ends up giving advice.</p>
      <p>This is an example in which the prescription to “provide more
information” may be paralyzing; in other instances it may simply be incomplete.
Thus, suppose that the prescription is that certain private actors be required
to provide “information”; what does this mean? If it means that those who
expose people to a dangerous substance or product in the workplace (say
benzene) must provide them with accurate information about the danger, this
leaves open a tremendous range of possibilities. The actors subject to the
mandate will often have an interest in providing the least scary, most pallid
version of the information possible (for example, “benzene has been
associated with a statistical increase in risk”), while regulators might want the most
scary, salient message available (say, “exposure to benzene will increase
your risk of getting CANCER and other FATAL diseases”). Of course, the
best message in this case, if the goal is accurate knowledge, may well be
somewhere in between. An important goal of the analyst’s task in making
prescriptions in this area is to say how the information should be provided—
not just that it should be provided.</p>
      <p>In still other contexts, such as ones in which the presentation of
information will affect people’s preferences rather than just their perceptions of risk,
it is not even clear in theory what is meant by ensuring “informed
decisionmaking.” It is not even clear that there are steady or stable background
preferences that might be “informed.” The preferences can themselves be an
artifact of the method of informing. For instance, one of the central features
of Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory is that people evaluate
outcomes based on the change they represent from an initial reference point,
rather than based on the nature of the outcome itself; also, losses from the
initial reference point are weighted much more heavily than gains.182 This
aspect of prospect theory (like its other features) is based on evidence about
actual choice behavior.183 The evaluation of outcomes in terms of gains and
182. See Kahneman &amp; Tversky, supra note 12, at 277-79.</p>
      <p>183. See id. at 273 (outcomes are viewed differently depending on whether they come in the
form of gains or losses from a perceived status quo); id. at 279 (citing Eugene Galanter &amp; Patricia
Pliner, Cross-Modality Matching of Money Against Other Continua, in SENSATION AND
MEASUREMENT 65 (Howard R. Moskowitz, Bertram Scharf &amp; Joseph C. Stevens eds., 1974))
(losses are weighted more heavily than gains). Another feature of how outcomes are viewed, both
empirically and under prospect theory, is that a given change produces less reaction the further a
decisionmaker is from her reference point. Thus, for example, the value difference between $10
and $20 is greater than the value difference between $1000 and $1010, both for gains and for losses,
assuming a reference point of $0. See id. at 278. In terms of the shape of the “value function” for
decisionmakers (a function giving the value of each outcome–this is prospect theory’s counterpart
to the utility function), this suggests a function that is concave for gains and convex for losses; only
with that shape are both gains and losses viewed as less significant the further the decisionmaker is
from her reference point. See id. This shape of the value function is further supported by evidence
of attitudes toward risk: People appear generally (though there are exceptions) to exhibit
risklosses from an initial reference point, coupled with the special aversion to
losses, means that it matters a great deal whether something is presented as a
gain or a loss relative to the status quo; a perceived threat of a loss relative to
the status quo weighs more heavily than a perceived threat of foregoing a
gain. In such cases it is difficult to say which individual is “informed”—the
one who is told of the perceived threat of a loss or the one who is told of the
perceived threat of foregoing a gain. In this and other contexts, preferences
are not preexisting but rather “constructive, context-dependent,” analogous
to the balls or strikes that do not predate the situation of choice and that
“ain’t nothing till” the umpire calls them.184</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-17">
      <title>3. Prescriptions.</title>
      <p>Suppose now that the agreed-upon goal is not to foster “informed
decisionmaking,” but to discourage particular types of behavior. Conventional
economics would view this as a desirable goal at least to the extent that
fullyinformed consumers would not engage in the behavior in question, and to an
even greater extent if the behavior in question produces externality effects.
And to achieve this goal, conventional economics would again prescribe, as
one possible means, “more information.” (Other, probably more usual,
means include taxation and regulation designed to discourage the unwanted
behavior.) Quite obviously, though, some ways of providing information are
more effective than others. There is nothing surprising about this statement.
Presumably, when firms pay millions of dollars to advertising agencies to
create splashy new ad campaigns, they think they are getting something for
their money. Likewise, there is of course an enormous marketing literature
about how best to shape people’s behavior in desired directions. These
points apply equally to the government. Below we develop briefly some
specific prescriptions for achieving goals that involve changing people’s
behavior.</p>
      <p>First prescription: Exploit loss aversion. As just noted, individuals tend
to weight losses far more heavily than gains. As a result, framing
consequences in terms of losses rather than gains is likely to be far more effective
in changing behavior.185 A well-known illustration of this sort of framing
averse attitudes towards gains but risk-seeking attitudes toward losses, and these attitudes imply
concavity of the value function for gains and convexity for losses. See id. This pattern of concavity
and convexity has received considerable empirical support. See id. at 268, 278; Peter C. Fishburn
&amp; Gary A. Kochenberger, Two-Piece Von Neumann-Morgenstern Utility Functions, 10 DECISION
SCI. 503, 509-10 (1979).</p>

effect is a study involving breast self-examination; pamphlets describing the
positive effects of breast self-examination (for example, women who
undertake such examinations have a greater chance of finding a tumor at a
treatable stage) are ineffective, but there are significant changes in behavior from
pamphlets that stress the negative consequences of a refusal to undertake
self-examinations (women who fail to perform such examinations have a
decreased chance of finding a tumor at a treatable stage).186 Note that this
example illustrates how the provision of information may be a more natural
tool than taxation or regulation for discouraging some forms of behavior
(such as the failure to perform a self-examination).</p>
      <p>Second prescription: Exploit salience. Effective prescriptive strategies
need to take account of the fact that vivid and personal information will often
be more effective than statistical evidence. This sort of information has a
high degree of salience, and, as a result of the availability heuristic, people
will tend to respond to it by attaching a higher probability to the event in
question. Thus an antidrug advertisement, showing a frying egg with the
announcer’s voice claiming, “this is your brain on drugs,” appeared to have a
significant effect on behavior.187 Availability suggests that the ad produced a
higher perceived probability of negative effects than a flatter ad would have.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-18">
      <title>Third prescription: Avoid the pitfalls of overoptimism. As noted in the</title>
      <p>previous section, a common feature of human behavior is overoptimism.188
This behavior is not specific to the young, although it may be diminished as
people move beyond middle to old age, as Richard Posner has suggested.189
What does this feature of behavior imply about government provision of
information? Consider the choice between a safe-driving campaign focused on
drivers’ own driving and the ingenuous campaign actually adopted by the
government: “Drive defensively: Watch out for the other guy.”190 The
government’s campaign, perhaps self-consciously, responded to the fact that
most people tend to believe that they are unusually safe drivers. This is a
model of the sort of prescriptive approach advocated by behavioral analysis.</p>

      <title>C. Behavior of Criminals</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-20">
      <title>1. Background.</title>
      <p>Our discussion of prescriptive analysis has thus far focused on bounded
rationality. But bounded willpower may also play a role. Consider the
question of deterring criminal behavior. Economic analysis of this question
typically starts from the premise that potential offenders will be deterred
from criminal acts if the expected costs of those acts exceed their expected
benefits.191 Potential offenders are imagined to make at least a rough
calculation of these costs and benefits in the process of making their decisions.
Bounded rationality suggests that people may make systematic (as opposed
to random) errors in computing these costs and benefits; for example, as
described above, individuals tend to judge the likelihood of uncertain events
(such as getting caught for a crime) by how available such instances are to
the human mind, and this may depend on factors unrelated to the actual
probability of the event. This analysis suggests the desirability, from a
prescriptive standpoint, of making law enforcement highly visible, holding
constant the actual probability that offenders will be caught; it suggests, for
example, the good sense of the familiar method of parking-ticket
enforcement—sticking large, brightly-colored tickets that read “VIOLATION” in
large letters on the drivers’ side window, where they are particularly
noticeable to drivers passing by—as opposed to a less costly approach (putting
small, plain tickets under the windshield wiper on the curb side of the street,
convenient for the parking officer to reach). Another example here is
“community policing,” now widely practiced across the country; by making more
visible and memorable the presence of police (as, for example, by having
them walk their beats rather than ride in patrol cars), authorities can, it is
suggested, increase the deterrence of potential criminals without altering the
actual probability of apprehension.</p>
      <p>But even if one assumes that potential offenders can accurately compute
the costs and benefits of crime, bounded willpower suggests that they will
often behave in ways at odds with conventional economic analysis, due to
problems of self-control. A central feature of much criminal behavior is that
the benefits are immediate, while the costs (if they are incurred at all) are
spread out over time—often a very long time. Economic analysis assumes
that such future costs are discounted to present value, and A. Mitchell
Polinsky and Steven Shavell have recently suggested that potential criminal
offenders may have unusually high discount rates, so that years in prison far in
191. See Shavell, supra note 41, at 1235.
the future will be discounted very heavily.192 Behavioral economic analysis
carries this idea further by incorporating self-control issues often emphasized
by criminologists.193</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-21">
      <title>2. Prescriptions.</title>
      <p>As just noted, the existing economic analysis assumes a constant
discount rate (although perhaps a high one); this means that the difference
between the attractiveness or aversiveness of a reward or punishment today
versus tomorrow is the same as the difference between a year from now and
a year and one day from now. In contrast to this theory, there is considerable
evidence that people display sharply declining discount rates.194 This means
that impatience is very strong for near rewards (and aversion very strong for
near punishments) but that each of these declines over time—a pattern
referred to as “hyperbolic discounting.”195 Such attitudes reflect “dynamic
inconsistency”; one’s present desires for the future are at odds with one’s
future desires for the future.196 In an illuminating overstatement, Jon Elster has
referred to this as the “absolute priority of the present”—akin to the
“absolute priority [of the self] over other persons: I am I—while they are all ‘out
there.’”197 Richard Posner has recently applied these ideas to issues of aging
and old age,198 and their application to criminal offenders is supported by the
idea that such offenders often behave “impulsive[ly]” and then have to
“exaggerat[e] the benefits of crime” in order to justify their behavior to
themselves later.199 Such a need for justification would not occur with the
ordinary discounting assumed by most conventional economic analysis;
decisions would not be regretted later because with that form of discounting there
is no dynamic inconsistency of preference.200</p>
      <p>What does hyperbolic discounting imply for effective deterrence of
criminal behavior? With this sort of bounded willpower on the part of
potential offenders, the difference between not getting caught and being
imprisoned for, say, a year differs dramatically from the difference between
being imprisoned for ten years and being imprisoned for eleven years (even
apart from any fixed costs that may accompany the fact of conviction).
While the standard theory says that these two things differ only insofar as the
costs of imprisonment in year eleven must be discounted to present value in
order to be compared with the loss of wages and personal freedom in year
one, behavioral economic analysis (and basic common sense) tells us that
this is not so. Short punishments will thus have much more effect than long
punishments as a result of the “priority of the present”; adding years onto a
sentence will produce little additional deterrence.201 This idea is reflected in
policy recommendations such as Mark Kleiman’s “coerced abstinence”
proposal, under which drug offenders on probation or parole would be swiftly
and automatically punished, but with modest sanctions, for any positive drug
result.202 Short punishments are also desirable under Polinsky and Shavell’s
approach, but for a different reason.</p>
      <p>Our analysis is consistent with empirical evidence suggesting that
criminal behavior is correlated with high levels of self-control problems. It
appears, for example, that drunk-driving behavior is significantly correlated
with not wearing a seat belt—itself a behavior that seems to suggest a very
high weight on the present, and thus a lack of self-control in the sense used
here.203 Another interesting piece of empirical evidence concerns offenders’
views of sentences of different lengths. One study found that they view a
five-year term of imprisonment as, on average, only twice as bad as a
oneyear term; the five-year term had a perceived severity of 200, compared to
100 for the one-year term.204 This alone is also consistent with a high
discount rate—a rate of roughly 0.5. But with that discount rate, the difference
between a five- and ten-year term should be quite small (approximately 6 on
the severity measure); in fact, the difference was 300.205 This difference is
also somewhat higher than hyperbolic discounting would suggest; if the
difference between 100 and 200 represents a .25 weight on all years after the
first year (so that the five-year term’s severity is 100 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 =
200), then the ten-year term’s severity would be 325—much closer than the
206 predicted by the nonhyperbolic approach, although still less than the
actual severity rating of 500. These data are of course only suggestive; we
have not shown that the bounded willpower approach leads to improved
predictions of actual criminal behavior. Empirical work on actual behavior of
this sort is notoriously difficult, but scholars such as Steven Levitt have
begun to demonstrate the possibilities in this area.206 A full analysis of criminal
behavior would also need to incorporate other factors not considered here
(such as the role of community); our goal is only to sketch some of the many
ways in which conventional economic analysis of criminal law can be
usefully extended using the tools of behavioral economics.</p>
      <sec id="sec-21-1">
        <title>V. NORMATIVE ANALYSIS: ANTI-ANTIPATERNALISM</title>
        <p>In its normative orientation, conventional law and economics is often
strongly antipaternalistic. The idea of “consumer sovereignty” plays a large
role; citizens, assuming they have reasonable access to relevant information,
are thought to be the best judges of what will promote their own welfare.
Yet many of the instances of bounded rationality discussed above call this
idea into question—and also, as we will emphasize below, call into question
the idea that intervention by government actors, who themselves may face
the same cognitive or motivational problems as everyone else, can improve
matters. In this way bounded rationality pushes toward a sort of
antiantipaternalism—a skepticism about antipaternalism, but not an affirmative
defense of paternalism.207 We also note (although we do not explore this
point here) that while bounded rationality may increase the need for law (if
government’s failings are less serious than citizens’), bounded self-interest
may reduce it, by creating norms that solve collective action problems even
without government intervention.208</p>

    <sec id="sec-22">
      <title>A. Citizen Error</title>
      <p>Many of the forms of bounded rationality discussed above call into
question the idea of consumer sovereignty. For example, overoptimism
leads most people to believe that their own risk of a negative outcome is far
lower than the average person’s. Similarly, the effect of salience may lead to
substantial underestimation of certain risks encountered in everyday life (for
example, the risks from poor diet), since these harms may not be very salient.</p>

207. See Sunstein, supra note 3, at 1178.</p>
      <p>208. A standard argument for law under the conventional economic approach is that
selfinterested people will create collective irrationality; if people are boundedly self-interested,
however, this problem may tend to disappear.
When overoptimism is combined with salience, people may underestimate
risks substantially. We emphasize that these problems are not ones of
insufficient information per se; they are ones of insufficient ability to process
accurately the information one possesses insofar as that information bears on
one’s own risks. Thus, for example, people may have reasonably adequate
information about the risks of smoking,209 but this does not at all imply that
they have adequate perceptions of the risks of smoking that they themselves
face.210 Even if people can obtain accurate statistical knowledge, statistical
knowledge may not be enough to inform actual choices.211 It does not follow
from this that information is useless; it is just that having information per se
does not automatically imply optimal behavior.</p>
      <p>Further questions about the idea of consumer sovereignty arise from the
gap between “decision” and “experience” utility. The utility of actual
experience may diverge from the anticipated utility as revealed by people’s
decisions.212 The identity of decision and experience utility in conventional
economics is often treated as an axiom, or at least as a proposition that could not
be falsified. But behavioral research shows that people’s judgments about
their future experience at the time of decision can be mistaken, in the sense
that people are sometimes unable (even apart from the sorts of informational
issues recognized by conventional economics) to assess what the experience
will actually be like. Thus, for example, people appear not to predict
accurately the consequences of becoming seriously ill or disabled.213 They tend
to underestimate their ability to adapt to negative changes, a point that may
bear on law and policy in such areas as global climate change.214</p>
      <p>But this suggestion about adaptation raises a complex normative
question: Is a person’s measure of welfare after (for example) becoming ill the
appropriate measure of value? Perhaps people, through coping mechanisms,
are able to adapt to disease better than they anticipate in advance, but does
this mean that disease is a less severe problem than prior attitudes would
have suggested? On conventional utilitarian grounds, the answer is probably
affirmative; the subjective experience is what counts. But a well-established
challenge to utilitarian analysis suggests the possibility of a negative answer,
on the ground that subjective experience may not be all that counts.215 What
we mean to suggest here is a simple point: People sometimes do mispredict
their utility at the time of decision, and on conventional grounds, this
phenomenon raises serious problems for the idea of consumer sovereignty.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-23">
      <title>B. Behavioral Bureaucrats</title>
      <p>Any suggestion that the government should intervene in response to
people’s mistakes raises the question whether the government will be able to
avoid such errors. The prospects for productive and useful intervention may
be smallest in the case of populist government; the actions of such a
government, based heavily on pressures coming from citizens, may tend to be
subject to the very same biases and errors that afflict citizens. (Thus behavioral
analysis complements existing accounts of the problems with populism.) An
example of the effects of populism is the Superfund statute, discussed in Part
III.C; irregular perceptions of risk by ordinary people may tend to produce
irregularities in regulation, as the cognitive errors that ordinary people make
are replicated in statutory and administrative law.216 The effects of social
interaction may even make government action worse, and more dangerous,
than individual errors. Our earlier discussion suggests a possible
mechanism: Availability entrepreneurs in the private sector can heighten the
demand for regulation, and public sector availability entrepreneurs can take
advantage of, and heighten, this effect, by advocating anecdote-driven
policy. Thus public choice accounts of legislation can work productively with
behavioral accounts; there is a good deal of synergy between behavioral
mechanisms and interest group leaders, many of whom are amateur (or
professional?) behavioral economists. The pollutant-of-the-month syndrome in
environmental law is paralleled by many measures responding to the
crisisof-the-month. These difficulties with populist government also point to
problems with the referendum process.</p>
      <p>But populist government is not the only worry. Government will often
be subject to cognitive and motivational problems even if it is not populist.
(Bureaucrats may also lack appropriate incentives to make decisions in the
public interest.217) Thus, for example, there is no necessary reason to think
215. See JON ELSTER, SOUR GRAPES: STUDIES IN THE SUBVERSION OF RATIONALITY (1983);

that government officials are, by virtue of their offices, able to avoid
overoptimism or predict experience utility. On the other hand, a degree of
insulation from populist pressures, combined with knowledge of behavioral
economics, might produce some improvement. New institutions may play a
role; consider Justice Breyer’s plea for an insulated body of specialized civil
servants, entrusted with the job of comparing risks and ensuring that
resources are devoted to the most serious problems;218 Howard Margolis’
behaviorally-informed suggestion that government should be required to ensure
that all initiatives “do no harm”;219 even proposals for cost-benefit analysis,
understood in a behavioral light as an attempt to overcome biases and
confusions in both perception and motivation.220 We also emphasize that
government intervention need not come in highly coercive forms; perhaps
distortions in people’s decisionmaking can be overcome by information campaigns
falling well short of coercion. For instance, in the contexts of risks such as
smoking, might debiasing techniques work to link the statistical evidence
with the personal reality?</p>
      <p>All of the foregoing ideas raise many complexities; and we have not
even touched upon the complicated philosophical literature on the legitimacy
of paternalism. Application of these ideas to any specific topic in law would
require a much fuller development of many issues than the space in this
article permits. But we need not leave the ideas in purely abstract form;
consider the following simple illustration of their application. Imagine that
sunlamps are being sold in an unregulated market and that it is learned that
many consumers fall asleep under the lamps, burning themselves badly.
Consumers make this mistake in spite of warnings included on the package
and in the instructions, perhaps because they fail to anticipate that lying in a
warm place with one’s eyes closed is likely to induce sleep. Let’s call this an
“unintended risk,” meaning a risk that consumers fail to appreciate. The
existence of this unintended risk leaves open the possibility of
welfareenhancing regulation. Suppose, for example, that an automatic timer can be
added to the sunlamp at a cost of twenty-five cents, and that manufacturers
have not included this feature because consumers do not anticipate that they
will need it. We do not discuss here the issues raised by the possibility that a
government mandate of the timer interferes with freedom, rightly conceived.
Nor do we address possible distributive issues (all will pay more for
sunlamps, although perhaps only some failed to appreciate the risks of falling
asleep). All we suggest is that an important part of the analysis involves
asking whether the cost of requiring this safety-promoting feature
(twentyfive cents per customer) is less than the cost of the unanticipated burns.

      <p>220. RISK VS. RISK (John D. Graham &amp; Jonathan Baert Wiener eds., 1995). Each of the
solutions stated in the text may also be attractive to conventional economists on a variety of grounds.</p>
      <p>A central point of this example is that from the perspective of behavioral
law and economics, issues of paternalism are to a significant degree
empirical questions, not questions to be answered on an a priori basis. No axiom
demonstrates that people make choices that serve their best interests; this is a
question to be answered based on evidence. Of course the case for
intervention is weakened to the extent that public institutions are likely to make
things worse rather than better. What we are suggesting is that facts, and
assessment of costs and benefits, should replace assumptions that beg the
underlying questions.</p>
      <sec id="sec-23-1">
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>Traditional law and economics is largely based on the standard
assumptions of neoclassical economics. These assumptions are sometimes useful
but often false. People display bounded rationality: They suffer from certain
biases, such as overoptimism and self-serving conceptions of fairness; they
follow heuristics, such as availability, that lead to mistakes; and they behave
in accordance with prospect theory rather than expected utility theory.
People also have bounded willpower; they can be tempted and are sometimes
myopic. They take steps to overcome these limitations. Finally, people are
(fortunately!) boundedly self-interested. They are concerned about the
wellbeing of others, even strangers in some circumstances, and this concern and
their self-conception can lead them in the direction of cooperation at the
expense of their material self-interest (and sometimes spite, also at the expense
of their material self-interest). Most of these bounds can be and have been
made part of formal models.</p>
        <p>In this article we have sketched some of the implications of enriching the
traditional analysis by incorporating a more realistic conception of human
behavior. We have insisted on the value and importance of using the three
bounds in the economic analysis of law; more tentatively, we have explored
a series of legal problems in which the bounds may be significant.
Obviously there is a great deal of research to be done, and one of our principal
goals has been to outline areas that could benefit from further work, both
analytic and empirical.</p>
        <p>We do not doubt that replacing the simple maximizing model of
economics with a more complicated psychological treatment comes at some
cost. Solving optimization problems is usually easier than describing actual
behavior. It has been said (we believe by Herbert Simon) that economics
makes things hard on agents, but easy on economists; behavioral economics,
we suggest, does the opposite. We recapitulate here some of the reasons we
think the enriched model is worth the trouble for those interested in the
economic analysis of law.
1. Some of the predictions of the standard model are simply wrong. For
example, people can be both more spiteful and more cooperative than
traditional analysis predicts, and this matters a great deal to law. It is
also important to know that even in a world without transaction costs and
wealth effects, the assignment of property rights alters the ultimate
allocation of those rights, and that this may be particularly true for certain
forms of property-rights assignment (such as court orders). These
features of the world matter greatly for making predictions and formulating
policy.
2. In other cases economics makes no predictions (or incorrect predictions
of no effect). Prominent in this category are the effects of presentation;
since economic theory assumes that choices are invariant to the manner
in which a problem is framed, it falsely predicts that the language of a
media account or advertisement has no effect on behavior, holding the
information content constant. In contrast, it is well established that
people react differently to potential outcomes depending on whether they are
perceived as foregone gains or out-of-pocket costs (losses), and that they
are likely to think, mistakenly, that salient events are more common than
equally prevalent but more subtle ones. These points bear on the supply
of and the demand for law, and on the behavior of agents in their
interactions with the legal system.
3. Standard economic theories of the content of law are based on an unduly
limited range of potential explanations, namely optimal (or second-best)
rules set by judges and rent-seeking legislation determined by
selfinterested log-rolling. Behavioral economics offers other sources of
potential explanation—most prominently, perceptions of fairness. We have
tried to show that many laws which are seemingly inefficient and do not
benefit powerful interest groups may be explained on grounds of
judgments about right and wrong.</p>
        <p>A behavioral approach to law and economics offers a host of novel
prescriptions regarding how to make the legal system work better. Some
stem from the improved predictions mentioned in point 2 above.
Cognitive difficulties and motivational distortions undermine or alter
conventional economic prescriptions about the jury's role, most notably in the
context of assessing negligence and making other determinations of fact
or law. We have taken some preliminary steps in suggesting ways to
reduce the costs of some of these problems.</p>
        <p>A behavioral approach to law and economics produces new questions
about possible mistakes by private and public actors. On the one hand, it
raises serious doubts about the reflexive antipaternalism of some
economic analysis of law. On the other hand, it raises equivalent questions
about whether even well-motivated public officials will be able to offer
appropriate responses to private mistakes and confusion.</p>
        <p>We hope that this article will encourage others to continue the inquiry
and research, both theoretical and empirical, that will be needed to flesh out
the behavioral approach for which we have argued here. This approach will
use traditional economic tools, enhanced by a better understanding of human
behavior. Thirty years from now, we hope that there will be no such thing as
behavioral economics. Instead we hope that economists and economically
oriented lawyers will simply incorporate the useful findings of other social
sciences, and in so doing, transform economics into behavioral economics,
and economic analysis of law into one of its most important branches.</p>

        <p>This appendix summarizes our framework for behavioral law and
economics. It also lists the law and economics issues we analyze within each
category of the framework. The specific behavioral mechanisms we draw
upon, which are summarized here, do not constitute an exhaustive list of the
mechanisms that might be relevant to law and economics; they simply reflect
the mechanisms we have used here. For each mechanism, we provide a
reference to the literature, as an overview of or entry to the existing research;
we refer the interested reader to the text of our article for additional
