For modern republicans, the task is not simply one of excavation. History does not supply conceptions of political life that can be applied mechanically to current problems. Circumstances change theoretical commitments cannot be wrenched out of context without great risk of distortion contemporary social and legal issues can never be resolved merely through recovery of features, however important and attractive, of the distant past. Difficulties of this sort severely complicate modern efforts to revive principles of classical republicanism.
In addition, much in traditional republican thought gives little cause for celebration. Various strategies of exclusion-of the nonpropertied, blacks, and women-were built into the republican tradition. The republican belief in deliberation about the common good was closely tied to these practices of exclusion it cannot be neatly separated from them. In some of its

manifestations, moreover, the republican tradition has been highly militaristic, indeed heroic-exalting, as the model for public life, the fraternity of soldiers during wartime.' Equally important, the republican belief in the subordination of private interests to the public good carries a risk of tyranny and even mysticism. The belief is also threatening to those who reject the existence of a unitary public good, and who emphasize that conceptions of the good are plural, and dependent on perspective and power.'
In spite of all this, republican theories of politics have a tenacious hold on political actors and observers, inside and outside of the judiciary. The characteristically republican belief in deliberative democracy continues to influence both legal doctrine and contemporary evaluations of the political process. Political advantages are generally sought through appeals to the public good, however cynical and transparent such appeals may sometimes appear.
One of the largest accomplishments of modern historical scholarship has been the illumination of the role of republican thought in the period before, during, and after the ratification of the American Constitution.3 It is no longer possible to see a Lockean consensus in the founding period, or to treat the framers as modern pluralists believing that self-interest is the inevitable motivating force behind political behavior.5 Republican thought played a central role in the framing period, and it offers a powerful conception of politics and of the functions of constitutionalism.
Recent work in law has started to explore the place of republican theory in the American constitutional tradition.6 The republican revival is

now firmly in place, in legal scholarship if not in legal doctrine. The tasks for the immediate future are twofold. The first is to spell out, with some particularity, those aspects of republican thought that have the strongest claim to contemporary support. The second is to describe institutional arrangements and doctrinal shifts, inside and outside the courts, that might serve to implement the most attractive features of the republican vision.
This Article has two principal parts. The first is relatively abstract. Its goal is to outline and defend a particular version of republican thought, one that avoids some of the difficulties associated with competing conceptions of public life, both republican and antirepublican. This version of republicanism, I argue, is not antiliberal at all " it incorporates central features of the liberal tradition. Liberal republicanism is characterized by commitments to four central principles. These principles are related to one another each republican commitment serves to inform and define the others. All of the principles derive from the republican understanding of individual and political freedom. All of them provide distinctive ways of controlling and limiting governmental power. The first principle is deliberation in politics, made possible by what is sometimes described as "civic virtue."' In the deliberative process, private interests are relevant inputs into politics but they are not taken as prepolitical and exogenous and are instead the object of critical scrutiny. The second principle is the equality of political actors, embodied in a desire to eliminate sharp disparities in political participation or influence among individuals or social groups. Economic equality may, but need not, accompany political equality in this sense, as in others, the political process has a degree of autonomy from the private sphere. The third principle is universalism, exemplified by the notion of a common good, and made possible by "practical reason." The republican commitment to universalism, or agreement as a regulative ideal, takes the form of a belief in the possibility of settling at least some normative disputes with substantively right answers. The fourth and final principle is citizenship, manifesting itself in broadly guaranteed rights of participation. Those rights are designed both to control representative behavior and to afford an opportunity to exercise
The Yale Law Journal
and inculcate certain political virtues. Citizenship often occurs in nominally private spheres, but its primary importance is in governmental processes.
The second part of this Article is quite concrete. Its goal is to describe some of the implications of republicanism, thus conceived, for a number of controversies in modern public law. I suggest that republican understandings call for a reformulation of many current legal rules, inside and outside the courts. For example, republican themes would affect governing principles in such contexts as campaign finance regulation, federalism, statutory construction, and discrimination law. Recent proposals for proportional or group representation raise especially interesting issues here. While posing serious risks, such proposals raise important issues about republican theory, and hold out considerable promise. Efforts to ensure group representation can be closely connected both with institutions in the original Constitution and with the republican belief in deliberative democracy. In all of these areas, the tasks of spelling out the contemporary appeal of republican thought, and of exploring its implications for traditional institutional arrangements and legal rights, make it necessary to go well beyond classical republicanism.
American public law might be understood as a set of conflicts among competing conceptions of the nature of American political life. Elements of these conceptions played a role at the time of the framing they continue to influence modern disputes.
A. Pluralism
The first view, which takes both descriptive and normative forms, might be described as pluralist.9 Under this view, politics consists of a struggle among interest groups for scarce social resources. Laws are a kind of commodity, subject to the forces of supply and demand. Various groups in society compete for loyalty and support from citizens. Once they are organized and aligned, they exert pressure on political representatives, who respond, in a market-like manner, to the pressures thus exerted. The ultimate result is political equilibrium.
Beyond the Revival
The pluralist approach takes the existing distribution of wealth, existing background entitlements, and existing preferences as exogenous variables. All of these form a kind of prepolitical backdrop for pluralist struggle." The goal of the system is to ensure that the various inputs are reflected accurately in legislation the system is therefore one of aggregating citizen preferences. This understanding carries with it a particular conception of representation, in which officials respond to constituent desires and exercise little or no independent judgment."1 The appeal of the pluralist understanding-if used normatively-stems from its utilitarian underpinnings, its effort to respect current preferences, and its desire to avoid the risks of tyranny that are associated with active and self-conscious preference-shaping by public officials. The most objectionable exercises of governmental power are often associated with approaches that see character formation as an end of politics. In these respects, pluralism is committed to familiar conceptions of majority rule12 and to a healthy revulsion to regimes that take citizen preferences as an object of collective control. But several risks threaten to undermine a pluralist system. In the aggregate, they suggest that pluralism is an altogether unattractive conception of politics.
1. Bad Preferences and Problems of Unequal Power
The case for pluralism becomes much weaker if some preferences can be shown to be objectionable or the product of unjust background institutions.1 A significant purpose of politics may be to reveal objectionable preferences as such through processes of political discussion and debate.
The Yale Law Journal
Consider laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race or gender. Such laws owe their origin, at least in part, to a perception that the preferences that give rise to discrimination are objectionable or distorted by unjust social institutions. Preferences of that sort may be objectionable because of their effects in subordinating a social group. They may also derive from various distortions, including the phenomenon of adaptive preferences on the part of victims-preferences that are based on the absence of available opportunities. Preferences may be distorted as well by interest-induced beliefs on the part of the beneficiaries of existing practice. A pluralist system is indifferent among preferences, so long as force and fraud are not involved because it disregards the sources and effects of bad preferences, such a system will produce unacceptable results.
The existence of objectionable or distorted preferences suggests that politics should not simply implement citizen desires, but should also allow for a measure of critical distance from and scrutiny of those desires, bringing new information and different perspectives to bear." In this sense, the political sphere should have a degree of autonomy. The difficulties of pluralism in this regard are compounded by the fact that pluralism tends to ignore the power of some groups to limit the number and nature of issues set for democratic resolution, or, most generally, the fact that preferences are formed against the backdrop of disparities in power and limitations in both opportunities and information."
2. Countering "Deals": Deliberation More Generally
The pluralist understanding increases the likelihood of undesirable lawmaking for another reason. Under republican approaches to politics, laws must be supported by argument and reasons they cannot simply be fought for or be the product of self-interested "deals." Private-regarding reasons are an insufficient basis for legislation. Political actors must justify their choices by appealing to a broader public good. This requirement has a
[Vol. 97: 1539
Beyond the Revival
disciplining effect on the sorts of measures that can be proposed and enacted. The requirement of appeal to public-regarding reasons may make it more likely that public-regarding legislation will actually be enacted.2"
The central idea here is that politics has a deliberative or transformative dimension. Its function is to select values, to implement "preferences about preferences,'1 or to provide opportunities for preference formation rather than simply to implement existing desires.23 The point is a quite general one, extending beyond discrimination law to environmental measures, regulation of broadcasting, welfare expenditures, and many other areas. Under the pluralist understanding, there is reason for skepticism about such laws they might appear to be impermissible "rent-seeking," or illegitimate wealth transfers. Indeed, on pluralist assumptions it is unclear why laws should not be bought and sold like commodities in a marketplace such a process of sale might accurately aggregate preferences. But for those who believe in a deliberative function for politics, the marketplace metaphor will be misguided, and laws of these sorts must be understood in nonpluralist terms.
3. Utilitarian Malfunctions
Much of the appeal of pluralism stems from its connection with utilitapolitics is desirable, it is by no means clear that ordinary majoritarianism, understood in pluralist terms, should be accepted.
First, accurate aggregation of preferences through politics is unlikely to be accomplished in light of the conundrums in developing a social welfare function.2 Public choice theory has shown that cycling problems, strategic and manipulative behavior, sheer chance, and other factors prevent majoritarianism from providing an accurate aggregation of preferences. Sec-
The Yale Law Journal
ond, majority rule is indifferent to variations in intensity of preferences,2" and it is fanciful to think that the various supplements to majoritarianism in a pluralist democracy-different levels of participation and financial contribution, for example-will take up the slack.
Even if these problems might be surmounted, one would have to be optimistic indeed to believe that there is an identity between the result that would be reached by the considered utilitarian and that which would be reached by a legislature responding to constituent pressures as they are generally imposed. In any representative democracy, there is simply too much slippage between legislative outcomes and constituent desires. These various considerations converge on a single conclusion: Although pluralist approaches are often defended as a means of ascertaining the "public will," that concept is an incoherent one within pluralist theory.30
Sometimes republicans and others invoke considerations of this sort in order to support constitutional protections against the operation of the public sphere. In particular, some observers, often drawing on public choice theory and purporting to follow Locke, argue in favor of rigid property rights and severe restrictions on collective interference with the existing distribution of wealth and entitlements."' But this strategy disregards the other failings of pluralism. As we will see, it also depends on an undefended belief in a prepolitical or exogenous private sphere, greatly overstates the real-world failings of deliberative government, and ignores the ways in which existing distributions and preferences are a product of law.3
4. Absence of Participation
Pluralist approaches place no premium on political participation. Indeed, for pluralists the absence of political participation is an affirmative good, suggesting general contentment with the status quo and proximity to the equilibrium point.3 Pluralists will therefore be unwilling to take steps
[Vol. 97: 1539
Beyond the Revival
to promote political activity. But the absence of participation may reflect instead a collective action problem"' or an adaptation to practices that are believed intractable and in any case, a system lacking widespread participation will suffer from the failure to cultivate the various qualities that may accompany political life-self-development, feelings of empathy, social solidarity, and so forth.36 One need not believe that the political life is uniquely valuable, or that a system lacking widespread and frequent citizen participation is necessarily oppressive in order to conclude that political activity is often an important individual and collective good.
There is considerable doubt about the descriptive power of pluralist understandings for contemporary political life but it would be hard to deny that elements of pluralism provide a central feature of modern politics. And in light of the multiple failings of pluralism, critics have often pointed to republican conceptions of politics as possible alternatives. Such conceptions appear, at every turn, to oppose pluralist approaches. Aspects of classical republicanism found an American home in the work of the antifederalists and antifederalist thought has exerted a continuing influence on American public law. But elements of republican thought can be found in the views of the federalists as well.
B. The Republican Alternative
Republican conceptions of politics diverge substantially from one another there is no unitary approach that can be described as republican. Classical republicans emphasized the role of the polis as the locus for achieving freedom through active citizenship. On this view, political participants were to subordinate their private interests to the public good through political participation in an ongoing process of collective self-
The Yale Law Journal
determination. Civic virtue was thus a central organizing principle of classical politics.
Many of those in the framing period defined republicanism much more generally, opposing it to monarchy, aristocracy, and despotism. Madison, for example, defined a republic as "a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure, for a limited period, or during good behavior."
Despite the differences among various forms of republicanism, republican theories tend to be united by four central commitments, and in any event it is in these commitments that the contemporary appeal of republican thought can be located. The elaboration of those commitments will be necessarily abstract. It would be possible to describe versions of republicanism that are quite concrete but far less attractive to modern observers and as we will see, the republican commitments, as characterized here, have important implications for a number of controversies in modern public law. All of these commitments are united by the republican conception of individual autonomy as involving selection rather than implementation of ends, and the republican conception of political freedom, which prizes collective self-determination.43
1. Deliberation
Many republican conceptions treat politics as above all deliberative and deliberation is to cover ends as well as means. Although elements of this idea can be found in Aristotle and, even more, in Harrington, the belief in political deliberation is a distinctly American contribution to republican thought."5 The function of politics, on this view, is not simply to implement existing private preferences. Political actors are not supposed to come to the process with preselected interests that operate as exogenous variables. The purpose of politics is not to aggregate private preferences, or to achieve an equilibrium among contending social forces. The republican belief in deliberation counsels political actors to achieve a measure of
[Vol. 97: 1539
Beyond the Revival
critical distance from prevailing desires and practices, subjecting these desires and practices to scrutiny and review.4" To say this is not to suggest that deliberation calls for some standard entirely external to private beliefs and values (as if such a thing could be imagined).47 The republican position is instead that existing desires should be revisable in light of collective discussion and debate, bringing to bear alternative perspectives and additional information. Thus, for example, republicans will attempt to design political institutions that promote discussion and debate among the citizenry they will be hostile to systems that promote lawmaking as "deals" or bargains among self-interested private groups they may well attempt to insulate political actors from private pressure and they may also favor judicial review designed to promote political deliberation and perhaps to invalidate laws when deliberation has
A central point here is that individual preferences should not be taken as exogenous to politics.' They are a function of existing practice, including legal rules such rules cannot, without circularity, be justified by reference to current preferences. As we have seen, private preferences may be a product of adaptation by the disadvantaged" and interest-induced beliefs on the part of the relatively well-off. Republicans are thus unlikely to take existing preferences and entitlements as fixed. Both are permissible objects of political deliberation. In the republican view, for example, the distribution of wealth is a matter for political disposition there is no hostility to redistributive measures. Republicans believe that if used as a term of opprobrium, the notion of "rent-seeking" is badly misdirected.
The republican belief in deliberation is aspirational and critical rather than celebratory and descriptive. It is a basis for evaluating political practices. Modern republicans do not claim that existing systems actually embody republican deliberation. The republican commitments may reveal that actual deliberation, and purportedly deliberative processes, are badly distorted. On the republican view, moreover, the requirement of delibera-
The Yale Law Journal
tion is not purely formal. The antonym of deliberation is the imposition of outcomes by self-interested and politically powerful private groups republicans emphasize that deliberative processes are often undermined by intimidation, strategic and manipulative behavior, collective action problems, adaptive preferences, or-most generally-disparities in political influence. The requirement of deliberation is designed to ensure that political outcomes will be supported by reference to a consensus (or at least broad agreement) among political equals.
Thus understood, the requirement disciplines political outcomes," carrying with it constraints that exclude some results and compel others. The requirement of deliberation embodies substantive limitations that in some settings lead to uniquely correct outcomes.53 Modern examples include the protection of freedom of speech and the prohibition of discrimination against blacks and women.' In this respect, the republican commitment to deliberation is closely allied with the republican beliefs in equality and universalism, taken up below. The commitment to deliberation is particularly controversial to those who believe either that its role is inevitably minimal in modern politics or that even as an aspiration, deliberation, standing by itself, is of little assistance in generating desirable outcomes.
The emphasis on deliberation in republican thought is closely allied with the republican beliefs that the motivating force of political behavior should not be self-interest, narrowly defined, and that civic virtue should play a role in political life. There is no mystery to this claim it refers simply to the understanding that in their capacity as political actors, citizens and representatives are not supposed to ask only what is in their private interest, but also what will best serve the community in general 5'-understood as a response to the best general theory of social welfare. Thus understood, the requirement accommodates a wide range of possible positions but it is a constraint nonetheless. Sometimes the appeal to civic virtue is designed to improve individual character-a particularly important theme in classical republican thought. But modern republicans
(Vol. 97: 1539
Beyond the Revival
invoke civic virtue primarily in order to promote deliberation in the service of social justice, not to elevate the character of the citizenry.
Republican approaches are often said to be antagonistic to private rights -an understanding traceable to the fact that republicans see the private sphere as the product of public decisions, and deny the existence of natural or prepolitical entitlements. Republican theories are not, however, hostile to the protection of individual or group autonomy from state control. Indeed, legal rights have quite consistently accompanied republican systems.57 What is distinctive about the republican view is that it understands most rights as either the preconditions for or the outcome of an undistorted deliberative process.5 Thus, for example, the principle of deliberation argues in favor of liberty of expression and conscience and the right to vote these are the basic preconditions for republican deliberation. Liberal systems could be, and have in fact been, founded on premises of this sort but understandings that point to prepolitical or natural rights"0 are entirely foreign to republicanism. On the republican point of view, the existence of realms of private autonomy must be justified in public terms.
The difference is illustrated by different approaches to private property. Republicans have historically believed in the importance of property rights as a shield against the state and as a guarantor of security, independence, and virtue.6" Modern-day republicans might well share that view but because of the republican emphasis on the social construction of property rights, republicans are hardly hostile to redistribution or to collective efforts to reassess the existing distribution of wealth and entitlements.6 Indeed, because of the republican emphasis on the social conditions for republican deliberation, republican commitments point powerfully in the direction of equalizing political influence-a point to which I now turn.
The Yale Law Journal
2. Political Equality Many republican writers have placed a high premium on political equality. Political equality, in republican terms, is understood as a requirement that all individuals and groups have access to the political process large disparities in political influence are disfavored. Republicans are likely to be highly receptive, for example, to measures designed to reduce the effects of wealth in the political process6 or to furnish access to the media.6" On at least some versions of the pluralist conception of politics, such measures point in exactly the wrong directions. Government is inevitably the enemy of freedom of expression the distribution of private power is off limits to politics.6 By contrast, many republican writers emphasized the close connection between republican systems and economic equality. Dramatic differences in wealth and power are, in this view, inconsistent with the underlying premises of a republican polity. Montesquieu was particularly insistent on this point, envisioning equality as a necessary precondition for republicanism. Even for republicans who accept a large degree of economic inequality, sharp disparities in political influence are a severe source of concern.
[Vol. 97: 1539
Beyond the Revival
Some of the American antifederalists emphasized the threats of commercialism and argued in favor of material equality. Thus Centinel wrote that a "republican, or free government, can only exist where the body of the people are virtuous, and where property is pretty equally divided in such a government the people are the sovereign and their sense or opinion is the criterion of every public measure for when this ceases to be the case, the nature of the government is changed, and an aristocracy, monarchy or despotism will rise on its ruin." Thus Cato wrote that "Dominion follows Property . An Equality of Estate will give an Equality of Power and an Equality of Power is a Commonwealth, or Democracy," and feared that "Very great Riches in private Men . destroy that Balance of Property and Power, which is necessary to a Democracy. Captain Welton claimed that for a popular or democratic system "an equal distribution of property was necessary. It should not be surprising that a disproportionate number of those in favor of paper money and debtor relief legislation fell within the antifederalist camp.
The republican belief in political equality is itself highly controversial, as the debate over campaign finance regulation reveals.73 The notion that political equality depends on economic equality is even more so, and has hardly been shared by all republican theorists."4 But many of the American framers, including Madison, expressed concern about both political and economic inequality.
The Yale Law Journal
3. Universalism: Agreement as a Regulative Ideal Republican thought is characterized by a belief in universalism, a term that I will use in a somewhat idiosyncratic sense. The republican commitment to universalism amounts to a belief in the possibility of mediating different approaches to politics, or different conceptions of the public good, through discussion and dialogue. The process of mediation is designed to produce substantively correct outcomes, understood as such through the ultimate criterion of agreement among political equals. It is because of the belief in universalism that republican approaches posit the existence of a common good, to be found at the conclusion of a well-functioning deliberative process." Republicans thus reject ethical relativism and skepticism, and believe that different perspectives are sometimes subject to mediation both in theory and in the real world. The institutional consequence is that republicans will be hostile to bargaining mechanisms in the political process and will instead seek to ensure agreement among political participants. The republican belief in agreement as a regulative ideal, and the republican conception of political truth, are pragmatic in character. They do not depend on a belief in ultimate foundations for political outcomes.7
Under pluralist assumptions, the notion of a common good is alternatively mystical or tyrannical.8" Republican theories, on the other hand,
[Vol. 97: 1539
Beyond the Revival
rely on the deliberative functions of politics and on practical reason," and embrace the notion of the common good as a coherent one. To some degree this belief depends on a commitment to political empathy, embodied in a requirement that political actors attempt to assume the position of those who disagree. Political outcomes are, on this view, not limited to the achievement of Pareto improvements or to the supply of collective goods. Measures that attempt to select and pronounce values-embodied in, for example, broadcasting regulation, environmental measures, or antidiscrimination law-attest to the republican belief in universalism. Such measures represent the outcome of a deliberative process among political equals they do not take existing preferences and practices as exogenous.
To say this is not to suggest that republicans believe in a unitary public good, or that they deny that differently situated individuals and groups will frequently be unable to resolve their disagreements through conversation.8 Sometimes compromises are necessary "" sometimes there will be political losers some issues-religion is a familiar example-should be entirely off-limits to politics. It would be fanciful to suggest that different conceptions of the good life can or should always be mediated through politics. The republican position is not that every issue is subject to political resolution it is instead that some questions can yield general agreement through deliberation. A conception of politics that disregards this fact will be doomed to repeat the failings of pluralism.
4. Citizenship
Republican approaches place a high premium on citizenship and participation,88 and thus seek mechanisms both for citizen control of national
The Yale Law Journal
institutions and for decentralization, local control, and local self-determination. A large purpose of participation is to monitor the behavior of representatives in order to limit the risks of factionalism and self-interested representation. But on the republican view, political participation is not only instrumental in the ordinary sense it is also a vehicle for the inculcation of such characteristics as empathy, virtue, and feelings of community87 (and this is so even if the motivation for participation is instrumental"'). The belief in citizenship is part of the republican antipathy to certain versions of political individualism. It repudiates approaches that place no premium on political participation as an independent good republicans therefore attempt to provide outlets for the exercise of citizenship. According to the antifederalists, for example, representation was at best a necessary evil, and its risks were to be limited by ensuring that public officials would be tightly controlled by the citizenry. It was for this reason that in evaluating the institutions of the proposed Constitution, the antifederalists were least suspicious of the House of Representatives and regarded the President and the judiciary with most alarm the Senate was an intermediate
Allied with this idea is the familiar belief that republican systems should be small and decentralized. A large republic threatens to diminish the connection between rulers and ruled and decrease opportunities for participation. "[T]he civic humanist ideal had originated in a re-assertion of the vita activa, and it was the ultimate goal of the citizen to assert his virtue in action, of which the republic was the frame."9 A large republic would thus tend to produce corruption, the greatest obstacle to a wellfunctioning republican system. Moreover, and equally important, the republican belief in deliberation about the common good is most easily sustained when there is homogeneity and agreement about foundations. Where such agreement is entirely absent, deliberative processes may break down."1 A belief in decentralization and a fear of the diversity of a large republic naturally accompany this concern. This point raises important difficulties for efforts to revive republican thought in a large and heterogeneous nation. At the same time, traditional republican thought was hostile to com-
[Vol. 97: 1539
Beyond the Revival
merce and luxury.92 Commercial development tends, in this view, to produce avarice and to weaken the attachment to the public good on which republican systems depend. Other forms of republicanism approach commerce quite differently, regarding it as a means of achieving cordial relations among potential adversaries and thus of softening social tensions.9"
The four basic republican principles are closely related to one another. For example, the commitment to political equality is allied with the belief in deliberation. The norm of equality constrains both inputs and outputs of the deliberative process particular groups may not be excluded from the process, and results that subordinate politically weak groups are proscribed.94 The belief in universalism and agreement as a regulative ideal is a natural consequence of the republican faith in deliberation and political equality. Citizenship is a predicate for political deliberation, and the norm of political equality has consequences for the desirable forms of citizenship. The various republican commitments thus help to qualify and inform each other.
The commitments are in turn traceable to the republican conception of individual and political freedom. On this view, individual freedom consists not in the implementation but instead in the selection of ends.9 Such a process emphasizes the existence of second-order preferences,9 the value of overcoming weakness of the will, the possibility that private ends have been distorted by unjust social institutions, and the importance of increasing available opportunities and information. The republican commitment to political freedom is a generalization of these ideas. Although alert to possible malfunctions in the governmental process, republicans envision that process as a forum in which alternative perspectives and additional information are brought to bear, problems are occasionally revealed to be systemic rather than individual,99 second-order preferences may be vindi-
The Yale Law Journal
cated, and collective action problems and weakness of the will may be overcome. As we will see, these ideas have powerfully influenced the liberal tradition as well.
C. American Constitutionalism
There can be little doubt that elements of both pluralist and republican thought played a role during the period of the constitutional framing. John Adams, for example, was at times quite skeptical about the idea that anything other than self-interest could be the basis for political behavior.101 Noah Webster wrote that "the system of the great Montesquieu" might be improved by removing the word "virtue" whenever it appears in The Spirit of Laws and replacing it with "property or lands in fee simple."102 Patrick Henry said that the "real rock of political salvation is selflove, perpetuated from age to age in every human breast, and manifested
More important, much of Madison's own work, most notably Federalist No. 10, reflects skepticism about important elements of classical republican thought. Thus Madison believed that a small republic would be torn by factional warfare, endangering both private rights and the public good.10 Hamilton expressed similar views. Indeed, central features of the framers' thought consisted of fears about the consequences of decentralization and widespread citizen participation, " lack of enthusiasm for material equality,107 belief in the social and economic advantages of a commercial republic, and a thoroughly modern recognition that self-interest is often the mainspring of political behavior. In such ideas one can find a rejection of central features of traditional republicanism.
At the same time, there can be little doubt that elements of republican thought played an important role in the framing period. For example,
[Vol. 97: 1539
Beyond the Revival
the framers did not abandon the traditional republican belief in deliberative government and the need for civic virtue. First, and probably foremost, the framers stressed that their system was likely to attract and produce representatives who would have the virtue associated with republican citizens. Above all, Madison's conception of representation incorporated important features of traditional republican thought. Thus The Federalist No. 10 emphasized the capacity of a large republic to obtain public-spirited representatives, operating above the fray of constituent pressures. Madison wrote that in a large republic, representation would "refine and enlarge the public views by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations."
The belief in deliberative representation led to particular enthusiasm for indirect elections. In describing the electoral process, Madison argued that state legislatures should choose "those men only who have become the most distinguished by their abilities and virtue." And Publius expressed particular enthusiasm for the President, suggesting "a constant probability" that the presidency would be filled by characters "preeminent for ability and virtue." Significantly, the electoral college was to be a deliberative body. And in a remarkable series of debates after the founding, early Congresses rejected a constitutional amendment that would entitle constituents to "instruct" their representatives about how to vote. In those debates, Madison and others made it clear that the representatives' task called for deliberation, and that task was inconsistent with a right to instruct.11
The Yale Law Journal
The framers' conception of representation, in short, incorporated the traditional republican faith in the value of virtue and deliberation in politics, with an accompanying belief in agreement of a regulative Madisonian republicanism calls for substantial autonomy on the part of representatives. They are charged not with implementing what their constituents "want," though that is of course relevant the deliberative task requires a measure of independence. Thus Madison favored large election districts and long length of service, in order both to limit factionalism by separating representatives from constituents and to encourage deliberation on the general good. Thus it was that the framers had especially high hopes for the Presidency and the Senate, showed little fear of an insulated judiciary, and were modest in their expectations for the House of Representatives-precisely the reverse of the expectations and fears of the antifederalists.1
But classical republican thought did not have its exclusive locus in the Madisonian conception of representation. The act of creating a Constitution was itself supposed to depend on the capacity of the public as a whole to behave in the common interest. The decision to write and accept a Constitution serving the long-term interest called for a large degree of republican virtue and that decision involved the citizenry in general."'
The framers stressed more generally the need for virtue among the citizenry as a whole. Thus in the Virginia Ratifying Convention, Madison stated: "I go on this great republican principle, that the people will have virtue and intelligence to select men of virtue and wisdom. Is there no virtue among us? If there be not, we are in a wretched situation. No theoretical checks, no form of government, can render us secure. To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without
[Vol. 97: 1539
Beyond the Revival
any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea. If there be sufficient virtue and intelligence in the community, it will be exercised in the selection of these men so that we do not depend on their virtue, or put confidence in our rulers, but in the people who are to choose them."' Even more strikingly, Madison suggested that republican government calls for more virtue from the citizenry than "any other form.""" In this sense, the very belief in virtuous representation resulted from some optimism about the citizenry.
What emerged is in several respects a hybrid. A number of elements competed in the theory of politics embodied in the American Constitution. First, the framers' conception of human nature synthesized elements of classical republicanism with its emerging interest-group competitor. Thus Publius wrote that "[tihe supposition of universal venality in human nature is little less an error in political reasoning than the supposition of universal rectitude."" In the same vein, he claimed that "[a]s there is a degree of depravity in mankind which requires a certain degree of circumspection and distrust, so there are other qualities in human nature, which justify a certain portion of esteem and confidence."' In these respects, purely pluralist readings of the founding period ' are badly off the mark.
Second, the federalist conception of representation steered a middle course between Burkean and pluralist approaches. A critical feature of the thought of the founding period is a belief in the deliberative capacities of representatives and the need to insulate public officials from constituent pressures in order to promote the performance of their deliberative tasks. At the same time, however, the framers were well aware of the need to ensure a measure of accountability to the public, and thus they built into the system mechanisms of electoral control.'
Third, the base institutions of the Constitution-checks and balances, bicameralism, federalism, and legal rights-continued the fusion of republican and pluralist elements. The system of checks and balances permitted "ambition . . . to counteract ambition" thus The Federalist No. 51 suggests that self-interest will be channeled in such a way as to protect the citizenry as a whole. Checks and balances would also increase the likelihood of deliberation in government. The requirement of agreement among
The Yale Law Journal
the three branches would operate as a check on factionalism and selfinterested representation, on instability, and on the risk that government would seek a particular course without having fully considered the consequences.
Similarly, the federal system was designed to ensure that "[t]he differoperate to protect the citizenry against government invasions. At the same time, the federal system would guarantee an arena for citizen self-determination and promote diversity and responsiveness. The considerable role for the states provided a locus in which to satisfy the traditional republican belief in small republics. To be sure, much of federalist thought was based on a rejection of the traditional republican belief in local democracies but the Constitution that emerged furnished a secure place for selfdetermination through the federal system, supplementing and complementing national institutions. Moreover, the systems of checks and balances, bicameralism, and federalism responded to the central republican understanding that disagreement can be a creative force.' National institutions were set up so as to ensure a measure of competition and dialogue the federal system would produce both experimentation and mutual controls. In all of these ways, the constitutional framework created a kind of deliberative democracy, including Madisonian representation at the national level, safeguards against factionalism and self-interested representation, and opportunities for local self-determination through the federal system.'1 The rights created by the Constitution share similar ambiguities. Many of the original constitutional rights provide spheres of private autonomy to be insulated from government interference such rights can be justified in republican fashion, but some of them are more easily understood as an outgrowth of Lockean ideas. Other rights can be read as straightforwardly republican in inspiration. The right to a jury trial is a good example
[Vol. 97: 1539
Beyond the Revival
the right to protection against takings of private property can be understood in both pluralist and republican terms." The right to assembly falls in this category as well.
In a number of respects, then, the American constitutional tradition was influenced at its inception by features of republican thought. But it is not immediately clear why this fact should matter to contemporary constitutional controversies. Questions about the future of American constitutionalism might be approached straightforwardly as issues of political theory. The emphasis on republican and pluralist elements in the founding period would, under this view, be treated as a species of ancestor worship, carrying with it many of the risks of reliance on the framers' intent to solve constitutional problems. Use of Madison might be justified if Madison's thought turns out to be helpful but his status as a constitutional founder would be beside the point. Madison's views would, in this understanding, carry no more weight than those of, say, Hegel.
But the importance of Madison for current constitutional controversy does not depend solely on the quality of Madison's thought. The fact that the American constitutional regime at its outset owed a great deal to republican thought is an important corrective to approaches that purport to speak for the American constitutional tradition, but proceed from pluralist premises... or invoke prepolitical rights." Decisions about the nature and direction of a constitutional democracy cannot be made in the abstract and acontextually they must appeal to reasons. Interpretation of the meaning of the relevant tradition is always an important method of social criticism ' an understanding of inherited beliefs is an inevitable part of the project of constitutionalism. The future of American public law depends in significant part on the way that its tradition is understood-a theme highly congenial to republicanism. And the republican elements of the framers' thought deserve credit for helping to launch many reforms that were in retrospect highly desirable.
To say this is not to insist that American public law would have to adhere to republican thought if republicanism were without contemporary relevance or appeal. Other aspects of the thought of the founding period-its incorporation of Calvinism, for example, and of slavery and racism' 35-should not be revived even if historians were able to show the
The Yale Law Journal
tenacity of those commitments during and after the framing period. But the presence of a historical pedigree, one that has accomplished considerable good, adds force to the case for a republican revival.
II. A. A Catalogue I have presented a set of commitments with which republicanism is often associated. But republican thought has had numerous manifestations, and there are large divergences among them. In its most classical versions, republican thought drew a sharp distinction between public and private interests, and saw in public life an opportunity to abandon or subordinate private interests in order to promote the public good. Such understandings draw the most rigid of distinctions between private interests and public good " prepolitical differences are an inadmissible basis for resolution of political controversy. Understandings of this kind depend on an expectation that citizens should entirely abandon their private identities when they come to politics. This expectation," built on an understandable desire to ensure against the distortion of politics by interest, is of course unrealistic. But the difficulty goes deeper. The notion that, for example, disadvantaged groups must put their interests to one side in the political process hardly seems likely to lead to just outcomes. Universalism ought not to be understood as a desire to obliterate social differences in politics. Deliberation is undermined, not promoted, by an expectation that differently situated individuals and groups will say the same thing.
In other forms, republican thought is militaristic and heroic, associating political behavior with warfare, and valuing in politics the characteristics prized during times of battle.1 Political life is in this formulation approved as a means of escaping the routine of ordinary life and obtaining a species of immortality. Here one can see the close association, both metaphorical and literal, between republican thought and militarism, and at several levels. It is in times of war that republican virtue, understood in this fashion, is most powerfully displayed it is war that tends to unite the citizenry in dedication to the public good and it is war that might serve as the model, even in times of peace, for the subordination of private interests to the general good. The use of metaphors of that sort, as a device for
[Vol. 97: 1539
Beyond the Revival
rallying and unifying the citizenry, is familiar in modern political life.1" But efforts to assimilate politics to war will often lead in undesirable directions.
In addition, classical republicanism was comfortable with firm social hierarchies, placed a large emphasis on the role of tradition, and was sometimes built on organic conceptions of the state that found common interests among members of different social classes. Understandings of this sort are of course incompatible with modern beliefs in eliminating (at least some) status hierarchies indeed, they coexist awkwardly with the republicans' own commitment to political equality.
Other forms of republicanism are highly rationalistic, even Cartesian. Here the emphasis on deliberation is designed to enable citizens to transcend bodily drives, to eliminate affective ties or empathy, and to ensure the dominance of reason, narrowly understood, in politics.1 Forms of republican thought that value militarism and the overcoming of physical drives, and that devalue the private sphere as part of "nature," are often accompanied by misogyny.1 The exclusion of women from politics, a familiar part of republican regimes, is an outgrowth of ideas of this sort. But an understanding that attempts to eliminate affective ties, or even anger, from the political process will likely be self-defeating, and in any case will lead in undesirable directions. Thus other versions of republican thought are far less Cartesian and also attempt to develop conceptions of politics unaffected by gender and other unjust hierarchies.1 Some modern forms of republicanism furnish no sharp split between public and private interests, and attempt to channel self-interest in such a way as to promote the common good.1
The Yale Law Journal
B. Liberal Republicanism Much of recent writing on constitutional history has focused on a supposed tension between liberalism and republicanism. 4" The basic claim here is that before the framing of the Constitution, republican principles predominated. The framing period reflected a conflict between the two ideologies, out of which liberalism emerged victorious after the Constitution was enacted, the nation entered into a period of liberalism in which republican principles played at most a subordinate role.""8 There is considerable dispute about the precise extent and timing of the victory of liberalism over republicanism,'4 but this basic chronology captures much of the current historical consensus. The position has something to be said in its favor. Some forms of liberal thought are inconsistent with the basic tenets of republicanism. They see freedom only as protection from the public sphere limit the role of government to the prevention of force and fraud regard existing preferences and entitlements as exogenous to politics place little premium on political or economic equality downplay the role of deliberation and virtue and view the protection of individual self-interest, narrowly defined, as the goal of the state.'8 Views of this sort are at the opposite pole of the republicanism found, for example, in Benjamin Rush, and Rush's views conflict with the species of republicanism outlined here.' The hierarchical characteristics of classical republicanism are also in severe tension with liberal thought, which places a premium on individual capacity to break out of traditional roles.
Moreover, antifederalist thought was united, albeit somewhat loosely, by fears of commercial development, belief in civic virtue, and desire for equality and local self-determination. On all of these scores, their federalist opponents were sharp opponents.' There can be no doubt that the basic program of the federalists was ultimately vindicated.
[Vol. 97: 1539

The opposition between liberal and republican thought in the context of the framing is, however, largely a false one. Only through a caricature of the tradition154 can liberalism be thought to be the antonym of the species of republicanism that operated during the constitutional period. The caricature singles out relatively marginal species of liberalism-possessive individualism or modern neo-Lockeanism-and treats them as representative and central. But most of the great liberal thinkers did not take interests as prepolitical. Indeed, they placed a high premium on deliberation and discussion,ES and on the capacity of political dialogue to improve outcomes and to undermine unjustified disparities in power. It is a similarly large mistake to suggest that liberal thinkers believed that threats lay only in government intrusions and that there was no right to protection from private power. Liberal thinkers have been alert to the threats posed by both public and private power and have sought to design systems to limit both threats.1 It should not be forgotten that the original purpose of the social contract was to redistribute security.15 Certain aspects of Rawls' A Theory ofJustice speak powerfully for these features of the liberal tradition, and embody much of the contemporary appeal of republican thought.16
Some elements of the liberal tradition are highly congenial to republican conceptions of politics. In their emphasis on the possibility of forming public policy through deliberation, on political equality, on citizenship,
The Yale Law Journal
and on the salutary effects of publicity, republicanism and liberalism are as one. All four of the basic republican commitments find a home within the liberal tradition. In both systems, moreover, a requirement of neutrality or impersonality,"" meant in a particular way, plays an important role. The notion of neutrality is easily misunderstood, and criticism of the notion has become quite fashionable. Such criticisms are justified when the notion is based on an unarticulated substantive theory that denies its status as such,16 implies unreflective preservation of the existing set of preferences or the existing distribution of wealth and entitlements, or suggests the possibility of developing an elaborate social theory without making value choices.1 But the notion seems more plausible if it is understood more modestly as requiring (a) that certain considerations not be taken into account and (b) that political actors offer public-regarding justifications for social outcomes, or for deviations from ordinary norms. The requirement of abstraction from certain considerations-like religion or political affiliation-is the most familiar example of the first requirement much of constitutional law is a product of the second."6
On this view, republican neutrality calls for the consistent application of the correct substantive theory, or even the consistent application of the speaker's own substantive theory. This idea is closely associated with the republican belief in political equality. The requirement of consistency or generalization that lies at the heart of notions of neutrality is a prominent equal protection principle. The degree of constraint imposed by this requirement is of course a controversial and difficult question but it would be a large mistake to abandon the idea altogether, or to attempt to eliminate its antonym, partiality or bias. If such notions were eliminated, similar ideas would undoubtedly arise with slightly different verbal formulations. Consider the idea that theories of moral development are partial because they are based on male models, or that much of the law of sex discrimination embodies a male referent.
[Vol. 97: 1539

In both liberal and republican systems, moreover, self-interest is an insufficient basis for political outcomes. In both systems, "rights" are not prepolitical givens, but the products (sometimes given constitutional status) of a well-functioning deliberative process. In both systems, social justice requires one "not to be a disembodied nobody," but instead to attempt "to think from the point of view of everybody." The most collectivist forms of republican thought1 are of course at odds with the most atomistic versions of liberalism republican thinkers who endorse traditional hierarchies reject the liberal emphasis on political and social freedom for the individual but in numerous respects republicanism and liberalism are hardly antonyms. Republican thought, understood in a certain way, is a prominent aspect of the liberal tradition.
The elaboration and defense of liberal republicanism is a large task indeed, but it is possible to describe some of the sources of its appeal. Liberal republicanism is responsive to an understanding of freedom as including critical distance from and scrutiny of ends. Republican thought treats this as a plausible conception of both individual and collective freedom it sees political liberty in collective self-determination ' while it does not regard political participation as the sole good life for human beings, it attempts to provide outlets for citizen control and local selfdetermination.
At the same time, liberal republicans are fearful of public power, and impose numerous constraints on the operation of the public sphere. Both private rights and institutional arrangements are understood, however, as the outcome of a well-functioning deliberative process. Liberal republicanism is simultaneously responsive to possible abuses of both public and private power it understands that the private sphere is constituted by public decisions, but treats that unsurprising insight as a reason for preservation rather than obliteration of constraints on government. Liberal republicanism attempts to limit disparities in political influence among various groups, including blacks and whites and rich and poor. In this respect, American republicanism must be understood not only in terms of the framing period, with its occasional strategies of exclusion, but also in terms of the Civil War amendments and the New Deal, with their more inclusionary approaches to public life. Endorsing the modern belief in individual rights, liberal republicanism is able to incorporate powerful and widely-held conceptions of both freedom and equality. And it is antagonistic to approaches that see politics as a replication of the existing distribu-
The Yale Law Journal
tion of social power, that take existing preferences for granted or downplay the deliberative functions of politics, and that deny the possibility of mediating social disputes in ways that are generally acceptable.
To outline these points, or to suggest that political actors should "think from the point of view of everybody," is not sharply to limit the category of permissible approaches, let alone to solve particular problems. A large task for the future is to be quite concrete about the consequences of republicanism, properly understood, for social theory and legal reform. That task has three components. The first is to generate the appropriate device, or standpoint, from which to develop principles of social justice the second is to describe those principles, having carried out the first task the third is to describe institutions and rights with which to implement the relevant principles.
A number of prominent efforts draw on one or more of the principles to which republicanism is committed. Thus utilitarian understandings, committed to universalism, attempt self-consciously to take account of everyone's point of view.""' Other theories, making deliberation and political equality central, attempt to derive substantive constraints from the ideas of neutral dialogue1 and undistorted communication.17 Rawls' own approach of course relies on the original position, attempting to ensure that those developing principles of justice are not influenced by factors that are
It would be foolish to attempt in this space to evaluate these various approaches, which, for all their diversity, overlap in important ways with liberal republicanism as set out here. From the republican standpoint, however, some of the difficulties in these approaches are apparent. In many forms, utilitarian understandings take existing preferences as exogenous variables-an approach entirely foreign to republicanism. Moreover, on republican grounds it is unclear that "neutrality" among competing conceptions of the good life is always desirable even if it were possible for governmental institutions' to achieve it. It is also quite doubtful that the notion of neutrality, at least as understood by some, can generate powerful substantive constraints on political outcomes.181 Enor-
[Vol. 97: 1539

mous work is necessary to unpack the notion of "distortion" in communication and to explain its role in developing theories of social justice." Standing by itself, the concept depends on a highly ambiguous ideal case.
For republicans, the problem with the original position as a guide to political institutions or as a political ideal18 is that it is too solitary and insufficiently dialogic. The task for political actors is to generate institutions that will produce deliberation among those differently situated, not to mimic the decisions that would be made by the unsituated-a problem taken up below.
We may therefore suggest that the basic republican commitments will tend in the direction of guarantees of political deliberation, including the basic rights of political participation the republican beliefs in political equality and citizenship will generate strong antidiscrimination norms republicanism is likely as well to furnish basic guarantees of security, in the form of both private property and minimum welfare entitlements and republican approaches will attempt to promote deliberation among multiple voices in the political process.
C. Antirepublicanism
In all of its various forms, republican conceptions of politics have been subject to vigorous criticism. Some observers have suggested that the belief in deliberative government is romantic and anachronistic-incompatible with the inevitably self-interested character of modern political life." In this view, efforts to ensure civic virtue on the part of citizens and representatives are simply impractical-a diversion from more promising strategies for reform. A related objection would suggest that deliberation is purely formal, imposing no substantive constraints on political outcomes on this view, any such constraints are the product of something other than deliberation.
Others stress the dangers of totalitarianism that are built into the traditional republican belief in the subordination of private interests to the common good.185 Consider in this regard Benjamin Rush's suggestion that each citizen
should be taught that he does not belong to himself, but that he is
public property. Let him be taught to love his family, but let him be

taught at the same time that he must forsake and even forget them tions that have been made it is plain that I consider it as possible to convert men into republican machines. This must be done if we expect them to perform their parts properly in the great machine of the government of the state.1"'
In the same vein, Rousseau suggested that the "newly-born infant, upon first opening his eyes, must gaze upon the fatherland, and until his dying day should behold nothing else."' Such understandings of republicanism allow and indeed encourage the imposition of a comprehensive view of social life on the nation as a whole.188 From this point of view, interestgroup pluralism seems quite attractive in its willingness to allow pursuit of divergent conceptions of the good. Pluralism understood in quite another sense-as respect for diverse social groups, public and private, living different lives-appears to be an especially desirable alternative.
Some of the most interesting criticisms of republican theories have come from those who have little sympathy for interest-group pluralism as it is conventionally understood. The basic point here is that some of the central notions of republican politics-deliberative politics, universalism, and citizenship-ignore the persistence of differences and oppositions among groups in society. In a large and diverse nation, there is no common good to be mediated through discussion there is no unitary political truth there are instead irreducibly opposed perspectives and interests. In this view, the problem of modern politics is emphatically not that political actors have been disabled from bringing prepolitical interests to the process.
Above all, social groups-especially the disadvantaged-should not, in this view, be prevented from invoking their private interests in the political process. A central purpose of political discourse is to enable such groups to bring about reform by doing precisely that. The conception of a civic public thus depends on a denial of difference and a belief in transcendence of context-unrealistic aspirations that threaten to forestall desirable change. An approach to politics that seeks to remove such issues from politics, to operate on the basis of a myth of commonness, and to remove prepolitical interests, leads in unproductive directions. What, in such a system, will politics be about? '
This view stresses the difficulties of basing a modern political system on beliefs in deliberation, common good, and universalism. A related problem with republican understandings is that they put a high premium on delib-
[Vol. 97: 1539
Beyond the Revival
eration through public processes and through the state, and undervalue the need for intermediate organizations, often nominally private, that serve both as checks on government and as arenas for the cultivation and expression of republican virtues.' The most powerful statement of this position can be found in Tocqueville.'
Citizenship, understood in republican fashion, does not occur solely through official organs. Many organizations-including labor unions, religious associations, women's groups of various sorts, civil rights organizations, volunteer and charitable groups, and others, sometimes marking themselves outside of and in opposition to conventional society-serve as outlets for some of the principal functions of republican systems. These functions include the achievement of critical scrutiny of existing practices, the provision of an opportunity for deliberation within collectivities, the chance to exercise citizenship and to obtain a sense of community, and the exercise of civic virtue, understood as the pursuit of goals other than selfinterest, narrowly conceived. The problem with at least some forms of republicanism is that they tend to ignore or devalue groups of this sort. What is needed, on this view, is a more differentiated approach to the relationship between citizen and state than that afforded by republican theories.
Antirepublicans of this sort do not rely on possessive individualism, and they are at pains to distinguish themselves from pluralists. Many of them are dissatisfied with the existing distribution of resources and opportunities. Interest-group deals, under the pluralist conception, are no more attractive to them than to republicans, and for the same reasons they simply replicate the existing distribution of social power. But there is considerable overlap between the view of antirepublicans of this sort and that of the pluralists. In both approaches, interests are seen as largely exogenous and prepolitical in both, politics in governmental processes is a matter of selfinterests, and largely of deals in both, it is normal and legitimate for political actors to seek goods or opportunities solely on the ground that it is in their interest to do so in both, there is reason for considerable suspicion about the state, and in particular about measures that purport to reflect a unitary public good in both, spheres of individual and group autonomy are highly valued in both, the notion of mediation among conflicting conceptions of the good seems fanciful. The republican belief in a disjunction between prepolitical interests and political behavior is the principal object of attack as an ideal that is both unrealistic and undesirable.
These challenges to republican approaches correctly emphasize the im-
The Yale Law Journal
portance of private association and the difficulties in some conceptions of universalism. The task of incorporating into republican theories the need for intermediate organizations to be insulated from the state is a large and critical one. But antirepublicanism of this sort carries serious risks as well. Intermediate organizations serve a variety of important functions, but recognition of that point does not eliminate the need to describe the appropriate role of the state and national governments. One must, in short, explain what it is that the government should do, and here the reference to intermediate organizations is inadequate.
This is so for two principal reasons. First, an approach that sees the locus of republican virtues exclusively in private institutions undervalues the distinctive capacities of the state. In view of those capacities, political deliberation and citizenship must occur within public institutions as well. It should be a familiar point that the government is uniquely able to undertake a wide range of tasks, including (for example) the elimination of discrimination, the regulation of broadcasting, and the protection of the environment. Tasks of that sort cannot be undertaken entirely by private actors.
Second, multiple threats are posed by private power, including that wielded by intermediate organizations, which are themselves a source of oppression.' Government must therefore play a role in limiting the powers of such organizations " without denying the importance of their continued existence. A system that allowed intermediate organizations to proceed without regulation would lead to intolerable results.
The unifying theme of antirepublican arguments is an attack on the ideals of universalism and impartiality the relevant arguments stress the importance of situatedness and perspective, but it is here that the attack is itself most vulnerable. Properly understood, the principle of universalism' does not deny the existence of different perspectives, and it does not assert that political participants must put their private complaints to one side when they come to politics. The belief in universalism affirms instead that some perspectives are better than others, and that that claim can be vindicated through discussion with those initially skeptical. Republican theories do not claim that there is a standpoint unsituated in the world they do not impose a particular, parochial perspective in the guise of neu-
[Vol. 97: 1539
Beyond the Revival
trality. Instead they require public-regarding justifications offered after multiple points of view have been consulted and (to the extent possible) genuinely understood.1 Such an approach is the foundation of contemporary republicanism. It is for this reason that republican conceptions treat an understanding of the partiality of one's own perspective as a regulative ideal for politics, and are highly suspicious of approaches that see prepolitical interests as the exclusive determinants of political participation.
The antirepublican critique rejects this approach as unrealistic and misguided. But the categories to which it refers and the commitments that it embodies are highly likely to reflect republican understandings. For example, spheres of autonomy for individuals and groups must be defended on some ground they cannot be justified as prepolitical and if the defense is to be persuasive, it will have to incorporate republican notions of deliberation and universalism. Indeed, the very conception of a disadvantaged group-central to some attacks on republican notions of universalism-depends on a commitment to an understanding of what disadvantage amounts to, and a belief that the understanding can be vindicated through discussion with those initially skeptical. The antirepublican critique, like many arguments of this sort, "can give no account of the normative foundations of its own rhetoric."1' Arguments that reject universalism tend to disable themselves from supporting their own descriptive and normative commitments arguments that reject neutrality eliminate a possible source of argument that is not only strategically useful, but an accurate description of what is sometimes at work.
Republicans do not insist that political actors must forget their private concerns, or that differences and disagreement are inadmissible in politics. A belief in universalism need not be accompanied by a desire to erase differences. Indeed, republicans see disagreement as a creative and productive force, highly congenial to and even an indispensable part of the basic republican faith in political dialogue. Discussion and deliberation
The Yale Law Journal
depend for their legitimacy and efficacy on the existence of conflicting views.20 The basic constitutional institutions of checks and balances and federalism should be understood at least partly in this light. Modern republicanism is thus not grounded in a belief in homogeneity on the contrary, heterogeneity is necessary if republican systems are to work. As we shall see, this understanding will call for institutional
It would be extraordinarily foolish to suggest that disparities in perspective and power do not complicate and distort deliberative processes, or to claim that exhortations to citizens and representatives to consult the common good are sufficient to bring about desirable results. And it would be a mistake to suggest that the republican commitments as described here lead directly to a particular social theory or a particular set of institutional arrangements. Large questions-having to do with the appropriate conception of rights, institutions, and groups-remain to be resolved. But the question is one of governing ideals and here liberal republicanism is superior to its competitors.
Republican thought, thus understood, furnishes the basis for approaching a variety of issues in modern public law in somewhat different ways. To be sure, one cannot simply "apply" republican ideas as if they provided self-evident solutions to contemporary legal problems there will be room to contest any particular application. But many contemporary controversies look quite different if viewed through the lens of the republican tradition. Some of these controversies involve public law doctrine in the courts most of them call for initiatives from nonjudicial bodies. For the most part, the discussion of particular areas will be brief and summary, attempting to suggest how republicans would approach a variety of problems rather than to examine those problems in detail.
Campaign Finance Regulation Marketplaces and Freedom of
Expression
Consider, for example, the problems raised by modern campaign finance regulation. Such regulation has often been challenged on the ground that it is inconsistent with the "marketplace of ideas"-indeed, that it effects a kind of First Amendment taking from rich speakers in
[Vol. 97: 1539
Beyond the Revival
order to help poorer ones. It was under this rationale that the Supreme Court invalidated campaign finance regulation in Buckley v. There the Court said that "the concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment."2 The Court did not hold that the effort to promote deliberation among political equals was insufficiently weighty, or inadequately promoted by the legislation at issue the Court held, much more sweepingly, that that effort was illegitimate under the First Amendment. Under a republican approach to the First Amendment, campaign finance regulation would be treated far more hospitably. At least some forms of regulation would be seen as plausible efforts to promote rather than to undermine First Amendment purposes, by counteracting the distortions brought about by expenditures on political campaigns. A deliberative conception of the First Amendment, incorporating a norm of political equality,20 would lead to a quite different analysis from the marketplace model, which has significant pluralist overtones. Above all, the Buckley Court's hostility to redistributive rationales for regulation would dissipate. To be sure, there are large difficulties in designing a system of campaign finance regulation that achieves its intended purposes and that does not serve as an incumbent protection measure. 2"7 But republican understandings would point toward large reforms of the electoral process in an effort to improve political deliberation and to promote political equality and citizenship. For similar reasons, republican ideas offer reasons to reject recent attacks on the fairness doctrine in the broadcast and print media. Such ideas suggest that efforts to promote access to sources of public deliberation should be treated quite hospitably and that the exclusive use of the economic market to regulate such access is undesirable. It is for this reason that on the republican view a principal current threat to a well-functioning system of free expression lies, not in government regulation, but in
The Yale Law Journal
government "inaction" that allows the political process to be excessively influenced by disparities in private wealth and private access. B. Federalism and Intermediate Organizations
A critical feature of the learning of the New Deal period-one with continuing influence on American law-is that the original constitutional structure of dual sovereignty was a large mistake, allied with anachronistic goals of limited government and inconsistent with the need for continuing national intervention into marketplaces.20 But one of the great strengths of the original constitutional system was its simultaneous provision of deliberative representation at the national level and self-determination at the local level, furnishing a sphere for traditional republican goals. A central lesson of the republican revival is the need to provide outlets for self-determination in the public and private spheres. The Tocquevillian understanding of a variety of groups, some in local government, some in purely private organizations, furnishes an alternative understanding, far superior to the New Deal model.
Understandings of this sort lead in a variety of directions. In the area of labor law, collective bargaining appears superior to uniform national standards.2 ' "Reconstitutive law"-reforms that allow state and local flexibility by restructuring markets rather than imposing inflexible national commands-should be viewed hospitably. Proposals to loosen restrictions in federal grant programs are an example. From the republican point of view, efforts to promote workplace democracy also hold out considerable promise."' Interpretations of the establishment clause should recognize the role of religious organizations in the cultivation of republican virtues " approaches to the clause that end up disfavoring religion21 undervalue the role of intermediate organizations in a pluralistic society.
[Vol. 97: 1539

C. Rationality Review Courts review statutes for "rationality" under a variety of constitutional provisions, including the due process, contracts, takings, and equal protection clauses.216 To some, the idea that statues must be "rational" is inconsistent with the nature of the political process, which consists of "deals" among self-interested actors.2 But the requirement of rationality is best understood* as a requirement of deliberation by political officials. The Constitution requires some showing that a burden was imposed, or a benefit denied, for a reason other than the exercise of political power by the advantaged class. In its requirement of an element of deliberation in politics, rationality review recalls republican themes, indeed it is closely associated with Madisonian theories of representation."' Whether or not constitutional courts should enforce the rationality norm more vigorously,2 the norm does have constitutional status, and its continuing existence reveals the tenacity of deliberative conceptions of politics.
D. The Lochner Era
The republican tradition also furnishes a different angle from which to understand the lesson of the Lochner period. In that period, the Supreme Court invalidated a wide range of regulatory measures, frequently by invoking libertarian conceptions of private rights. The Lochner period is frequently understood as a lesson in institutional role, revealing the risks of an aggressive judicial function in overseeing the political process.221 But a different understanding would stress issues of substance as well as of institutional competence.
Such an understanding would emphasize the extent to which the Lochner Court posited the existence of a natural and prepolitical private sphere, one that served as a brake on legislation. The creation of such a sphere, based on a theory of natural rights, coexists uneasily with republican conceptions of politics. Republicans do of course believe in rights, understood as the outcome of a well-functioning deliberative process hence republicans enthusiastically endorse the use of constitutionalism as a check
The Yale Law Journal
on popular majorities. But republicans are skeptical of approaches to politics and constitutionalism that rely on rights that are said to antedate political deliberation. On this view, the problem with the Lochner Court was its reliance on common law and status quo baselines the Court was unable to see the ways in which those baselines were implicated in, indeed a product of law.2 The heirs of Lochner, understood through a republican lens, are not cases like Roe v. Wade, but instead such decisions as Bowers v. Hardwick24 and Washington v. Davis. Both decisions rely on status quo baselines and downplay the role of law in creating existing practice. Thus Hardwick relies on the fact that gays and lesbians have not been permitted to marry, when marriage is in fact a creature of the legal system thus Washington v. Davis disregards the fact that the existing distribution of benefits and burdens between blacks and whites is a function of the legal system, and not exogenous to it. On the republican view, Lochner, Hardwick, and Washington v. Davis share the same defect: they ignore the constitutive functions of law and the ways in which existing practices are dependent on past and present choices of the legal system.
E. Disadvantaged Groups
Republican thought might also provide a basis for understanding that the role of constitutionalism is countering classifications in such areas as race, sex, sexual orientation, and poverty. A central concern here is that

the values supporting such classifications are the product of social power they must therefore be subject to scrutiny and review.22 In this view, judicial decisions that take a skeptical approach to such classifications are consistent with the rejection of the Lochner decision, not with Lochner itself. Republican premises might eventually serve as the foundation of a theory of social subordination to undergird constitutional hostility to discrimination against various social groups. The republican beliefs in political equality and deliberation would function as the defining notions. The argument here would have to be quite elaborate, but some of
There is an irony here. Republican thought has traditionally been allied with exclusionary practices. It is thus odd to invoke republicanism as a basis for rejecting those same practices. But the premises of republican thought furnish an aspiration that turns out to provide the basis for criticism of republican traditions. There is nothing especially unusual in this phenomenon. Frequently cultural commitments are used to revise cultural practices indeed those who attempt to revise existing practice inevitably draw on traditional commitments. The use of republican aspiration to counteract republican practice is simply an illustration of this general proposition.
F. Statutory Construction
In recent years, there has been something of a revival of interest in theories of statutory construction. It should not be controversial to suggest that approaches to construction are informed by theories of the political process. Thus it is suggested that courts should understand statutes as "deals" among self-interested actors and enforce them as such.229 Suggestions of this sort of course are an outgrowth of interest-group pluralism. The idea that the role of the court is solely to implement congressional purposes in the particular case is also congenial to pluralist understandings. On the republican view, by contrast, one of the tasks of statutory construction is to promote actual deliberation in the lawmaking process and to interpret statutes, within the appropriate confines of the judicial role, so as to minimize the pathologies of pluralism.2

The basic defense of canons of statutory construction is that they are literally unavoidable. In hard cases, statutory construction is impossible in the absence of understandings about the background against which Congress legislates. Moreover, it is possible to understand and defend some canons of statutory construction as a straightforward outgrowth of republican conceptions of politics. Many such canons appear alert to possible malfunctions in the legislative process, and attempt to use interpretation to guard against or limit those malfunctions.2 In these canons, or "clear statement" principles, one can find the foundations of a republican approach to statutory construction, an approach that repudiates the idea that the only role of the courts is to ascertain legislative intent in the particular case.
Consider, for example, the idea that appropriations measures should not readily be thought to amend substantive statutes. Such a rule might be defended on the ground that the appropriations process is comparatively likely to be dominated by well-organized private groups, that it lacks visibility, and that the outcomes of that process should be narrowly construed. One might on similar lines defend the notion that federal statutes should not easily be thought to preempt state law. The central ideas here are that from the founding period, the federal system has furnished an opportunity for state and local self-determination, and that the national government should not be taken to have interfered with that goal unless Congress deliberated on the express point. Finally, courts sometimes suggest that statutes will be understood as an integrated whole one part of a statute will not lightly be taken to undermine the general statutory structure. This approach to statutes is controversial to those who believe that statutes tend to be unprincipled trade-offs among private groups. But the idea becomes more understandable if it is understood as an effort to ensure that statutes are not undermined by "deals" that serve as largely invisible qualifications of basic statutory purposes.
These approaches to statutory construction might be defended straight-

forwardly on republican grounds. The narrow construction of appropriations statutes is designed to restrict the effect of measures likely to represent interest-group deals protection of state and local autonomy recalls the republican belief in local self-determination in interpreting statutes as integrated wholes, courts minimize the pathologies of pluralism.
In light of massive changes in the nature of the national government since the founding, however, it would be surprising if existing canons of construction were sufficient. And it is possible to outline a series of canons of construction that are designed to promote republican goals in a different institutional environment. All of these canons, to be noted briefly here, have some basis in current law all of them have been used by courts in the interpretive process. The suggestion here is that they ought to be adopted as self-conscious guides to statutory construction.
1. Proportionality
Some cases suggest a judicial perception that statutes should be construed so that the aggregate social benefits are proportionate to the aggregate social costs.28 This principle, implicit in some of the recent cases,2"" recognizes the risk that well-organized groups might be able to obtain legislation that would likely not be the outcome of a well-functioning Madisonian process. On this view, moreover, regulatory statutes should ordinarily be understood to contain de minimis exceptions. Administrators should generally be authorized to refuse to impose costly regulations for highly speculative or de minimis gains."
The Yale Law Journal
2. Narrow Construction of Procedural Qualifiers An analogous principle, also implicit in the cases, counsels courts narrowly to construe procedural limitations on substantive rights. Many cases involve, for example, the question whether to imply a private right of action to enforce a regulatory statute the appropriate procedures for adjusting or eliminating a substantive benefit, as in a claimed right to a hearing before elimination of welfare benefits and the availability of judicial review to test enforcement or nonenforcement.2 Constitutional questions are of course implicated here. But the constitutional issues are avoided if courts construe procedural qualifications narrowly in the belief that the procedures are less likely to be the product of a deliberative process than the substance, and from fear that procedural qualifications might enable well-organized groups to defeat substantive programs.
3. Consistency and Coordination
Courts have also employed clear statement principles of statutory construction so as to help bring about consistency and coordination in the law.24 Such a role has clear precedent in the context of administrative law. Courts have, for example, aggressively construed statutes of the 1920's and 1930's so as to require old-line agencies to consider environmental concerns.24 The Bob Jones case 2" might best be understood as an effort to ensure that the I.R.S. takes account of the widespread social antagonism toward racial discrimination, as part of the general thrust of "public policy." Some cases limiting agency authority to impose significant costs for speculative benefits can be understood in similar terms. Decisions of this sort might be justified on republican grounds, as part of the integration of statutory systems into a coherent whole that could plausibly be understood as the outcome of deliberative processes. 4. Promoting Accountability Finally, republicans would urge that principles of statutory construction be designed to ensure that decisions are made by those who are politically accountable and highly visible. If the issue is one of allocation of institu-

tional authority, courts should construe statutes in such a way as to promote political accountability. An example is the Supreme Court's decision in Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong,24 in which the Court held-as a matter of due process-that if aliens were to be prevented from serving as federal employees, the decision must be made by Congress or the President rather than by the Civil Service Commission. In other cases the Court, and individual Justices, have suggested that the Constitution requires that certain disabilities may not be visited on certain groups unless an accountable actor has so decided.247 Decisions of this sort might be understood as involving a kind of clear statement principle.
These examples are designed simply to illustrate some of the directions in which statutory construction might move if republican understandings were taken seriously.2 Aspects of republican approaches account for some otherwise surprising practices here, and they might spur further developments as well.
G. Proportional or Group Representation
In recent years, there has been a revival of interest in systems of proportional or group representation. Blacks, women, the handicapped, gays and lesbians, and other disadvantaged groups have often had little success in the ordinary electoral process. In particular, the problem of racial block voting has sometimes made it impossible for blacks to elect anyone in certain election districts.149 This problem-sometimes described as minority vote dilution-produces a system in which blacks and other groups have a much lower percentage of representatives than of the population. ' Be-

cause proportional representation might be justified on pluralist and republican grounds, and because it holds out such substantial promise and risk, it will be useful to discuss the problem in some detail here. There is a solid constitutional pedigree for group representation, notwithstanding the constant and emphatic rejections of constitutionallybased arguments for representation of members of racial minority groups."5' Despite the rigidity of the one person-one vote formula,2 with its majoritarian and individualistic overtones, group representation has always been an important feature of American constitutionalism. At the time of the framing, for example, geography was thought to define distinct communities with distinct interests representation of the states as such seemed only natural. ' It would not be difficult to argue that racial and ethnic groups (among others) are the contemporary analogue to groups that were defined in geographical terms during the founding period. Moreover, the basic constitutional institutions of federalism, bicameralism, and checks and balances share some of the appeal of proportional representation, and owe their origins in part to notions of group representation.2 These institutions proliferate the points of access to government, increasing the ability of diverse groups to influence policy, multiplying perspectives in government, and improving deliberative capacities.2 In this respect, they ensure something in the way of group representation, at least when compared with unitary systems. Of course both the separation of powers and bicameralism grow in part out of efforts to promote representation of diverse groups bicameralism allowed representation of the wealthy and the masses the notion of separation derived from notions of mixed government, which was designed to ensure a measure of representation of groups defined in social and economic terms.
Proportional representation might be designed to ensure representation in the legislature of all those groups that are able to attain more than a minimal share of the vote. Such a system has variants in Germany, Israel, Italy, and many other countries.2 In another form, the system might be designed to ensure that members of disadvantaged groups are given the

power to exert influence on political outcomes.2 Rather than exhorting political participants to seek the common good, advocates of proportional representation claim that the political process should be structured so as to encourage the expression and affirmation of diverse perspectives and interests. There is a large literature on various voting schemes designed to serve the end of proportional representation.2 But whatever the scheme, the simple point is this: If interests are irreducibly opposed, the remedy for political life consists in providing mechanisms for group representation, not in arguing in favor of pursuit of the common good.
Various risks, however, threaten to undermine systems of proportional representation. Proportional representation may marginalize rather than help disadvantaged groups it may also increase the risk of factionalism and political paralysis. The risks of marginalization may be greater in a system in which disadvantaged groups have one representative who speaks for their interests, rather than many representatives who are at least to some degree beholden to them.28 The dangers of factionalism and paralysis threaten to undermine the political process quite generally.2"1 A principal function of proportional representation is to shift the process of coalition building from the electoral process to the representative assembly itself. In so doing, such systems may impair governmental outcomes. This conclusion may follow whether one is looking from the standpoint of politically weak groups or the system as a whole.
From the republican point of view, however, the most significant problems with proportional representation are that it threatens to ratify, perpetuate, and encourage an understanding of the political process as a self-interested struggle among "interests" for scarce social resources, that it may discourage political actors from assuming and understanding the perspectives of others, and that it downplays the deliberative and transformative features of politics. Indeed, in some incarnations, proportional representation tends to accept the basic premises of pluralist politics it simply reallocates the distribution of power that underlies interest-group (even racial) struggle. The reallocation of power is in some settings highly desirable, but the improvement in politics is only partial.

These considerations offer powerful arguments against prominent modern defenses of proportional representation they also offer reasons for skepticism about systems of group representation as a solution to the multiple problems of modern political life. The skepticism is especially appropriate in national institutions, for which Madisonian mechanisms may be better suited. Ironically, however, efforts to ensure proportional representation become much more plausible if they are justified on republican grounds. The basic argument here would be that deliberative processes will be improved, not undermined, if mechanisms are instituted to ensure that multiple groups, particularly the disadvantaged, have access to the process. Group representation, precisely by having this effect, would ensure that diverse views are expressed on an ongoing basis in the representative process, where they might otherwise be excluded. In this respect, group representation would be a kind of second-best solution for the real-world failures of Madisonian deliberation. And the purpose of access is not primarily to allow each group to have its "piece of the action"-though that is not entirely irrelevant-but instead to ensure that processes of deliberation are not distorted by the mistaken appearance of a common set of interests on the part of all concerned. In this incarnation, proportional representation is designed to increase the likelihood that political outcomes will incorporate some understanding of the perspective of all those affected. For this reason proportional representation may be the functional analogue to the institutions of checks and balances and federalism, recognizing the creative functions of disagreement and multiple per-

spectives for the governmental process. In this sense there is continuity between recent proposals for proportional representation and the republican elements of the original constitutional regime. The formal or functional exclusion of important categories of the citizenry has often been an ingredient in republican systems contemporary politics furnishes several illustrations. For this reason, proportional or group representation may, in some contexts, be a highly desirable reform. Perhaps surprisingly, it is desirable above all from the standpoint of republican premises that its supporters are often at such pains to deny. Distinctly non-Madisonian institutions may be necessary to achieve the Madisonian goal of deliberative democracy.
Republican conceptions of politics have taken many forms only some of them are attractive. I have suggested that the most powerful versions of republicanism are not antiliberal at all. Instead they borrow from a significant strand of the liberal tradition, emphasizing political equality, the need to provide outlets for self-determination by the citizenry, the impossibility of maintaining democracy without a degree of citizen mobilization, the value of institutional and rights-based constraints on factionalism and self-interested representation, and the deliberative functions of politics. Above all, republican theories stress the importance of dialogue and disagreement in the governmental process they are designed to ensure, not that political actors are disembodied, but that to the extent possible they look through the eyes of all those affected." 6'
It would be a mistake to suggest that by itself, an approach of this sort could lead to a particular set of institutional arrangements or a particular specification of public and private rights. But if understood in this fashion, republican theories have played a central role in American public law. The task for modern republicanism is not, however, one of excavation. Contemporary republicanism is more to be made than found, even if historical commitments can illuminate, in somewhat surprising ways, the nature of American constitutionalism at its inception.
One of the principal tasks for modern constitutional theory is to move beyond the republican revival by integrating aspects of traditional republican thought with the rise of the modern regulatory state, emerging theories of social subordination of various groups, and the need for intermediate organizations, public and private, to satisfy republican goals. I have suggested that many areas of modern legal controversy are illuminated by republican understandings, and that some such areas would be pushed in
