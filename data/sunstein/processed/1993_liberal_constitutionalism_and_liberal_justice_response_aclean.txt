 Cass R. Sunstein* Liberal Constitutionalism and Liberal Justice The Framers of the American Constitution hoped to create a deliberative democracy. They also believed in a modest role for the judiciary. Both the hope and the belief were deepened during the Civil War and New If modem constitutional interpreters were guided by the Deal periods. same basic idea of deliberative democracy-with its apparently limited role for the judiciary-what would happen to our constitutional rights as we now know them? It seems clear that a well-functioning deliberative democracy would include a large set of rights, including, above all, rights of political participation and political (not economic) equality.' Nonetheless, a system of deliberative democracy might well fall short of what would be required in a fully just society. Broad rights of privacy would not necessarily flourish in such a system. So, too, a system of deliberative democracy might slight at least some rights of conscience, including the right to speak freely when politics is not involved. It therefore seems reasonable to ask whether we might not be quite wrong to root our theory of constitutionalism or constitutional interpretation in a theory of democracy, whether deliberative or otherwise. Would not such an effort provide an unnecessarily truncated system of rights? Many of the great liberals, including Mill and Rawls, offer considerable support for deliberative democracy.2 But most of the * Karl N.

Texas Law Review great liberals, emphatically including Mill and Rawls, point to a far broader set of rights than those that follow from democracy alone.3 Invoking ideas of this sort, Professor Fleming's illuminating paper argues that deliberative democracy is too partial and thin a source of constitutional safeguards.4 This guiding ideal fails to furnish the full set of guarantees that emerge from a proper exercise in constitutional constructivism.5 In his view, the ideal stresses republican rights6 without sufficiently respecting liberal protections against government intrusions into what is properly taken as the private sphere.7 Thus Professor Fleming argues for constitutional protection of liberty of conscience, autonomy, and freedom of association, even if these rights cannot be associated with democracy itself.8 More particularly, Professor Fleming argues that the rights to choose abortion and to engage in consensual sexual activity find a secure home in autonomy principles even if democratic equality is not at stake. 9 There is an obvious affinity between Rawlsian principles and those that emerge from deliberative democracy.1" But Professor Fleming argues for what he considers to be a more thoroughly Rawlsian approach to constitutional interpretation," an approach that would stress the interest in RAWLS, A, THEORY OF JUSTICE 356-62 (1971) (contrasting deliberative democracy with market conceptions of democracy). 6. These rights are emphatically liberal too; they are crucial liberties of the moderns. See SAMUEL H. BEER, To MAKE A NATION: THE REDISCOVERY OF AMERICAN FEDERALISM 264-75 (1993) (describing a liberal commitment to governmentby discussion); MILL, ON LIBERTY, supra note 2, at 15 (noting that the rights and interests of every person are secure from being disregarded only where every person is able to assert them); RAWLS, POLITICAL LIBERALISM, supra note 2, at 5-6 (stating that political rights are essential to political liberty). Liberal Constitutionalism and Liberal Justice autonomy even if that interest is not clearly connected with democratic considerations. pretation, as Professor Fleming is of course aware, and so I am not sure whether a Rawlsian form of constitutional constructivism would diverge from one based on deliberative democracy. background for the discussion of the key issue of judicial interpretation of the Constitution. omit certain rights that a just society ultimately would furnish.1" The distinction might be justified on various grounds, including the difficulty of obtaining agreement on the relevant rights at the constitutional stage17 and the likelihood that those rights will be adequately guaranteed through ordinary political processes. In the United States, for example, it is reasonable to think that freedom of contract or environmental protection are important goods that should not be recognized in the Constitution. 8 In Eastern Europe, we might believe that there is no special reason to constitutionalize the welfare state, even if its guarantees are properly part of a decent society; perhaps there is no risk that the welfare state will be jeopardized by the new regimes. One of a constitution's distinctive rolesespecially in the realm of rights-is to counteract predictable problems in the ordinary politics of particular nations. For this reason a constitution might not guarantee rights that, while a part of a good society, are not at particular risk in the politics of the country for which the constitution is designed. More generally, a constitution might be thought to be a mechanism for carrying out certain practical tasks, and if we focus on those practical goals, we might end up with a document that does not by any means track the best theory of justice. 16. I am putting to one side here the complex relations among justice, rights, and the quality of life furnished in a good society. by positing rights to collective goods. be necessary to stress that judges are often unable to bring about significant social reform on their own.' Because of the need for a high level of judicial modesty, we might not be surprised to find significant traces of the seemingly narrow political question doctrine throughout constitutional law in general-as constitutional rights are judicially "underenforced," and properly so, because of the courts' distinctive limitations.21 These points will lead to sharp differences between judicially enforceable rights on the one hand and, on the other, rights that are a part of a just society or that belong in a good constitution. Even if, for example, rights to subsistence and health care qualify as rights that a good society would recognize, they might well be deemed absent from our Constitution if judges use the ordinary sources of interpretation. And even if such rights can be found through those sources-even if text, structure, and history leave room to maneuver-judges might believe that these rights are not properly subject to judicial enforcement. The courts may lack the tools that are required for successful implementation; their efforts may be futile or counterproductive. In any case, reasonable people might think that judges should be especially cautious in these (and many other') areas. It seems, then, that the category of judicially enforceable rights is a subset of the category of genuine constitutional rights, and that the category of genuine constitutional rights is in turn a subset of the category of rights recognized in a just society. Texas Law Review Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. There is thus real room for judicial protection of autonomy rights of this kind, even if those rights In these have little or nothing to do with democracy or deliberation. circumstances it seems best to say that deliberative democracy is an important source of both constitutional rights and interpretive principles, but far from exhaustive; the two words capture only a part of the picture.' On this score I agree with Professor Fleming. Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment, 101 YALE L.J 1193, 1220, 1264 (1992) (proposing a refined model of incorporation of substantive guarantees into the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause). Part of the controversy stems also from nontextual concerns about judicial definition of fundamental rights, concerns that seem to me legitimate for reasons suggested below. elsewhere).' If courts do not protect the preconditions for democratic government, the risks to liberty may be very grave. The predicate for judicial caution evaporates when, for example, a group has been disenfranchised or when the right of political protest has been violated. It follows that vigorous judicial protection of political speech is fully justified, indeed more fully justified than judicial protection of many other rights. This judgment cannot be defended by an algorithm, but I think that it is an important lesson of our history, as well as of an inquiry into the institutional characteristics of judges and legislatures. Some platitudes are worth repeating: So long as democratic goals" are met, judges should allow majorities to make (what judges consider to be) some mistakes, even if those mistakes involve (what judges consider to be) injustice. The realm of what is judicially enforced as unconstitutional is not coextensive with the realm of the unjust as judicially conceived, even though some judges may be able to offer especially persuasive accounts. 31. Of course these are contested too. I am arguing that it is appropriate for courts to take the Constitution as sharply delimiting the ingredients of democratic deliberation, while also allowing the political process a measure of discretion in defining fundamental interests. Liberal Constitutionalism and Liberal Justice Democracy is itself a requirement of justice, and in any case there are large difficulties in adapting any theory of justice for use in constitutional interpretation, where we are dealing with at best a second-best world, one that requires constraints on judicial discretion. The appropriate theory of justice, adapted for such a world, may well call for a theory of constitutional interpretation based principally-if not exclusively-on deliberative democracy,37 because that theory allows the requisite space for democratic rule, that is, the space implied by the appropriate theory of justice.
