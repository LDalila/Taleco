Sexual  Orientation  and the  Constitution: A
Note  on  the  Relationship  Between  Due
Process  and Equal  Protection

Cass R.  Sunsteint

In  Bowers v  Hardwick,1  the  Supreme  Court held  that the  due
process  clause  does  not  protect  the  right to  engage  in  homosexual
sodomy. The  Court  said  that  heightened  judicial  protection  under
that  clause  was  reserved  to  rights  "implicit  in  the  concept  of  or-
dered  liberty"  or  "deeply  rooted  in this Nation's  history and  tradi-
tion."' 2 According to the Court, homosexual  sodomy could  not qual-
ify  for  special  protection  under  either  test.3

In  some  circles,  Hardwick was  thought  to  spell  the  end,  at
least for  the  immediate  future,  to  efforts  to  use  constitutional  liti-
gation to  prevent government  from imposing sanctions  on the basis
of  sexual  orientation.  In  Padula v  Webster,4  for  example,  the
United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  District of  Columbia  Cir-
cuit  upheld  the  FBI's  policy  of  considering  homosexual  conduct  a
"significant"  and  often  dispositive  factor  in  employment  decisions.
The  court  said  that  the  issue  was  controlled  by Hardwick:

It would  be quite anomolous  [sic],  on  its face, to  declare  status
defined  by  conduct  that  states  may  constitutionally  criminal-
ize  as  deserving  of  strict  scrutiny  under  the  equal  protection

clause....  If the  Court was  unwilling  to  object to  state  laws
that  criminalize  the  behavior  that  defines  the  class,  it  is
hardly  open  to a  lower  court to  conclude  that  state  sponsored
discrimination  against  the  class  is  invidious.'

What  the  Padula court  described  as  an  anomaly  became  the
holding  of United  States  Court of Appeals  for  the  Ninth Circuit in
Watkins  v  U.S. Army.6  There  the  court  concluded  that  the  equal
protection  component  of the  Due Process  Clause  forbids  the  Army
from  discriminating  on  the  basis  of  sexual  orientation.7  The  court
so  held  in spite  of Hardwick and Padula, and in the face  of  a vig-
orous  dissent  from  Judge  Reinhardt.  Judge  Reinhardt  predicted
that  "a  wiser  and  more  enlightened  Court"  would  overrule  Hard-
wick  and,  indeed,  described  that  decision  in  exceedingly  harsh
terms:  "I  believe  that  the  Supreme  Court  egregiously  misinter-
preted the  Constitution  in Hardwick....  I believe  that history will
view  Hardwick much as  it views  Plessy v Ferguson .... 8 In Judge
Reinhardt's  view,  however,  the  Hardwick decision  compelled  the
conclusion  that the  Army's  policy  did  not  offend  the  Constitution.
In  this  essay,  I  make  two  claims.  The  first is  quite  narrow.  In
spite  of  appearances,  Hardwick-strictly as  a  matter  of  doc-
trine-was  interpreted  correctly  in  the  majority  opinion  in  Wat-
kins,9  and  misread  in  Padula and  Judge  Reinhardt's  dissenting

7  Since  Watkins  involved  a  federal  measure,  no  question  was  raised  under  the  Equal
Protection  Clause  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  The  court  relied  instead  on  the  equal
protection  component  of the Fifth  Amendment's  Due Process  Clause,  initially recognized  in
Bolling v  Sharpe, 347  US  497,  499  (1954).  See  847  F2d  at  1335  n  9.  For  purposes  of the
present  discussion,  the  phrases  "equal  protection  component  of the  Due  Process  Clause"
and  "Equal  Protection  Clause"  will  be  used  interchangeably.  Again  for  present  purposes,  it
may be  assumed  that the basic  antidiscrimination  principles  applicable  to the  states are  also
applicable  to the  federal  government.  In some  contexts,  however,  that assumption  is  highly
questionable.  See,  for example,  Mathews v  Diaz, 426  US  67  (1976)  (Medicare eligibility  stat-
ute  distinguishing  among  aliens does  not  violate  Due Process  Clause  of Fifth  Amendment).

8 847  F2d at  1358.
'  Much  of the  Watkins opinion  emphasizes  that the  relevant Army regulation  discrimi-
nates  on the  basis of homosexual  status  rather  than homosexual  acts.  See  847  F2d  at 1338,
1343.  This  feature  of the opinion  serves  to distinguish Hardwick in  a persuasive  way:  if the
relevant  acts  are  not  at issue  in  Watkins, Hardwick does  not control.

It  would,  however,  be  a  mistake  to  conclude  that  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  freely
permits  discrimination  against  a  class of gays  and  lesbians,  even  if  some,  many,  or even  all
of them  engage  in  activity  that may  be regulated  consistently  with the  Due Process  Clause.
The  principal  thrust  of the  Watkins  decision-emphasizing  unjustified  hostility,  past  and
present,  against  gay  men-supports  that  conclusion.  See  847  F2d at  1345-49.  Watkins  can
be  distinguished  from  Hardwick even  if the  former  decision  were to be  applied  to a  class of
people  including  some,  many,  or  all  who  engage  in  the  conduct  at issue  in  Hardwick.

opinion  in  Watkins. Properly  understood,  the  Hardwick  decision
does  not resolve  the  issue  in  Watkins  and Padula.

My  second,  somewhat  broader  claim  is  that  the  disagreement
over  the meaning  of Hardwick contains  a larger  lesson for  the rela-
tionship  between  the  Due  Process  and  Equal  Protection  Clauses.
That lesson  is structural,  and  operates  even  in the face  of different
views  about  how  hard  cases  should  be  resolved  under  the  two
clauses. From its  inception,  the  Due Process  Clause  has  been  inter-
preted  largely  (though not  exclusively)  to  protect  traditional  prac-
tices  against  short-run  departures.  The  clause  has  therefore  been
associated  with  a particular  conception  of judicial  review,  one  that
sees  the  courts  as  safeguards  against  novel  developments  brought
about  by  temporary  majorities  who  are  insufficiently  sensitive  to
the  claims  of  history. 10

The  Equal  Protection  Clause,  by  contrast,  has  been  under-
stood  as an  attempt to  protect  disadvantaged  groups from  discrim-
inatory practices,  however  deeply  engrained  and  longstanding.  The
Due  Process  Clause  often  looks  backward;  it  is  highly  relevant  to
the  Due Process  issue whether  an existing  or time-honored  conven-
tion,  described  at the  appropriate  level of  generality, is  violated  by
the  practice  under  attack.  By  contrast,  the  Equal  Protection
Clause  looks  forward,  serving  to  invalidate  practices  that  were
widespread  at the  time  of its ratification  and  that were expected  to
endure.  The  two  clauses  therefore  operate  along  different  tracks.

Because  of the  independence  of the  lines  of analysis  under the
two  clauses,  the  conclusion  in  Hardwick does  not  dispose  of  the
issue  in  Watkins.  This  claim  suggests  that  the  Equal  Protection
Clause  is  a natural  route  for  constitutional  protection  against  dis-
crimination  on  the  basis  of  sexual  orientation;"  and  that,  more

(Holmes dissenting).  For a  recent example,  see James  M. Buchanan,  Contractarian Political
Economy  and Constitutional Interpretation, 78  Am  Econ  Rev  135,  139  (May  1988)  ("The
function  of the judiciary  is  protection  of  that which  is  ....  The  judicial  branch  properly
serves  a stabilizing rather  than a reformist...  role. The  courts should  protect what is rather
than  try  to  promote  what  might  be  . .

"  I  do not  discuss  in this  essay the  complex issues raised  by the  claim  that discrimina-
tion on  the basis  of sexual  orientation  is a  form  of discrimination  on  the basis  of sex. Advo-
cates  of that  position  argue  that discrimination  on  the  basis  of sexual  orientation  is  (a)  at
least on  its face,  a  form of sex  discrimination;  (b)  part  of a  system  of sex  role  stereotyping;
and  (c)  even  if in not  readily apparent  ways,  a  method  of disadvantaging  women.  See  Sylvia

generally,  statutes  that  are  unaffected  by  the  Due  Process  Clause
may be  drawn  into  severe  doubt  by principles  of  equal  protection.

I.  THE  REACH  OF  BOWERS  V  HARDWICK

A

Perry  Watkins  enlisted  in  the  Army  in  1967,  at the  age  of  19.
The  pre-induction  medical  form  asked  whether  Watkins  had  ho-
mosexual  tendencies;  he  answered  "yes."' 2  The  Army  found  Wat-
kins  qualified  for  admission  and  inducted  him.  In  1975,  the  Army
convened  a board  of  officers  to  decide  whether  Watkins  should  be
terminated  because  of his  homosexual  tendencies.  Watkins's  com-
manding  officer  testified  that  he  was  "the  best  clerk  I  have  ever
known,"  that he  did  "a  fantastic  job  -
excellent,"  and  that  Wat-
kins's open  homosexuality did  not affect the  company.1 3  A  sergeant
stated  that  Watkins's  sexual  orientation  was  widely  known  but
that it  caused  no problems  among  other soldiers.  The  board unani-
mously  recommended  that  Watkins  be  retained  "because  there  is
no  evidence  suggesting  that  his  behavior  has  had  either  a degrad-
ing  effect upon  unit performance,  morale  or  discipline,  or  upon his
own  job  performance."''

In 1977,  Watkins  was  initially denied a position in the  Nuclear
Surety  Personnel  Reliability  Program;  the  ground  for  denial  was
Watkins's  statements  about  his sexual  orientation.  Watkins's  com-
manding  officer  requested  that  he  be  requalified  for  the  position,
stating  that  Watkins  was  "one  of  our  most  respected  and  trusted
soldiers,  both  by  his  superiors  and  his  subordinates"  and  that
"[f]rom  daily  personal  contacts  I can  attest to the outstanding pro-
fessional  attitude,  integrity,  and  suitability  ...  of  ... Watkins." 5
The  decision  to  deny  Watkins  a  position  in  the  nuclear  program
was  reversed.

In  1980,  Watkins's  security  clearance  was  revoked  because  of
his  sexual  orientation. In  1981,  the  Army issued  a regulation  man-
dating  the  discharge  of  all  homosexuals.1 6  In  the  same  year,  an
army board  voted to  discharge  Watkins because  of his  revelation  of
his  sexual  orientation.  Watkins  brought  suit  in  federal  district

court. 17  While  the  action  was  pending,  the  Army  rated  Watkins's
performance  and professionalism,  giving him a score  of 85 out of 85
possible  points.  The  Army's  written  statement  said  that  "Watkins
is without  exception,  one of the  finest Personnel  Action  Center  Su-
pervisors  I  have encountered....  He  requires  no  supervision  ....
Watkins'  potential  is  unlimited.'" s

The  district  court  held  that  Watkins's  discharge  violated
neither  the Constitution  nor any relevant  statute."" A divided  court
of appeals  reversed,  holding  that  the  discharge  violated  the  Equal
Protection  Clause.  The  court  concluded  that  Bowers  v  Hardwick
did  not  resolve  the  equal  protection  issue,  that  discrimination  on
the basis  of sexual  orientation  should  be  subject  to  heightened  ju-
dicial  scrutiny,  and  that  the  Army  could  not  meet  its  burden  of
justification. 0

B

If Hardwick is  examined  in  simple  lawyerly  terms,  the  major-
ity  in  Watkins  appears  to  have  understood  the  reach  of  the  deci-
sion  correctly.  There  was  no  equal  protection  issue  before  the  Su-
preme  Court  in Hardwick. The  plaintiffs  invoked  the  Due Process
Clause,  complaining  that  the  Georgia  prohibition  on  consensual
sodomy  was  an  impermissible  invasion  of  constitutional  privacy.
The  Georgia  statute  did  not classify  on the  basis  of sexual  orienta-
tion.2 '  Indeed,  the  Supreme  Court  said,  in  explicit  terms,  that  its
conclusion  did  not  deal  with  principles  of  equal  protection.22  At
first  glance,  then,  the  result  in  Hardwick does  not  bear  on  chal-
lenges,  brought  on  equal  protection  grounds,  to  discrimination  on
the  basis  of  sexual  orientation.

It is  hardly  unusual,  however,  for  a  decision  not  directly  deal-
ing  with an  unanswered  question  to have  powerful  implications  for
that  question,  or  implicitly  to  resolve  it. This  view  underlies  both
the  Padula decision  and  Judge  Reinhardt's  dissenting  opinion  in
Watkins.  In  Padula, the  court  of  appeals  suggested  that  it  would

be  quite  strange  to  hold  that  the  Constitution  allows  the  state  to
criminalize  certain  conduct,  but  at  the  same  time  that  it  forbids
the  state  to  discriminate  against  those  who  engage  in  that  very
conduct.2 3  In  the  same  vein,  Judge  Reinhardt  argued  that  "when
conduct  that  plays  a  central  role  in  defining  a group  may  be  pro-
hibited  by the  state, it  cannot  be asserted  with  any legitimacy  that
the  group  is  specially  protected  by the  Constitution. '24

At  first  glance,  there  is  a  powerful  logic  to  this  view.  After
Bowers v  Hardwick, the  Constitution  does  not  protect  homosexual
acts from  criminalization.  Since  it  does  not, it  may  appear  peculiar
to  suggest  that  participation  in  conduct  that  may  constitutionally
be  criminalized  can help  to entitle  a group  to special  constitutional
protection.

25

Despite  appearances,  there  is no  peculiarity  in this  suggestion.
In  Hardwick, the  Court  did  not  answer  the  question  whether  a
state  may  constitutionally  criminalize  heterosexual 
sodomy.
Whether  the  Court  had  answered  that  question  in  the  affirmative
or  in the  negative,  its  answer  would not  have  prevented  a  plaintiff
from  resorting  to  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  to challenge  a  stat-
ute  discriminating  on  the  basis  of  sexual  orientation  or,  indeed,
criminalizing  homosexual  but not heterosexual  sodomy.26 It  should
make  no difference  if the  question of heterosexual  sodomy  remains
undecided.

More  generally,  the Equal Protection  Clause  is  aimed at classi-
fications.  The  question  in  Padula and  Watkins  was  whether  dis-
crimination  against  a  subgroup  of  people,  some  or  many  of  whom
engage  in  conduct  that  can  constitutionally  be  criminalized,  is  a

23 822 F2d  at  103.  It  should be  unnecessary  to point out,  however,  that not all  gays  and

lesbians  engage  in  the  conduct  at issue  in  Hardwick.

24  847  F2d  at  1357.
25  As  we  will  see,  this  way  of  phrasing  the  issue  in  Watkins  is  misleading,  not  least
because  many members  of the  class  penalized  by the  Army regulation  did not  engage  in  the
conduct  at  issue  in Hardwick.

26  See  note  84  and  accompanying  text. As  elaborated  below,  the Hardwick case has  no
relevance to  a statute  challenged  on  the ground  that it  discriminates  on  the basis  of sexual
orientation;  such  a statute  would  have  no necessary  connection  with  homosexual  acts. More-
over,  it  is  important  to  understand  that a  statute  that discriminates  between  people  who
have  engaged  in  homosexual  acts, and  people  who  have  not, does not  in fact discriminate  on
the  basis  of sexual  orientation.  Some  people  of heterosexual  orientation  have  engaged  in
homosexual  acts;  some  people  of homosexual  orientation  have  not  engaged  in  homosexual
acts.  For reasons  suggested below,  a statute  discriminating  on  the basis of sexual  orientation
should  be  subject  to  special  scrutiny  under  the Equal Protection  Clause; the same  consider-
ations  also support the view that  statutes should  be  subject to such  scrutiny  if they  discrimi-
nate  on the  basis  of participation  in  homosexual  acts,  though I  do  not  argue  that point  in
detail  here.

violation  of  the  Equal  Protection  Clause.  Nothing  in  Bowers  v
Hardwick purports  to  answer  that question.  The  fact  that the  un-
derlying  conduct  can  be  criminalized  is  irrelevant  to  the  problem;
it  is  always  immaterial  to  an  equal  protection  challenge  that mem-
bers  of the  victimized  group  are  engaging  in conduct  that  could  be
prohibited  on  a  general  basis."

The principal  flaw  in both  Padula and  Judge  Reinhardt's  dis-
senting  opinion  in  Watkins  is  that  they  read  the  Constitution  as
an  undifferentiated  unit, rather  than  as  a  set  of  entitlements  and
prohibitions  that  are  targeted  at  quite  discrete  problems.  Each
constitutional  provision  must be  taken on  its  own.  It  would  hardly
be  odd  to  find  that  one  constitutional  provision  invalidates  prac-
tices  about  which  another  provision  has  nothing  to  say.  The
Fourth  Amendment,  for  example,  does  not  disable  the  state  from
regulating  activities  that  the  First  Amendment  protects,  and  vice
versa.  The  fact  that the  Fourth  Amendment  does  not prevent  the
state  from  regulating  all  speech-related  activities  could  not plausi-
bly be  a reason  to immunize  speech  from special  First Amendment
scrutiny.28  Such  phenomena  can  be  found  throughout  constitu-
tional  law.  As we  shall  see,  results  of this  sort should  be  especially
unsurprising  for  the  Due  Process  and  Equal  Protection  Clauses.

To  clarify  the  point  in  the  context  of  Watkins, it  is  useful to
imagine  that  there  is  no  privacy  principle  in  the  Constitution,  or
that the  Due  Process  Clause  is  purely  procedural. 9  Suppose  that
in  such  circumstances  a  plaintiff  brings  a  suit  challenging,  under
the  Due  Process  Clause,  a  statute  criminalizing  consensual  homo-
sexual  sodomy.  The  constitutional  challenge  would  of  course  fail,
for the  Due Process  Clause-containing  no  privacy  principle  or be-
ing  limited  to  procedure-does  not  bar  the  law  in  question.  The
fact that a purely procedural  Due  Process  Clause,  or a Clause  with-

27 To  this extent,  the  Watkins court is persuasive  in  suggesting an  analogy  to discrimi-

nation  against (for  example)  blacks  who  engage  in  acts  that may  constitutionally  be  prohib-
ited.  847  F2d  at 1340.  The  fact that the underlying  conduct  may  be  banned  does  not  mean
that  a  classification  against  some  people  who  engage  in  that  conduct  is  permissible.  The
analogy  is imperfect, however,  because  it has  already  been  decided  that blacks  are  entitled
to  special  judicial  protection;  the  question  in  Watkins  was  whether  gays  and  lesbians  are
entitled  to  such  protection  in  the  face  of Hardwick.
28  See  Stanley  v  Georgia, 394  US  557  (1969).
29  Positions  of this sort are  defended  in,  for  example,  David  P. Currie,  The  Constitu-
tion in the Supreme Court ch  11  at 363-82  (Chicago, 1985);  Robert H. Bork, Neutral Princi-
ples and Some  First Amendment  Problems, 47  Ind  L  J  1, 8-11  (1971).  The  view  that  the
Due Process  Clause is without substantive  content has  of course been repeatedly  rejected  by
the  Court.  See  for  example  Roe  v  Wade,  410  US  113  (1973);  Moore  v  East Cleveland, 431
US  494  (1977).

out  a  privacy  principle,  does  not  protect  homosexual  conduct
would  have  no  bearing  on  the  question  whether  some  other  clause
forbids  the  state  from  singling  out  gays  and  lesbians  for  special
disability.  The  two  questions  are  entirely  unrelated.  Or  suppose
that  a  ban  on  consensual  homosexual  activity  were  challenged  as
violative  of  the  First  Amendment  or  the  Takings  Clause.  Such  a
challenge  would  in  all  likelihood 0  fail;  but the  failure  would  have
no  consequences  for  an attack  brought  under the  Equal Protection
Clause.

The  situation  in  Watkins  was  quite  similar.  The  Supreme
Court  based  its  decision  in  Bowers  v  Hardwick on  the  view  that
the  scope  of  substantive  due  process  should  be  defined  largely  by
reference  to  tradition. Thus the  Court looked  to  whether  homosex-
ual  sodomy  was  "implicit  in  the  concept  of  ordered  liberty"  or
"deeply  rooted  in  this  Nation's  history  and  tradition."3 1  But  a
holding  that the  Due  Process  Clause  extends  thus  far  and  no  far-
ther  does  not  affect  the  equal  protection  claim,  which  is  founded
on  a  different  set  of  values.  As  we  will  see,  the  Equal  Protection
Clause  is  a  self-conscious  repudiation  of  history  and  tradition  as
defining  constitutional  principles.  Analysis  of  an  equal  protection
claim  therefore  proceeds  along  an  entirely  distinct  track.  To  say
this  is  not to  provide  the  affirmative  argument  for  the  outcome  in
Watkins. It  is, however, to  suggest that the Hardwick decision  sim-
ply  does  not  bear  on  the  problem  in  that  case,  and  that  in  this
respect  the  Watkins  majority  was  correct.

In short, the  question  after Hardwick is not whether it  is  illog-
ical to  hold that those  who  engage  in  acts  that  can  be  criminalized
might by  virtue of that fact qualify  as a suspect  class.  The  question
is  instead  whether  it  is  anomalous  to  conclude  that  a  class  that
includes  people  who  engage  in  acts  substantively  unprotected  by
the  Due  Process  Clause  can  be  entitled  to  judicial  protection
against official  discrimination.  In view  of  the  different  functions  of
the  Due  Process  and  Equal  Protection  Clauses,  an  affirmative  an-
swer  to  that  question  would  produce  no  anomaly.

Indeed,  close  parallels  to  this sort  of reasoning  can  be found  in
a  long  line  of  cases  in  existing  law.  The  "fundamental  rights"
branch  of  equal  protection  doctrine  is  self-consciously  designed  to
prohibit  states  from  drawing  impermissible  lines  with  respect  to
rights that  the  Due  Process  Clause  does  not  substantively  protect.
For  example,  discrimination  with  respect  to  the  right to  vote  and

the right to  appeal  is  prohibited  even  though  the  states  may elimi-
nate  both  rights.2  Similarly,  the  Court  has  barred  distinctions  af-
fecting  the  right  to  marry"3  and  the  right  to  procreate3 4  while  as-
suming  that those  rights  are  substantively  unprotected  by  the  Due
Process  Clause.  The  Court's  decision  in  Eisenstadt v  Baird 5  was
also  in  this tradition,  invalidating  a  distinction  between  the  rights
of the married  and  the unmarried  to  obtain  contraceptives  without
holding  that  there  was  a  substantive  right  of  access  to  contracep-
tion.  In  this  sense,  there  is  nothing  at  all  unusual  in  the  Watkins
court's  conclusion that the Equal  Protection Clause  forbids classifi-
cations  with respect  to practices  that the  Due  Process  Clause  does
not  independently  protect  from  state  control.3 6

The  principal  objection  to  this  line  of  argument  stems  from
the way  the  Court  constructed  its  opinion  in Hardwick. In  the  Su-
preme  Court,  the plaintiffs  challenged  the regulation  of  consensual
sodomy on  due process grounds.3 7  The  plaintiffs  did not speak  only
in  terms  of  sexual  orientation.  It  was  the  Court  that  understood
the  case  as  presenting  an  issue  of  regulation  of  homosexual  con-
duct  rather  than  of  sodomy  in  general.3 8  The  Court  upheld  the
statute  only  insofar  as  it  applied  to  consensual  homosexual  sod-
omy.  The  Court  reserved  the  question  whether  the  statute  would
be  valid if applied  to heterosexual  sodomy.3 9 In this way,  the  Court
itself  drew  a  line  between  homosexual  and  heterosexual  conduct,
upholding  regulation  of  the  first  but  not  necessarily  the  second.
The  problem,  in  short, is  this:  if Watkins is  correct,  the  very  line
drawn  by the  Supreme  Court  in Hardwick violates  the  Equal  Pro-
tection  Clause.  On  this  view,  it  is  quite  odd  to  suggest  that Hard-
wick  did  not  at  least  implicitly  resolve  the  equal  protection
problem.

The  first  difficulty  with  this  line  of  argument  is  that  it  disre-
gards  the  fact  that Hardwick was  self-consciously  styled  as  an  in-
terpretation  of the  Due  Process  Clause.  The  Court  itself  said  that
respondent  did  not  defend  the judgment  below  on  the  basis  of  the

'"  The  difference  lies  in  the  fact  that  Watkins  relies  on  the  "suspect  class"  branch  of
equal  protection,  whereas  Eisenstadt and  related  cases  are  rooted  in  the  "fundamental
rights"  branch.  That  difference,  however,  seems  immaterial  for  present  purposes.

Equal Protection  Clause,  and  that disclaimer  would be  puzzling  in-
deed  if the  Court's  interpretation  of  the Due  Process  Clause  were
understood  to  resolve  the  equal  protection  issue.

The  larger  point  is  that  it  may  be  plausible  to  interpret  the
Due  Process  Clause  to  permit  the  regulation  of  homosexual  sod-
omy but to proscribe  the regulation  of heterosexual sodomy. 40  Such
an  interpretation  would  not,  however,  immunize  from  attack  on
equal protection  grounds  a law that drew  a line  between  heterosex-
uals  on  the  one  hand  and  gays  and  lesbians  on  the  other.  In  its
substantive  dimension,  the  Due  Process  Clause  protects  a range  of
basic rights;  it  does  not  speak to  the  constitutionality  of  classifica-
tions.  It  is  in  this  respect  that  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  oper-
ates  as  a  functional  complement  to  the  Due  Process  Clause,  ad-
dressing  a  different  set  of  questions.  For  this reason,  it  would  not
be  anomalous  for  the Equal Protection  Clause  to  prohibit the state
from  drawing lines  that a tradition-based  Due Process  Clause  itself
incorporates.  In order to  support that view,  however,  it  will be nec-
essary  to  talk  more  generally  about  the  relationship  between  the
Due  Process  and  Equal  Protection  Clauses.

II.  DuE  PROCESS  AND  EQUAL  PROTECTION

The  discussion  thus far  has  suggested  that  purely  as  a  doctri-
nal  matter, the  court of  appeals  was  correct  in  concluding that  the
due  process  ruling  in Hardwick had  no  bearing  on  the  equal  pro-
tection  issue  in  Watkins. That  claim  reveals  a  more  fundamental
point.  From  its  origin,  the  Due  Process  Clause  has  often  been  in-
terpreted  so as  to protect traditionally  recognized  rights  from state
and federal power. 41 Nothing in the text of the  clause  compels  such
a conclusion,  and  on this  point as  on  others  the  history is  ambigu-

40  That  question  is  beyond  the scope  of the present  discussion.  It is  notable, moreover,
that at the  very  most, the  Hardwick Court  distinguished  between  homosexual  and  hetero-
sexual  acts;  it  did  not  draw  any  line  between  homosexual  and  heterosexual  people,  as  did
the  Army  regulation  at  issue  in  Watkins.  847  F2d  at  1336-37  n  11.  For  reasons  already
discussed,  that line  raises  distinctive  considerations  under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause.

11 At  its  inception,  however,  the  Due  Process  Clause  had  a  kind  of  equal  protection
dimension  as  well.  The  clause  grew  out  of  requirements  in  English  law  that  the  executive
must  comply with "the  law  of the land."  See  C.H.  McIlwain, Due Process of Law in Magna
Carta, 14  Colum  L Rev  27,  44-49  (1914);  Edward  S. Corwin,  The Doctrine of Due Process of
Law Before  the Civil War, 24  Harv  L Rev  366,  368-70  (1911).  Such requirements  imposed a
principle of generality  and  equal treatment.  The Executive  was  thereby barred  from  impos-
ing  criminal disabilities  on whomever  he happened  to choose.  The evenhandedness  function
of the  Due  Process  Clause  thus  has  an  equal  protection  component.  That  component  is,
however, distinct  from  the function  of the Equal Protection  Clause  in providing  special  pro-
tection  for  disadvantaged  groups.

ous.4 2  But  in  its  judicial  interpretation,  the  clause  has  frequently
been  understood  as  an  effort  to  restrict  short-term  or  shortsighted
deviations  from  widely  held  social  norms;  it  has  an  important
backward  looking  dimension.  For  purposes  of  due  process,  the
baseline  for  inquiry  has  tended  to  be  the  common  law,  Anglo-
American  practice,  or  the  status  quo.  The  Due  Process  Clause  is
thus closely  associated  with  the view  that  the  role  of the  Supreme
Court  is  to  limit  dramatic  and  insufficiently  reasoned  change,  to
protect tradition  against  passionate  majorities, and  to bring  a more
balanced  and  disinterested  perspective  to  bear  on  legislation.

The  point  should  not  be  overstated.  There  are  a  number  of
important  qualifications.  Tradition  has not been  and  should  not be
the  exclusive  focus  of  the  Court's  due  process  jurisprudence.  But
this basic  understanding  has played  a  large  role  in  the  Court's  de-
cisions  on  substantive  due  process-a  point  central  to  the  opinion
in Hardwick itself. Indeed,  it  is on the  surface  of many of the most
important  substantive  due  process  cases.  Hence  the  early  incorpo-
ration  decisions  attempted  to  defend  their  outcomes  by  reference
to notions  deeply held  in Anglo-American  law.  In Murray's Lessee
v  Hoboken Land and Improvement Co.,4 3 the  Court  suggested  that
the  content  of  the  Due  Process  Clause  would  be  defined  by  refer-
ence  "to  those  settled  usages  and  modes  of  proceeding  existing  in
the  common  and  statue  [sic]  law of  England  ....
In  Twining v
New  Jersey,45  the  Court  asked  whether  the  right  in  question  is  a
"fundamental  principle  of  liberty  and  justice  which  inheres  in  the
very  idea of free government,"  as to  which tradition  would  be  criti-
cal. 46  In the  most  important  of recent  incorporation  cases,  Duncan
v  Louisiana,47  the  Court  examined  whether  "a  procedure  is  neces-
sary  to  an  Anglo-American  regime  of  ordered  liberty,"  a  question
that would  be  answered  by  an  exploration  of "actual  systems  bear-
ing  virtually  every  characteristic  of  the  common-law  system  that
has  been  developing  contemporaneously  in  England  and  in  this
country.

substantive  due  process  cases  are  rooted  in  similar  instincts.  For
example,  the  Court's  principal  decisions  in  the  Lochner  period
were  based  on  the  Due  Process  Clause.49  In  those  cases,  the  Court
viewed  deviations  from  common  law  standards  with  considerable
skepticism.  Regulation  that  interfered  with  the  existing  allocation
of  property  rights  was  treated  as  impermissibly  partisan  and  as
constitutionally  suspect.5 0  A  large  part  of  the reason  for  this  skep-
ticism  was  that the  relevant  regulation  departed  significantly  from
common  law  norms;  public  law  was  thus  defined  by  reference  to
traditional  private  law.5 1  There  is,  of  course,  a  broad  consensus
that  the  relevant  cases  were  wrongly  decided.  The  central  point
here  is about structure, not about  particular  outcomes.  The  Court's
skepticism  about  departures  from  what  it  perceived  as  historical
understandings  of property  rights  fits  comfortably  with a tradition-
based  conception  of  substantive  due  process.

In  cases  involving  limitations  on  state  court jurisdiction,  the
Court  has  spoken  in  the  same  terms.  In  International Shoe  Co.  v
Washington,5 2  the  Court  said  that  the  question  is  whether  "the
maintenance  of  the  suit"  transgresses  "traditional  notions  of  fair
play  and  substantial  justice."53  Similar  formulations  have  been
used  in  the  more  recent  cases  as  well. 4

The most  controversial  and  important  of the  modern substan-
tive  due  process  cases  of  course  involve  privacy.5  These cases  also
depend  importantly  on references  to  tradition. The  theme  is  made
explicit in the majority  and  concurring  opinions  in Griswold v  Con-
necticut.5 6  It  is  also  present  in  Moore  v  East Cleveland,5 7  where
Justice  Powell  wrote,

decisions  establish  that  the  Constitution  protects  the  sanctity
of the family  precisely  because  the  institution  of the  family  is
deeply  rooted  in  this  Nation's  history  and  tradition. 8

Despite  rhetoric  of  this sort, the  Court's privacy jurisprudence
cannot  be  understood  exclusively  in  these  terms.  It  is  a  familiar
point  that  the  use  of  tradition  has  produced  considerable  awk-
wardness  in  the  cases.  The  principal  difficulty  lies  in  determining
the  contours  and  reach of the  relevant  tradition. Traditions  can  be
described  at  varying  levels  of  generality.  There  may  well  be,  for
example,  a tradition  of respect  for  intimate  association.  The  appli-
cation  of  that  tradition  has  hardly  been  consistent,  however,  and
the  hard  cases  arise  when  the  general  tradition  of  respect  meets  a
particular  context  in  which  the  general  tradition  has  been  repudi-
ated  and,  to  that  extent,  does  not  exist  at  all.  There  is  no  estab-
lished  tradition  of protection  of abortion,  marital privacy,  or  use  of
contraception.  In  the  hard  cases,  part  of  the  question  is  whether
the tradition  should  be  read  at a level  of generality  that  draws  the
particular  practice  into  question.59  Many  of the  important  privacy
cases  read the  role  of  tradition  in  precisely  this  way.

In  short,  the  tradition  cannot  by itself be  controlling  in  close
cases,  and  the constitutional  question must  be  answered  instead by
an  inescapably  normative  inquiry  into  how the relevant  tradition is
best  characterized. 60  As  a result, the tradition  is  sometimes  treated
as  aspirational.  The  Court  has  referred  in  some  key  cases  to
"evolving  standards  of  decency,"  as  to  which  tradition  is  relevant
but  not  dispositive.6'  It  is  for  this  reason,  among  others,  that  the
Court's  decision  in Hardwick itself is  extremely  troublesome.62  In-
deed,  it  is  here  that  the  Hardwick Court  erred  in  its  treatment  of
the privacy  problem.  At  the level  of  generality  that best  explains
such  decisions  as  Roe  and Griswold, the governing  tradition  would

require  far  stronger  justification  than  did  the  Hardwick Court  for
criminal  bans  on  sexual  activity  between  consenting  adults.

The  point  here,  however,  is  not  to  explore  the  relationships
among  tradition, Hardwick, and  the rest  of  the  privacy  cases.  It is
instead  to  suggest  that  the  Due  Process  Clause  has  called  for  an
inquiry  with  a  significant  historical  dimension,  that  the  Hardwick
decision  turned  on  precisely  this fact,  and  that  a large  part of  the
function  of the clause  has  been  to limit  myopic  or  short-term  devi-
ations from  social  convictions  that have been  long  and widely  held.
The  Court's  function  as  provider  of  a "sober  second  thought"6  by
which  to  measure  legislation  is  most evident  in  its  use  of the  Due
Process  Clause.

Since  its  inception,  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  has served  an
entirely  different  set of purposes  from the  Due Process  Clause.  The
Equal  Protection  Clause  is  emphatically  not  an  effort  to  protect
traditionally  held  values  against  novel  or  short-term  deviations.
The  Clause  could  not be  characterized  as  a "nondegradation  prin-
ciple"  designed  to  ensure  that things  will  not  "get  worse." 5  It is
implausible  to  describe  the  role  of  the  Supreme  Court, under  the
Equal  Protection  Clause,  as  the  provision  of  a  sober  second
thought  to  legislation  or  the  defense  of  tradition  against  pent-up
majorities.  The  clause  is  not  backward-looking  at  all;  it  was  self-
consciously  designed to  eliminate  practices  that  existed at the time
of  ratification  and  that  were  expected  to  endure.6

The function  of the  Equal  Protection  Clause  is to  protect  dis-
advantaged  groups,  of  which  blacks  are  the  most  obvious  case,
against  the  effects  of  past  and  present  discrimination  by  political
majorities.  The  scope  of the  Clause  and  the  precise  content  of the
equality  norm  are  of  course  deeply  disputed. 7  But  on  any  view,
the Equal  Protection  Clause  is not rooted  in common  law  or status
quo  baselines,  or  in  Anglo-American  conventions.  The  baseline  is
instead  a  principle  of  equality  that operates  as  a  criticism  of  ex-
isting practice. The  clause  does  not safeguard  traditions; it protects
against  traditions,  however  long-standing  and  deeply  rooted.

This  difference  accounts  for the  fact that  Supreme  Court deci-

sions  that  reject  common  law  or  status  quo  baselines  usually  rely
on the  Equal  Protection  Clause. 8  Cases  involving  the  protection of
disadvantaged  groups  are,  of  course,  the  most  conspicuous  exam-
ples  of  this. 9  But  it  should  be  no  surprise  that the  Equal  Protec-
tion  Clause  has  also  been  the  source  of decision  in  cases  involving
such  matters  as voting  rights,70  access  to  court,71  and  disparities  in
education.

72

This  approach  also  has  implications  for  the  privacy  cases.  In
particular,  it  suggests  that there  is  much to  be  said  in favor  of the
mounting  academic  consensus73  that Roe  v  Wade involved issues  of
sex  discrimination  as  well  as  privacy,  and  that  the  problem  of
abortion might  plausibly have  been approached  in  equal  protection
terms.  Laws  that restrict  reproductive  rights  burden  women  exclu-
sively;  they  are  closely  associated  with  traditional  ideas  about the
role  of women  in  the  raising  of  children,  ideas  that have  played  a
part in  sex  discrimination.  The  reason  that  it  is  both  possible  and
problematic  to treat  cases  involving  reproductive  rights  in terms  of
due  process is  the  same:  the relevant  tradition is highly  ambiguous.
It  may  be  that  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  will  ultimately  prove
to be  a preferable  source  of decision,  though  in order  to  defend  the
outcome  in  Roe,  the  argument  would have  to  be  quite  elaborate.7 4
However  these  more  difficult  questions  may  be  resolved,  there
is  a large  difference  in  the  basic  functions  of the  Due  Process  and
Equal  Protection  Clauses.  The  decision  of the  Court  of Appeals  in
Watkins  therefore  contains  a  lesson  for  doctrinal  development

permit  traditions  that  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  proscribes,
even  if those  traditions  are  rooted  in  discrimination-a  point  that
both  Eisenstadt and  Watkins  make  clear.

This  is  hardly  the  space  for  a  full-scale  defense  of  the  argu-
ment  that  classifications  on  the  basis  of  sexual  orientation  should
be  subject  to  heightened  scrutiny  under  the  Equal  Protection
Clause,  an argument that has been made  in  detail in many places75
And there  is reason  for  uncertainty  about  whether  the  current  Su-
preme  Court  will accept  that argument,  especially  in the  context  of
the  military.70

It  may  be  suggested,  however,  that  the  majority  opinion  in
Watkins correctly  emphasized  the history of discrimination  against
gays  and  lesbians  and  the  likelihood  that  challenged  measures  will
reflect  past  and  present  prejudice.77  Empathetic  identification  on
the  part  of the  majority  is  peculiarly  unusual  in  this setting.  Stat-
utes  and regulations  that  discriminate  on the  basis  of sexual  orien-
tation  often  reflect  fear  and  hostility  that  are  not  susceptible  to
rational justification.78  The rationale  accepted  in Hardwick as  suf-
ficient  for  due  process  purposes-relating  principally  to  tradition-
ally held moral  norms-has  little  or  no weight  in the context  of an
equal  protection  challenge;  consider  the  Court's  rejection  of  such
norms  in  the  areas  of  race  and  sex  discrimination.  The  Watkins
court  also  pointed  to  the  peculiar  difficulty  of  using  political  ave-
nues  to  seek  redress e  and  the  usual  irrelevance  of  sexual  orienta-

lesbians  are  subject  to widespread  social  hostility.  As  a  result,  disclosure  of homosexuality
creates  a series  of risks of social  sanctions,  ranging  from  various forms  of social  ostracism  to
dismissal  from  employment to private violence.  It  is  for  this reason,  among  others, that the
exercise  of political  power  by  gays  and  lesbians  is  unusually  difficult.  See  Ackerman,  98

Ordinary  equal  protection  law,  embodied  in  United States v  Carolene Products Co.,

tion  to  legitimate  governmental  goals.8 0  In  these  respects,  the  pat-
tern  of  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sexual  orientation 
is
strikingly  analogous 
to  the  pattern  of  discrimination  against
blacks.  Particularly  notable  is  the  Watkins  court's  treatment  of
the  relationship  between 
immutability  and  equal  protection
problems."'

The  arguments  used  to  justify  exclusion  of gays  and  lesbians
from  the  military  are  the  same  arguments  that  were  once  used  to
allow  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  race  and  sex.  Those justifica-
tions  refer  primarily  to adverse  effects  on military  morale  and  dis-
cipline,  adverse  effects  that  are  a  product  of  private  biases.82  The
record  in  Watkins suggests  that those  arguments  are  no  more  per-
suasive  here  than there. The general  argument for  heightened  scru-
tiny of classifications  based  on  sexual orientation  applies  regardless
of  the  weight  of  the  justifications  in  particular  cases,  and  regard-
less  of the  possibility  that  the  military  presents  special  considera-
tions  arguing  in favor  of judicial  deference."

It  may  be  useful  to  conclude  by  suggesting  that  the  legal  re-
gime  produced  by  Watkins is  coherent  even  in  the  face  of  Hard-
wick.  Watkins  makes  it  generally  impermissible  to  single  out gays

ence,  and  among  the  most  important  sources  of real  world  political  failure  is  the  undue
influence  of well  organized  private groups  as against diffuse,  poorly organized  majorities.  See
Geoffrey  P. Miller,  The True  Story of Carolene  Products,  1987  S  Ct  Rev  397,  404-06,  422-
28;  Ackerman,  98  Harv  L  Rev  at  734-37  (cited  in  note  75).  The  insights  of modern  public
choice  theory  thus  bear  significantly  on  the  theory  of equal  protection.

It  would  be  a large  mistake,  however,  to  use those insights  in order  to suggest  that equal
protection  problems  can  be  approached  solely  through  a  non-normative  understanding  (as-
suming  that such  a  thing could  be  imagined)  of the problems  of political  organization  in the
particular  case. As  the defining case of blacks  reveals,  the question  whether  a group  deserves
special  solicitude  under  the Equal  Protection  Clause  depends  on an  inescapably  normative
inquiry  into  the  legitimacy  of the  reasons  ordinarily  used  to  disadvantage  that  group.  Al-
though  such  an  inquiry  will  ask  whether  political  organization  is  feasible  in  the  circum-
stances,  it  cannot  be  limited  to  that question.

81  "Although  the  causes  of homosexuality  are  not  fully  understood,  scientific  research

indicates  that we  have  little control  over  our  sexual  orientation  and  that, once  acquired,  our
sexual  orientation  is  largely  impervious  to  change.[citations  omitted].  Scientific  proof aside,
it  seems  appropriate  to  ask  whether  heterosexuals  feel  capable  of changing  their sexual  ori-
entation.  Would  heterosexuals  living  in  a  city  that  passed  an  ordinance  banning  those  who
engaged  in  or desired  to  engage  in  sex  with persons  of the opposite sex  find  it  easy  not only
to  abstain  from  heterosexual  activity  but also  to  shift the  object  of their  sexual  desires  to
persons  of the same  sex?"  847  F2d  at  1347-48  (emphases  in  original).

82  See  Watkins, 847  F2d  at 1350:  "These  concerns  strike  a  familiar  chord.  For much  of
our  history, the  military's  fear of racial  tension  kept  black soldiers  separated  from  whites."
Note  also  that  in  the  context  of  Watkins,  the  concern  about  blackmail  was  quite  weak.

his  or  her  sexual  orientation."  Id  at  1352.

and  lesbians  for  special  disabilities;  differential  treatment  of  that
sort  will  face  a large  burden  of justification.  So  long  as  Hardwick
remains  the  law,  however,  measures  that proscribe  certain  sexual
activities  may be upheld  against a due process  attack so long  as the
prohibitions  apply  regardless  of  sexual  orientation . 4  The  require-
ment  of generality  operates  as  a political  safeguard,  ensuring  that
if the heterosexual  majority is  to burden  gays  and lesbians,  it must
burden  itself  as  well.  In  imposing  this  requirement  of  generality,
the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  as  understood  in  Watkins,  serves  its
most  familiar  and  established  function.

III.  CONCLUSION

The  Watkins  court's interpretation  of Bowers v  Hardwick was
correct.  The  court  of  appeals  in  Padula, and  Judge  Reinhardt  in
his  dissenting  opinion  in  Watkins, misconstrued  the Hardwick de-
cision.  The  conclusion  that the  Due  Process  Clause  does  not  pro-
tect  consensual  homosexual  sodomy  does  not  resolve  the question
whether principles  of equal protection  forbid  discrimination  on the
basis  of  sexual  orientation. 5

I" The  qualification  is necessary  because Hardwick left open  the possibility that hetero-
sexual sodomy  is constitutionally  protected.  According  to the  view presented  here, of course,
an equal protection  attack would  be available  in those jurisdictions that banned  homosexual
but  not  heterosexual  sodomy.  See  note  26.  But see  Baker v  Wade,  769  F2d  289  (5th  Cir
1985)  (en banc)  (upholding such a statute).  Watkins itself need not be understood  to go that
far, however,  since  the  decision  applies  to  distinctions  based  on  sexual  orientation  rather
than  on  the nature  of sexual  acts.

85 For purposes of the present discussion, I put to one side  some  of the other  difficulties
with using Hardwick to  dispose  of claims  of unconstitutional  discrimination  on the  basis of
sexual  orientation.  To list just  a few:

(1) Sometimes  a  civil  disability  might  be  imposed  on gays  and  lesbians  in jurisdictions
in which  there  is no  criminal  prohibition  on homosexual  acts.  In  such a jurisdiction, Hard-
wick  is  of uncertain  relevance.  It  is  by  no  means  clear  that the  fact  that the  state  could
criminalize  the  relevant  acts  is  sufficient  to  support  discrimination  in  circumstances  in
which  the state  has  chosen  to impose  no  such  criminal  disability.

(2)  It is  unclear  that  the  state's power  to criminalize  homosexual  acts  includes  the  au-
thority  to  impose  unique  or  distinctive  civil  disabilities  on  a  class  of people  that  includes
many who  engage  in  such  acts.  Imagine,  for  example,  a  law  prohibiting  gays  and  lesbians
from teaching in the public schools.  Even  if homosexual  acts  may be criminalized,  it remains
necessary  to  explain  why  a  class  including  many  who  engage  in  such  acts,  and  not  other
criminal acts,  are being forced  to suffer  civil  sanctions.  The problem becomes  more severe  in
light of the  fact that the civil  sanctions  appear  weakly  related to  legitimate  state purposes.
(3) Discrimination  against  people  of homosexual  orientation  is  different  from  discrimi-
nation  against  people  who  engage  in  acts  that  are  and  can  constitutionally  be  criminal-
ized-as the  Watkins court  emphasized.  The  difference  is  important  in  at least  two  ways.
First,  members  of  the  relevant  class  may  not  have  engaged  in  the  prohibited  acts  at  all.
Second,  discrimination  on the basis of sexual  orientation has  some  of the characteristics  of a
status  offense  as prohibited  in  Robinson v California, 370  US  660  (1962).

The  conclusion  of the  Watkins  court  also  contains  a large  and
often  overlooked  lesson  about  the  relationship  between  the  Due
Process  and  Equal  Protection  Clauses.  The  Due  Process  Clause  is
backward-looking;  a  large  part  of  its  reach  is  defined  by reference
to  tradition.  The  clause  is  closely  associated  with,  even  if  not lim-
ited  to, the  view that  the role  of the  Court is  to protect  against  ill-
considered  or  short-term  departures  from  time-honored  practices.
The Equal Protection  Clause, by contrast, is grounded in  a norm  of
equality  that operates  largely  as  a critique  of traditional  practices.
The  Watkins  decision  provides  reason  to  believe  that  constitu-
tional  protection  against  discrimination  on  the  basis  of sexual  ori-
entation  will  ultimately  take  place  under  the  Equal  Protection
Clause.  It should  be unsurprising  if such  developments  occur  even
in  the  wake  of Bowers  v  Hardwick.

A  detailed  assessment  of arguments  of this sort would, however,  go  far beyond  the sub-

ject  of this essay.
