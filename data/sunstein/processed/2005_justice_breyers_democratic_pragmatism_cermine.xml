      <title>Justice Breyer’s Democratic Pragmatism</title>
      <p>Cass R. Sunstein*</p>
      <p>There have been many efforts to reconcile judicial review with democratic self-government.
Some such efforts attempt to justify judicial review if and to the extent that it promotes self-rule.
Active Liberty, by Justice Stephen Breyer, is in this tradition; but it is also marked by a heavy
pragmatic orientation, emphasizing as it does the need for close attention to purposes and to the
importance of consequences to legal interpretation. Its distinctiveness lies in its effort to forge
close connections among three seemingly disparate ideas: a democratic account of judicial
review; a purposive understanding of legal texts; and a neo-pragmatic emphasis on
consequences. Breyer’s argument is convincing insofar as it challenges “originalist” approach
on pragmatic grounds. It is more vulnerable insofar it downplays the inevitable role of judicial
discretion in the characterization of purposes and the evaluation of consequences. Those who
emphasize consequences, and active liberty, might well end up embracing textualism, or even
broad judicial deference to legislative majorities. Moreover, it is not simple to deduce, from the
general idea of “active liberty,” concrete conclusions on the issues that concern Breyer, such as
affirmative action, campaign finance reform, privacy rights, and commercial advertising. Many
competing approaches to these issues, and to interpretation as a whole, can also march proudly
under the pragmatic banner.</p>

      <p>The pragmatic method is primarily a method of settling metaphysical disputes that
otherwise might be interminable. Is the world one or many?—fated or free?—material or
spiritual?—here are notions either of which may or may not hold good of the world; and
disputes over such notions are unending. The pragmatic method in such cases is to try to
interpret each notion by tracing its respective practical consequences. What difference
would it practically make to any one if this notion rather than that notion were true?

      <title>Preliminaries: Judicial Review and Democracy</title>
      <p>Throughout the nation’s history, many of the most prominent constitutional
theorists have tried to reconcile judicial review with the national commitment to
democratic self-rule. They have argued that if the Supreme Court acts in a certain way, it
can coexist comfortably with democracy after all.3 Much of this work is highly
conceptual—more theoretical than pragmatic, in the sense that abstract ideas, rather than
concrete consequences, are in the foreground.</p>
      <p>Early in the twentieth century, for example, James Bradley Thayer emphasized
democratic considerations in order to argue that the Supreme Court should strike down
legislation only “when those who have the right to make laws have not merely made a
mistake, but have made a very clear one,—so clear that it is not open to rational
believed that courts should take the same approach to challenged legislation that juries
take to criminal defendants; thus he argued that the Supreme Court should uphold the
actions of the elected branches unless their invalidity is “very plain and clear, clear
beyond a reasonable doubt.”6 Thayer’s view was largely followed by Oliver Wendell
Holmes, perhaps the greatest figure in the history of American law, who generally agreed
with his plea for judicial deference to the legislature. In Holmes words, “If my fellow
citizens want to go to Hell I’ll help them. It’s my job.”7 Unlike Thayer, Holmes was
inspired by pragmatism,8 but his own arguments, at least as they appeared in judicial
opinions, were quite abstract.9 In the period after Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal,
Thayer’s approach had a significant role on the Supreme Court,10 embraced as it
generally was by Felix Frankfurter,11 Holmes’ disciple. 12</p>
      <p>To many people, the idea of judicial deference to the elected branches lost much
of its theoretical appeal in the 1950s and 1960s, when the Supreme Court, under the
leadership of Chief Justice Earl Warren, was invalidating school segregation,13 protecting
freedom of speech,14 striking down poll taxes,15 requiring a rule of one person, one
vote,16 and protecting accused criminals against police abuse.17 Is it possible to defend
the Warren Court against the charge that its decisions were fatally undemocratic? The
most elaborate effort came from John Hart Ely, the Warren Court’s most celebrated
expositor and defender, who famously argued for what he called a
“representationreinforcing” approach to judicial review.18 Like Thayer, Ely emphasized the central
importance of democratic self-rule. But Ely famously insisted that if self-rule is really our
loadstar, then unqualified judicial deference to legislatures is utterly senseless. Some
rights, Ely argued, are indispensable to self-rule, and the Court legitimately protects those
rights not in spite of democracy but in its name.19 The right to vote and the right to speak
are the central examples. Courts promote democracy when they protect those rights.</p>
      <p>Ely went much further. He argued that some groups are at a systematic
disadvantage in the democratic process, and that when courts protect “discrete and insular
minorities,” they are reinforcing democracy too.20 Ely was particularly concerned with
African-Americans, whom he saw as unable to protect themselves in politics. But with
some qualifications, his plea for judicial protection extended to other groups as well.21
And while Ely was clearly concerned with consequences, his argument stressed
democracy’s preconditions, and indeed the general idea of equal concern and respect.22</p>
      <p>A third theory of constitutional interpretation, stressed most prominently by
Justice Antonin Scalia23 and also favored by Clarence Thomas,24 is “originalism.”
Invoking both self-government and the rule of law, originalists believe that the
Constitution should be interpreted to mean what it meant at the time that it was ratified. If
the Equal Protection Clause was originally understood to permit sex discrimination, then
courts should permit sex discrimination. If the Second Amendment was originally
understood to forbid gun control, then courts should forbid gun control. When President
Bush praises “strict construction,” many people take him to be embracing originalism. 25
Originalists like Scalia do not follow Thayer’s approach, because they are quite prepared
to strike down legislation that violates the original understanding. Originalists do not
defend Ely’s idea of “representation-reinforcing” judicial review. But in their own way,
originalists too prize democracy. They emphasize that the Constitution was ratified by
We the People, who have sovereign authority, and they want to limit the discretion of
federal judges, who are after all unelected.26</p>
      <p>It is true that those who ratified the Constitution are long dead, and this point
might be thought to create a real problem for originalists who attempt to defend their
approach on democratic grounds. Why—in the name of self-government?—should
current citizens be bound by those who lived long ago? But democracy is central to
originalist thinking about constitutional law.27 Above all, originalists fear that if judges
do not follow the original understanding, they will be creating the Constitution anew,
because they will give it the content of their own choosing. Originalist arguments are not
always pragmatic in spirit. On the contrary, they can be highly abstract, stressing
considerations of legitimacy.28 But some originalists are aware that their approach would
have
dramatic
and
perhaps intolerable
consequences.29</p>
      <p>Inspired
by
pragmatic
considerations, they are willing to attempt to reduce that risk.30</p>

27 See Cass R. Sunstein, Justice Scalia’s Democratic Formalism, 107 Yale LJ 529 (1997).
28 See Robert Bork, The Tempting of America (1985); some of the arguments in Scalia, A Matter of
Interpretation, are in the same vein. Consider this passage: “The principal theoretical defect of
nonoriginalism, in my view, is its incompatibility with the very principle that legitimizes judicial review of
constitutionality. . . . I take the need for theoretical legitimacy seriously, and even if one assumes (as many
nonoriginalists do not even bother to do) that the Constitution was originally meant to expound evolving
rather than permanent values, . . . I see no basis for believing that supervision of the evolution would have
been committed to the courts. At an even more general theoretical level, originalism seems to me more
compatible with the nature and purpose of a Constitution in a democratic system.”</p>
      <p>29 See Scalia, The Lesser Evil, supra note: “I can be much more brief in describing what seems to me
the second most serious objection to originalism: In its undiluted form, at least, it is medicine that seems
too strong to swallow. Thus, almost every originalist would adulterate it with the doctrine of state
decisis-so that Marbury v. Madison would stand even if Professor Raoul Berger should demonstrate unassailably
that it got the meaning of the Constitution wrong. . . . But stare decisis alone is not enough to prevent
originalism from being what many would consider too bitter a pill. What if some state should enact a new
law providing public lashing, or branding of the right hand, as punishment for certain criminal offenses?
Even if it could be demonstrated unequivocally that these were not cruel and unusual measures in 1791,
and even though no prior Supreme Court decision has specifically disapproved them, I doubt whether any</p>

      <title>II. Pragmatism, Consequences, and Active Liberty</title>
      <p>As a law professor at Harvard Law School, Stephen Breyer specialized in
administrative law. His important work in that field was marked above all by its
unmistakably pragmatic foundations.31 Indeed, one of his major innovations lay in an
insistence on the importance of evaluating traditional doctrines not in a vacuum, but in
light of the concrete effects of regulation on the real world.32 Hence Breyer argued for a
close connection between administrative law and regulatory policy.33 While some of his
work touched on the separation of powers,34 constitutional law was not his field. But as a
member of the Supreme Court, Breyer has slowly been developing a distinctive approach
of his own, one that also has a pragmatic dimension, and that can be seen as directly
responsive to his colleague Scalia and to originalism.</p>
      <p>This book announces and develops that theory. Its most distinctive feature is its
effort to connect three seemingly disparate claims. The first is an insistence that judicial
review can and should be undertaken with close reference to active liberty and to
democratic goals, a point with clear links to Ely’s work. The second is an emphasis on
the centrality of “purposes” to legal interpretation, a point rooted in the great legal
process materials of Henry Hart and Albert Sacks and in particular their brilliant note on
statutory interpretation.35 The third is a claim about the need to evaluate theories of legal
interpretation with close reference to their consequences, a point whose foundations can
be found in American pragmatism.36</p>
      <p>As we shall see, much of the interest of Breyer’s book lies in its effort to integrate
these three claims. I shall be raising questions about that effort, above all on two grounds.

eighth amendment challenge.”</p>
      <p>30 Note here that Justice Scalia confesses, “I hasten to confess that in a crunch I may prove a
fainthearted originalist. I cannot imagine myself, any more than any other federal judge, upholding a statute that
imposes the punishment of flogging.” See id.</p>

First, those who emphasize active liberty and democratic self-government might well
reject a purposive approach to interpretation, including purposive interpretation of the
Constitution. Second, those who believe in the importance of consequences might well be
drawn to an approach very different from Breyer’s, including textualism, Thayerism, and
perhaps even originalism. Breyer’s arguments are unfailingly reasonable; the question is
whether his general commitments are enough to justify his particular conclusions. Let us
now turn to some details.
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>A. Theory</title>
      <p>Breyer’s organizing theme is “active liberty,” which he associates with the right
of self-governance. It is noteworthy that in his own judicial work, Breyer is plausibly
seen as the most consistently democratic member of the Rehnquist Court: Among its nine
members, he has shown the highest percentage of votes to uphold acts of Congress37 and
also to defer to the decisions of the executive branch.38 And indeed, a great deal of his
book is a plea for judicial caution and deference.39 But Breyer does not mean to follow
Thayer; he does not say that the Court should uphold legislation whenever the
Constitution is unclear. Like Ely, Breyer does not rule out the view that courts should
take an aggressive role in some areas, above all in order to protect democratic governance
(p. 11).</p>
      <p>His short book comes in three parts. The first builds on Benjamin Constant’s
famous distinction between the liberty of the ancients and the liberty of the moderns (pp.
3-7).40 The liberty of the ancients involves “active liberty”—the right to share in the
exercise of sovereign power. Quoting Constant, Breyer refers to the hope that the sharing
of that power would “ennoble” the people’s “thoughts and establish among them a kind
of intellectual equality which forms the glory and power of a free people” (p. 4). But
Constant also prized negative liberty, meaning “individual independence” from
government authority. As Breyer describes Constant’s view, which he firmly endorses, it
is necessary to have both forms of freedom, and thus “to combine the two together” (p.
5).41</p>
      <p>Breyer believes that the founders of the Constitution did exactly that. His special
emphasis is on what Constant called “an active and constant participation in public
power.”42 That form of participation includes voting, town meetings, and the like; but it
also requires that citizens receive information and education, in order to promote their
capacity to ensure effective governance. In Breyer’s view, the citizens of
postrevolutionary America insisted on highly democratic forms of state government,
promoting popular control. Breyer is aware of the highly ambivalent experiences of
postrevolutionary governments; he know that some commentators have rejected the view that
the Constitution is a democratic document.43 Nonetheless, he believes that the founders of
the Constitution accepted the deepest aspirations of the American Revolution, creating a
framework with a “basically democratic outlook” (p. 25).</p>
      <p>After all, the document begins with the words, “We the People,” and in Breyer’s
view, its very structure is a testimonial to active liberty. Both the House and the Senate
are subject to electoral control. Even with the electoral college, the choice of the
President is ultimately traceable to voters, not to an unaccountable elite. Breyer thinks
that the whole system is “difficult to reconcile with a retreat from democratic principle.”
On the contrary, he claims that the Constitution can be viewed “as focusing first and
foremost upon ‘active liberty.’” He thinks that constitutional interpretation should be
undertaken with close reference to that overriding constitutional purpose.44</p>
      <p>In Breyer’s account, the Warren Court appreciated active liberty, and it attempted
to make that form of liberty more real for all Americans (p. 11). By contrast, the
Rehnquist Court may have pushed the pendulum too far back in the other direction (id.).
In short, Breyer believes that an appreciation of active liberty has concrete implications
for a wide range of modern disputes.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>B. Applications</title>
      <p>The second part of his book traces those implications. He begins with free speech.
An obvious question is whether the Court should be hostile or receptive to campaign
finance reform. With his eye directly on the democratic ball, Breyer suggests that if we
focus on the “the Constitution’s basic structural objective, ‘participatory
selfgovernment’” (p. 46), then we will be receptive to restrictions on campaign contributions.
A central reason is that such restrictions “seek to democratize the influence that money
can bring upon the electoral process” (p. 47). He thinks that some of his colleague s, most
prominently Rehnquist and Scalia, have been quite mistaken to invoke negative liberty as
a rigid barrier to campaign finance restrictions. In the same vein, he insists that the free
speech principle, seen in terms of active liberty, gives special protection to political
speech, and significantly less protection to commercial advertising. He criticizes his
colleagues on the Court for protecting advertising with the aggressiveness that they have
shown in recent years. His purposive interpretation of freedom of speech thus emphasizes
democratic self-government above all.45</p>
      <p>Affirmative action might seem to have little to do with active liberty. At first
glance, it poses a conflict between the ideal of color-blindness and what Breyer calls a
“narrowly purposive” (p. 80) understanding of the Equal Protection Clause, one that
emphasizes the historical mistreatment of African-Americans. Directly disagreeing with
some of his colleagues,46 Breyer endorses the narrowly purposive approach. But he also
contends that in permitting affirmative action at educational institutions, the Court has
been centrally concerned with democratic self-government. The reason, pragmatic in
character, is that “some form of affirmative action” is “necessary to maintain a
wellfunctioning participatory democracy” (p. 81). Breyer points to the Court’s emphasis on
the role of broad access to education in “sustaining our political and cultural heritage”
and in promoting diverse leadership. Underlining those points, Breyer argues that the
Court’s decision to permit affirmative action made a direct appeal “to principles of
fraternity , to principles of active liberty” (p. 82). In Breyer’s view, it should be no
surprise that the Court selected an interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause that
would, as a pragmatic matter, promote rather than undermine the operation of democracy.
As serious problem with the attack on affirmative action is that it would produce
intolerable consequences.</p>
      <p>With respect to privacy, Breyer’s emphasis is on the novelty of new technologies
and the rise of unanticipated questions about how to balance law enforcement needs
against the interest in keeping personal information private. Because of the difficulty of
those problems, Breyer argues, on pragmatic grounds, for “a special degree of judicial
modesty and caution.” He wants to avoid a “premature judicial decision” that would risk
“short-circuiting, or pre-empting, the ‘conversational law-making process.” Hence his
plea is for narrow, cautious judicial rulings that do not lay out long-term solutions. In
Breyer’s view, such rulings serve active liberty, because they refuse to “limit legislative
options in ways now unforeseeable.” By its very nature, a narrow ruling is unlikely to
“interfere with any ongoing democratic policy debate.” His argument here is important,
because other members of the Court, most notably Scalia, have objected to narrow
rulings on the ground that they leave too much uncertainty for the future.47</p>
      <p>Some of the most noteworthy decisions of the Rehnquist Court have attempted to
limit the power of Congress. 48 For example, the Court has struck down the Violence
Against Women Act as beyond congressional authority under the Commerce Clause.49 It
has also announced an “anti-commandeering” principle, one that forbids the national
government from requiring state legislatures to enact laws.50 In the abstract, those
decisions seem to promote active liberty, because they decrease the authority of the more
remote national government, and because they promote participation and self-government
at the local level. Breyer is no critic of federalism or defender of centralized government.
He agrees that the federal system fits with his general theme, because that system makes
“it easier for citizens to hold government officials accountable” and because it brings
“government closer to home.”
47 See, e.g. Antonin Scalia, The Rule of Law is a Law of Rules, 56 U Chi L Rev 1175 (1989).
48 United States v. Morrison, 529 US 598 (2000).
49 Id
50 New York v US, 505 US 144 (1992).</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, he strongly objects to the Court’s recent federalism decisions. With
respect to congressional enactments, “the public has participated in the legislative process
at the national level, ” and hence active liberty calls for deference by the Court. Breyer’s
special target is the anti-commandeering principle. Speaking in heavily pragmatic terms,
Breyer thinks that this prohibition prevents valuable national initiatives to protect against
terrorism, environmental degradation, and natural disasters—initiatives in which, for
example, the national government requires state officials to ensure compliance with
federal standards (p. 60).</p>
      <p>Breyer also contends that an understanding of active liberty can inform more
technical debates. Here is a prominent example: In Chevron v. NRDC,51 the Court
announced a principle of deference to administrative interpretations of law. The Court
ruled that in the face of statutory ambiguity, courts should defer to agency interpretations
so long as they are reasonable. Breyer believes that this approach is too simple and too
crude, in a way that disserves democracy itself.52 When the agency has solved an
interstitial question, Breyer believes that judicial deference is appropriate, because
deference is what a reasonable legislature would want. But on “questions of major
importance” (p. 107), involving the fundamental reach or nature of the statute, Breyer
thinks that a reasonable legislature would not want courts to accept the agency’s
interpretation. He thus urges that courts should take a firmer hand in reviewing agency
judgments on fundamental matters than in reviewing more routine matters. Here too, he
opposes Justice Scalia, who endorses a broad reading of Chevron, one that would
generally defer to agency interpretations of law.53 In democracy’s name, Breyer argues
on behalf of independent judicial review of agency interpretations involving major
national questions.</p>
      <p>There is a larger interpretive question in the background. Should courts rely only
on a statute’s literal text, or should they place an emphasis instead “on statutory purpose
and congressional intent”? Sharply disagreeing with the more textually-oriented Scalia,54
and again emphasizing pragmatic considerations, Breyer favors purpose and intent. Here
he is evidently influenced by the famous legal process materials, compiled by Henry Hart
and Albert Sacks; as I have noted, those materials place “purpose” front and center, and
they also insist that courts should assume that legislators are “reasonable people acting
reasonably.”55 In the same vein, Breyer emphasizes that a purpose-based approach asks
courts to consider the goals of “the ‘reasonable Member of Congress’—a legal fiction
that applies, for example, even when Congress did not in fact consider a particular
problem.”56</p>
      <p>In defending this approach, Breyer speaks in thoroughly pragmatic terms,
emphasizing the beneficial consequences of purposivism. Breyer thinks that as compared
with a single-minded focus on literal text, his approach will tend to make the law more
sensible, almost by definition. He also contends that it “helps to implement the public’s
will and is therefore consistent with the Constitution’s democratic purpose.” Breyer
concludes that an emphasis on legislative purpose “means that laws will work better for
the people they are presently meant to affect. Law is tied to life; and a failure to
understand how a statute is so tied can undermine the very human activity that the law
seeks to benefit” (p. 100). Thus Breyer directly links active liberty, purposive approaches
to law, and an emphasis on consequences.</p>
      <p>The third part of Breyer’s book tackles the broadest questions of interpretive
theory and directly engages Scalia’s contrary view. Breyer explicitly emphasizes that he
means to draw attention to purposes and consequences above all. Constitutional
provisions, he thinks, have “certain basic purposes,” and they should be understood in
light of those purposes and the broader democratic goals that infuse the Constitution as a
whole. In addition, consequences are “an important yardstick to ensure a given
interpretation’s faithfulness to these democratic purposes.” Breyer is fully aware that
many people, including his colleagues Scalia and Thomas, are drawn to “textualism” and
its close cousin “originalism”—approaches that argue in favor close attention to the

        . Thus Hart and Sacks offer “A Concise Statement of the Task,” which begins, “Decide what purpose
ought to be attributed to the statute and to any subordinate provision of it which may be involved,” id at

meaning of legal terms at the time that were enacted. Scalia , Thomas, and their followers
are likely to think that Breyer’s approach is an invitation for open-ended judicial
lawmaking, in a way that compromises his own democratic aspirations.57 But he offers
several responses.
      </p>
      <p>First, originalist judges claim to follow history, but they cannot easily
demonstrate that history in fact favors their preferred method. The Constitution does not
say that it should be interpreted to mean what it meant when it was ratified. The
document itself enshrines no particular theory of interpretation; it does not mandate
originalism. And if originalism cannot be defended by reference to the intentions and
understandings of the framers, Breyer asks, in what way can it be defended—“other than
in an appeal to consequences?” He points out that the most sophisticated originalists
ultimately argue that their approach will have good consequences—by, for example,
stabilizing the law and deterring judges from imposing their own views. Even Breyer’s
originalist adversaries are “consequentialist in an important sense” (p. 118). They are not
consequentialists in particular cases, but they adopt, and defend, their preferred approach
on consequentialist grounds.58</p>
      <p>Breyer’s second argument is that his own approach does not leave courts at sea,
for he too insists that judges must take account of “the legal precedents, rules, standards,
practices, and institutional understanding that a decision will affect.” Those who focus on
consequences will not favor frequent or dramatic legal change, simply because stability is
important. In any case textualism and originalism cannot avoid the problem of judicial
discretion. “Which historical account shall we use? Which tradition shall we apply?” (p.
127). In the end, Breyer contends that the real problem with textualism and originalism is
that they “may themselves produce seriously harmful consequences—outweighing
whatever risks of subjectivity or uncertainty [are] inherent in other approaches” (p. 129).
His pragmatic goal is “a form of democratic government that will prove workable over

      <p>58 See id; see also the candid suggestion by Randy Barnett, a self-described originalist, see Randy
Barnett, Restoring the Lost Constitution (2004): “Given a sufficiently good constitutional text, originalists
maintain that better results will be reached overall if government officials—including judges—must stick
to the original meaning rather than empowering them to trump that meaning with one that they prefer,”

most likely to promote that goal.</p>

      <title>III. Characterizing Purposes or Ensuring Active Liberty? Some Pragmatic</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-8">
      <title>Questions</title>
      <p>This is a brisk, lucid, and energetic book, written with conviction and offering a
central argument that is at once provocative and appealing. It is not usual for a member of
the Supreme Court to attempt to set out a general approach to his job; Breyer’s effort
must be ranked among the very few most impressive such efforts in the nation’s long
history. And in defending a pragmatic, purposive-oriented alternative to originalism,
Breyer writes in a way that is unfailingly civil and generous to those who disagree with
him—and thus provides a model for how respectful argument might occur, even in a
domain that is intensely polarized.</p>
      <p>A large difficulty, as we shall soon see, lies in the characterization of purposes,
both in particular cases and in general. Texts rarely announce their own purposes; the
same is true of the Constitution itself. When Breyer asks judges to identity the purposes
of reasonable legislators, he is inviting a degree of judicial discretion in the judgment of
what purposes are reasonable. And while he is not wrong to say that “active liberty”
helped inform the founding document, his own characterization of its purposes has a
strong evaluative element. The same is true for the effort to bring active liberty to bear on
concrete cases.</p>
      <p>There is a further point. Breyer emphasizes consequences, and rightly so. But
those who think that consequences are important might well end up favoring approaches
that he rejects, such as textualism, judicial deference to legislative judgments,59 respect
for agency interpretations of law, and even originalism. To be sure, consequences cannot
be assessed without some theory of value, and Breyer wants to use active liberty as part
of the standard for assessment. But it is both to impossible both to use active liberty as
the basis for evaluating consequences and to think that courts do best if they follow the
ordinary meaning of statutory texts, or defer to agency interpretations of the most
important questions, or uphold legislation unless it is plainly unconstitutional.</p>
      <p>59 For a consequentialist defense of such deference, see Adrian Vermeule, Judging Under Uncertainty
(forthcoming 2006.</p>
      <p>I do not believe that these are decisive objections to Breyer’s particular
conclusions or even to his general approach. But they suggest that the defense of those
conclusions, and of that approach, must be cast in a way that acknowledges that much of
the time, reasonable purposes are made, not found. And on both pragmatic and
democratic grounds, that acknowledgement raises some questions about the search for
purposes by the federal judiciary. It is possible that we are all pragmatists now.60 If so,
the problem is that many different approaches, and not only Breyer’s, can march under
the pragmatic banner.61 Breyer does not give adequate attention to the possibility that
alternative approaches, especially in the domains of statutory interpretation and
administrative law, might be powerfully defended on the very grounds that Breyer
invokes.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-9">
      <title>A. Originalism and Consequences</title>
      <p>Breyer’s specific conclusions do make a great deal of sense; they are eminently
reasonable. In the domain of personal privacy, for example, the Court should be aware of
how little it knows about current technological developments, and narrow rulings have
the valuable feature of avoiding premature solutions.62 In general, Breyer makes a
sensible plea for judicial restraint, and it is most illuminating to hear that plea from one of
the Court’s “liberals.” Indeed, Breyer’s survey of particular areas is unified by a general
theme, which involves the need for courts to respect democratic prerogatives. But his
largest claim is more general still: Any approach to legal interpretation must be defended
60 Note in this connection that Judge Richard Posner is a famous pragmatist, and his own approach to
law is very different from Justice Breyer’s, certainly insofar as Posner does not stress citizen participation
or active liberty. See Richard A. Posner, Law, Pragmatism, and Democracy 57-96 (2003); Richard A.
Posner, Foreword, Harv L Rev (forthcoming 2005). Posner describes his own position as “everyday
pragmatism,” id. at 24-25, 49-56, as distinguished from philosophical pragmatism, and Posner tries to avoid
theoretically ambitious claims. He describes everyday pragmatism as “the untheorized cultural outlook of
most Americans, one rooted in the usages and attitudes of a brash, fast-moving, competitive,
forwardlooking, commercial, materialistic, philistine society, with its emphasis on working hard and getting
ahead.” An obvious objection to “untheorized” pragmatism is that it is not possible to evaluate
consequences without a contested judgment of value; and Posner’s own description of the “untheoretized
culture outlook of most Americans” does suggest some kind of theoretical position. But this objection
should not be overstated. It is often possible, however, for people to make a particular evaluation of
consequences amidst disagreement or uncertainty about foundational questions. See Cass R. Sunstein,
Legal Reasoning and Political Conflict (1996).</p>
      <p>61 See, e.g., Adrian Vermeule, Judging Under Uncertainty (forthcoming 2006), which defends a form
of Thayerism on pragmatic grounds.</p>
      <p>62 See Lawrence Lessig, The Path of Cyberlaw, 104 Yale LJ 1743 (1995).
in a way that plays close attention to its consequences. Despite its simplicity, this
pragmatic point continues to be widely ignored. It has particular implications for the
analysis of originalism.</p>
      <p>Of course there is a lively historical dispute about whether those who ratified the
Constitution meant to hold posterity to their specific views.63 If the ratifiers did not want
to bind posterity to their particular understandings, originalism stands defeated on its own
premises: The original understanding may have been that the original understanding is
not binding. Breyer properly notes this possibility (p. 117), and if the historical record
shows that the ratifiers rejected originalism, the argument for originalism is
selfdefeating. But suppose that the ratifiers had no clear view on that question, or even that
the better understanding is that they did, in fact, want to hold posterity to their
understandings.64 Even if so, it is up to us, and not to them, to decide whether to follow
those views. It would be circular and therefore unhelpful to defend reliance on the
ratifiers’ specific views on the ground that the ratifiers wanted us to respect their specific
views.</p>
      <p>It follows that the question whether originalism is a sensible approach to
constitutional law must be answered by reference to its consequences.65 Suppose that the
consequence of originalism</p>
      <p>would be to threaten many contemporary rights and
understandings. If so, why should we accept it66? And indeed it does seem probable that
originalism would have this consequence. For example, it would likely mean that the
national government could discriminate on the basis of race and sex, simply because the
equal protection clause does not apply to the national government at all. Originalism
would almost certainly authorize states to discriminate on the basis of sex, which the
equal protection clause was not originally understood to forbid. Originalism might well
mean that Brown v. Bd of Education was wrongly decided67; it would almost certainly
eliminate the right of privacy altogether, simply because there is no such right in the
document, and it is hard to show that the original understanding of any relevant provision
supports the privacy right. And many originalists firmly believe that their approach
would require courts to invalidate a great deal of legislation—by, for example, striking
down independent regulatory agencies,68 forbidding Congress from delegating discretion
to regulatory agencies,69 and imposing new limitations on national power under the
commerce clause.70</p>
      <p>I do not mean to say that the originalist method necessarily compels all of these
conclusions; the interpretive questions are complex, not simple. And even if originalism
has these consequences, some originalists candidly acknowledge that established
precedent has its claims, and that it must sometimes be respected even if it deviates from
the original understanding. Justice Scalia, for example, says that he might well be a
“faint-hearted” originalist,71 because he is willing to follow precedent even when he
believes that it is wrong in principle.72 My only point is that Breyer is correct to note that
the document itself does not require originalism and to argue that consequences matter to
the choice of a theory of interpretation—and to insist that if we care about consequences,
the argument for originalism looks increasingly implausible.73

section five of the fourteenth amendment, Congress had the authority to abolish segregation. But it is one
thing to say that many members of Congress so believed, and expressed that view in unenacted legislation;
it is quite another thing to say that the fourteenth amendment was understood to create a self-executing,
judicial enforceable ban on segregation.</p>

      <title>B. Second-Order Pragmatism? Of Purposes and Texts</title>
      <p>Breyer offers a sketch, not a sustained argument, and he leaves significant gaps.
Above all, he says too little about the difficulties that judges face in assessing
consequences and in describing purposes. We can describe this as a pragmatic objection
to his approach—an objection that might argue in favor of second-order pragmatism, that
is, a form of pragmatism that is alert to institutional considerations.74 Let us begin with
some technical issues.</p>
      <p>Recall that Breyer argues against a broad reading of Chevron; he believes that for
major questions, courts should make an independent assessment of statutory meaning,
and not defer to reasonable interpretations by the executive branch. But why? The answer
appears to be that reasonable legislators would want courts to assume an independent role
(p. 106). But is this so clear? Assume that a statute—say, the Endangered Species Act, or
the Food and Drug Act—contains an ambiguous provision on an issue of national
importance. Might not reasonable legislators want a specialized, accountable agency to
resolve the ambiguity, even on major questions?</p>
      <p>On pragmatic grounds, it might be thought that resolution of the ambiguity often
calls for a difficult policy judgment, and reasonable legislatures might not want difficult
policy judgments to be made by federal courts.75 On consequentialist grounds, consider
the following fact: In reviewing agency interpretations of law, Republican appointees to
the federal bench show a definite “tilt” in a conservative direction, and Democratic
appointees should a definite “tilt” in a liberal direction.76 Why would we think that a
reasonable legislator would want statutory ambiguities to be resolved in accordance with
whatever “tilt” can be found on the relevant reviewing court? Or consider an additional
fact: A more refined approach to Chevron, of the sort that Breyer celebrates, has
produced a great deal of confusion in the lower courts.77 Does pragmatism support that
outcome?</p>
      <p>In short, it is not clear that in this context, Breyer has properly identified the
(hypothetical, constructed) instructions of a reasonable legislator; but the important point
is far more general. For interpreting statutes, Breyer follows Hart and Sacks in arguing in
favor of close attention to purposes, understood as the objectives of a “reasonable
legislator.” Sometimes this approach is indeed useful, especially where there is a
consensus on what reasonableness requires.78 But Hart and Sacks, writing in the
consensus-pervaded (and complacent) legal culture of the 1950s, downplayed the
possibility that disagreement, highly ideological in nature, would break out on that
question. In the current period, it should be obvious that different judges may well
disagree about what a reasonable legislator would like to do. Imagine that a law
condemns “discrimination on the basis of sex”; suppose that a state adopts a height and
weight requirement for police officers, one that excludes far more women than men. In
deciding whether this requirement is “discrimination,” how shall judges characterize the
purpose of a reasonable legislator? It is inevitable that courts will see their own preferred
view as reasonable. Does that promote active liberty? Does pragmatism support a
situation in which judges assess reasonableness by their own lights?</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the problem is common. Laws rarely come with clear
announcements of their purposes, and in hard cases, any characterization requires some
kind of evaluative judgment from courts. It is not a matter of finding something. Suppose
that the antidiscrimination statute is invoked against affirmative action programs.79 Does
the purpose of the ban on “discrimination” argue for, or against, such programs? It would
be easy to characterize the purpose as the elimination of any consideration of race from
the relevant domain; it would also be easy to characterize the purpose as the protection of
traditionally disadvantaged groups.80 If judges are asked to say what “reasonable”
legislators would like to do, they are all too likely to say what they themselves would like
to do.</p>
      <p>Hart and Sacks, Breyer’s predecessors, do offer a powerful and sensible approach
to statutory interpretation, but they devote too little attention to the problem of
characterizing purpose. When courts choose one purpose over another (reasonable)
candidate, they are actually attempting to put the relevant text in the best constructive
light.81 Of course they are selecting an interpretation that fits the text and context; if they
were not doing that, they would not be engaging in interpretation at all. But when they
select a reasonable purpose, they are choosing an approach that, by their own lights,
makes the best sense. A judicial judgment on this count is hardly untethered—that would
be a caricature—but it is a judicial judgment nonetheless.</p>
      <p>Many textualists distrust resort to purposes for this very reason. Emphasizing the
increasing substitution of statutes for the common law, they want courts to hew closely to
statutory language.82 They think that judges have paid too little attention to the rise of
statutory lawmaking, and have used common law approaches, including analogical
reasoning, in domains where they do not belong.83 And indeed, the Hart and Sacks
materials might well be understood as a product of an early confrontation between
common law thinking and a system of law that is pervaded by statutory interventions.
Justice Scalia believes that an emphasis on the plain meaning of the text, which is what
after all has been enacted, promotes democratic responsibility and also helps to discipline
the judiciary.84</p>
      <p>If purpose is being characterized in a way that defies the ordinary meaning of the
text, Scalia’s argument has considerable pragmatic force. Indeed, textualism might easily
be defended with reference to active liberty, and in two different ways. First, textualism
promotes democratic government, by encouraging the legislature to make its instructions
clear. Over time, a text-oriented judiciary might well promote better accountability from
81 See Ronald Dworkin, Law’s Empire (1985).
82 See Scalia, supra note.
83 Id.

legislatures. Second, textualism</p>
      <p>disciplines judicial creation of “intentions” and
“purposes” to push statutes in judicially preferred directions.85</p>
      <p>To be sure, it is easy to overstate the constraints imposed by text. Where the text
is ambiguous, or leaves gaps, textualism by hypothesis is inadequate, and some other
interpretive tool must be invoked.86 There is a serious risks that in hard cases, preferences
are likely to matter for textualists as for everyone all else.87 My only suggestion is that
Breyer pays too little attention to the risk that any judgments about “reasonableness” will
be the judges’ own, in a way that disserves democracy itself.</p>
      <p>Breyer is correct to say that any theory of interpretation has to be defended in
terms of its consequences. But for interpreting statutes, it is not at all clear that a
purposebased approach, focusing on consequences in particular cases, is preferable to a
textbased approach, one that asks judges not to think little or not at all about consequences. A
textual approach might be simpler to apply; if so, that is surely a point in its favor. And if
judges cannot reliably identify reasonable purposes, textualism might also lead to better
results, or consequences, all things considered.88</p>
      <p>None of this means that Scalia’s approach is necessarily superior to Breyer’s. But
it does point out the necessity of engaging the possibility that on his own consequentialist
grounds, and with an eye firmly on democratic goals, textualism in the interpretation of
85 Note in this regard the very different reaction of German and Italian judges to the emergence of
fascism. German judges proceeded in a purposive fashion, abandoning text in favor of legislative goals
(and consequences!) – in a way that promoted injustice an even atrocity. See Ingo Muller, Hitler’s Justice:
The Courts of the Third Reich(1991). By contrast, the Italian judges made close attention to text and to
plain meaning, in a way that produced much better consequences. See Guido Calabresi, Two Functions of
Formalism, 67 U Chi L Rev 479 (2000), and in particular this suggestion: “To the scholars opposing
Fascism, the nineteenth-century self-contained formalistic system became a great weapon. . . . What it
conserved was the liberal, nineteenth century political approach . . . [and] in a time of Fascism, the
important thing was that it conserved basic democratic attitudes.” Id. at 482.</p>
      <p>86 Consider, for example, the rule of lenity, invoked in Smith v. US, 508 US 223 (1999) (Scalia, J,
dissenting).</p>

the Law; Cass R. Sunstein and Thomas Miles, Do Judges Make Regulatory Policy? An Empirical
Investigation of Chevron, U Chi L Rev.</p>
      <p>88 Some people appear to believe that interpretation, to count as such, necessarily calls for attention to
the “intent” of those who wrote the text in question. See, e.g., Stanley Fish [citation to be added]. This is a
blunder. In law, it is certainly possible to interpret texts by pointing to the ordinary meaning of the words,
without speculating about authorial intentions. Whether this is desirable as well as possible is another
question, one that must be resolved by reference, among other things, to consequences.
ordinary statutes might be better than an approach that explores purposes.89 Of course
textualism is sometimes a fake, as when the text does not have any clear meaning. In my
view, hard cases, in which the text is indeterminate, are best resolved with clear reference
to the views of any applicable administrative agency, and also with close attention to
pertinent canons of construction—which, properly used, discipline the exercise of judicial
discretion and also serve the system of separated powers.90 But this is not the place to
defend that view. The only point is that Breyer has not shown that a purposive approach
to statutory interpretation is unambiguously preferable to the reasonable alternatives.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-11">
      <title>C. Active Liberty As an Interpretive Tool</title>
      <p>Breyer is right to say that the framers wanted to recognize both active liberty and
negative liberty. But the framers saw themselves as republicans, not as democrats,91 and
they did not believe in participatory democracy or in rule through town meetings. On this
count, Breyer slides quickly over intense debates about what the American framers
actually sought to do.92 Of course they attempted to provide a framework for a form of
self-government.93 But so stated, that goal operates at an exceedingly high level of
abstraction, one that cannot easily be brought to bear on concrete cases. Much of the
time, it is hard to link the general idea of self-government to particular judgments about
contemporary disputes in constitutional law.</p>
      <p>Certainly Breyer does not try to argue, in originalist fashion, that the actual
drafters and ratifiers of the Constitution wanted to allow campaign finance reform,
restrictions on commercial advertising, affirmative action programs, and federal
commandeering of state government. He argues instead that the idea of active liberty,
which animates the Constitution, helps to justify these judgments. This is reasonable
enough. But exactly what kind of argument is it? The framers of the Constitution also
placed a high premium on “domestic tranquility,” to which the preamble explicitly refers.
Would it be right to say that because domestic tranquility is a central goal of the
document, the President is permitted to ban dangerous speech—or that because, or if,
affirmative action threatens to divide the races, in a way that compromises “tranquility,”
color-blindness is the right principle after all?</p>
      <p>In any case Breyer rightly emphasizes that the Constitution attempts to protect
negative liberty too. Why shouldn’t a ban on campaign finance restrictions be seen to run
afoul of that goal? Nor is negative liberty the only value at stake. Such restrictions forbid
people from spending their money on political campaigns, in a way that might well be
taken to compromise participatory self-government. In this light we might well see
campaign finance restrictions as offending, at once, both negative and active liberty.
Deductive logic cannot take us from an acknowledgement of the importance of active
liberty to acceptance of campaign finance restrictions; there are no syllogisms here.
Instead an evaluative judgment must be made, to the effect that properly characterized,
the first amendment and its goal of self-government do not condemn (the relevant)
restriction on campaign contributions and expenditures. I believe that this conclusion is
broadly correct, especially when we consider the general need for courts to defer to
congressional judgments in hard cases.94 But the evaluative judgment is inescapable.</p>
      <p>Or suppose that we accept, as we should, Breyer’s claims about the centrality of
active liberty to the constitutional design. Is originalism therefore off the table? Not at all.
We might believe, with some constitutional theorists (including Alexander Hamilton95),
that constitutional provisions, as products of an engaged citizenry, reflect the will of We
the People, as ordinary legislation usually does not. If so, an emphasis on the original
understanding can be taken to serve active liberty at the same time that it promotes
negative liberty. It serves active liberty because it follows the specific judgments of an
engaged citizenry. It promotes negative liberty because and precisely to the extent that
those judgments favor negative liberty (or for that matter active liberty). I do not mean to
suggest that this argument is convincing. The framers and ratifiers included only a small
94 An obvious qualification involves incumbent protection measures. If campaign finance legislation is
operating to insulate incumbents against electoral challenge, there is a strong reason, on grounds of active
liberty (among others), for courts to take a strong role.</p>

segment of early America, and in any case the fact that the framers and ratifiers are long
dead creates serious problems for those who argue for originalism in democracy’s name.
The only point is that Breyer’s emphasis on active liberty does not rule originalism out of
bounds.</p>
      <p>Or return to Thayer’s claim that the Court should strike down legislation only if it
clearly and unambiguously violates the Constitution. Despite his general enthusiasm for
restraint, Breyer does not mean to follow Thayer. But why not? Thayer and his followers
can claim to favor active liberty, because they allow the sovereign people to do as they
choose. Indeed, Learned Hand, an apostle of judicial restraint, wanted courts to be
reluctant to invalidate legislation in large part because he was committed democratic
selfrule.96 Perhaps Breyer thinks that this approach undervalues both negative and active
liberty. But why? Perhaps a deferential Court will ultimately produce exactly the right
mix between the two kinds of freedom. Of course Ely’s approach, emphasizing
reinforcement of democratic processes, can easily be rooted in active liberty; indeed,
active liberty lies at its heart. Breyer writes approvingly of the Warren Court on the
ground that its decisions promoted active liberty (p. 11); and Ely is the Warren Court’s
most systematic defender. Does Breyer mean to endorse Ely? If not, where does he
differ? A puzzling gap in Breyer’s book is the omission of any treatment of Ely’s
apparently similar argument.97</p>
      <p>Recall that Breyer candidly acknowledges that legislative “purpose” is not
something that can simply be found. “Purpose” is what judges attribute to the legislature,
based on their own conception of what reasonable legislators would mean to do. If this is
true for the purposes of individual statutes, it is also true for the purposes of the
Constitution as well. When Breyer says that the “basic” purpose of the Constitution is to
protect active liberty, so as to produce concrete conclusions on disputed questions, his
own judgments about the goals of a reasonable constitution-maker are playing a central
role. Fortunately, Breyer’s own judgments are indeed reasonable. But he underplays the
extent to which they are his own.</p>
      <p>96 See Learned Hand, The Spirit of Liberty (Irving Dillard ed. 1960)/
97 There is only one reference to Ely, presaged by “cf” see p. 1146. Note also that Frank Michelman
has made closely related arguments. See Frank Michelman, Traces of Self-Government, 100 Harv L Rev. 4
(1986).</p>
      <p>The same point bears on Breyer’s enthusiasm for an inquiry into consequences.
Consequences certainly do matter, but much of the time, it is impossible to assess
consequences without reference to disputed questions of value. Return to the question of
affirmative action, and suppose, rightly, that the text of the Constitution could, but need
not, be understood to require color-blindness. If we care about consequences, will we
accept the color-blindness principle or not? Suppose we believe that affirmative action
programs create racial divisiveness and increase the risk that underqualified people will
placed in important positions. If those are bad consequences, perhaps we will oppose
affirmative action programs. An emphasis on consequences as such is only a start. Of
course Breyer is not concerned with consequences alone; he wants to understand them
with close reference to specified purposes, above all “active liberty.” But as I have
suggested, that idea, taken in the abstract, is compatible with a range of different
approaches to constitutional law; it need not be taken to compel Breyer’s own approach.</p>
      <p>None of this means that Breyer is wrong. On the contrary, I believe that he is
largely right. He is right to say that the free speech principle should be understood to
democratic terms. He is right to say that where the Court lacks important information, it
should rule cautiously and narrowly. He is right to resist the constitutional assault on
affirmative action programs (an assault that, by the way, is extremely hard to defend in
originalist terms98). He is right to reject originalism. Above all, he is right to emphasize
the importance of democratic goals to constitutional interpretation.</p>
      <p>But to make his argument convincing, he would have to offer a more sustained
encounter between his own approach and the imaginable alternatives. Essentially for
Breyer’s own reasons, originalism does seem unacceptable, certainly if it is
unaccompanied by respect for precedent; and it is not clear if originalism, so
accompanied, can be made coherent. Bipartisan restraint, of the sort championed by
Thayer and Holmes, has many attractions, and the Court should probably move toward it
in some areas99; but in too many contexts, it too would destabilize our rights and our
institutions. For the evaluation of a democracy-centered approach to constitutional law, a
great deal depends on whether courts will often wield democratic ideals as a sword
98 See Eric Schnapper, Affirmative Action and the Legislative History of the Fourteenth Amendment,
71 Va L Rev. 753 (1985).</p>
      <p>99 See Vermeule, supra note.
against our actual democracy (as Ely urged), or whether they will more frequently use
those ideals as a shield against constitutional attacks (as Breyer appears to urge). A great
deal also depends on our degree of trust in those who wield those ideals, and their likely
reasonableness.</p>
      <p>A deeper point lies in the background here. For the selection of a general theory
of interpretation, a great deal turns on context. I have argued against originalism, but it is
possible to imagine a world in which originalism would make a great deal of sense.
Suppose, for example, that the original public meaning of the founding document would
generally or always produce sensible results; that violations of the original public
meaning would be unjust or otherwise unacceptable; that democratic processes that did
not violate the original public meaning would not cause serious problems from the
standpoint of justice or otherwise; and that judges, not following the original public
meaning, would produce terrible blunders from the appropriate point of view. In such a
world, originalism would be the best approach to follow. I have argued against bipartisan
restraint. But in a world in which democratic processes were systematically reliable, and
in which unrestrained judges would use ambiguous provisions of the Constitution to
impose unjust or otherwise unsupportable policies, the argument for bipartisan restraint
would be very strong. The larger point is that the Constitution itself does not contain a
theory of interpretation, and no single theory would make sense in every imaginable
world.</p>
      <p>It is also possible to doubt whether the Supreme Court should accept any
ambitious or unitary theory of interpretation.100 Perhaps the Court does best, in our actual
world, if it avoids ambitious accounts, and decides cases, if it can, with reference to
reasons that can command agreement from those with diverse views about foundational
questions, and from those who do not want to take a stand on those questions. Perhaps a
commitment to “active liberty” is too sectarian to command general assent. But at least
this much can be said on Breyer’s behalf: If an ambitious account is desirable,
indispensable, or unavoidable, an emphasis on the commitment to democratic rule is
hardly the worst place to start.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-12">
      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Within the Supreme Court itself, the most powerful recent theoretical arguments
have come from Justice Scalia, with his insistence on originalism and his complaint that
if courts are not bound by the original understanding, they are essentially doing whatever
they want.101 Breyer has now developed a distinctive argument of his own, one that
demonstrates the possibility of a nonoriginalist method that, while not eliminating
discretion, is hardly a blank check to the judiciary. Breyer’s originality lies in the effort to
forge links among its three distinctive moving parts: an appreciation of “active liberty”
and its place in our constitutional tradition; a commitment to purposive understandings of
interpretation; and an insistence, inspired by American pragmatism, that theories of
interpretation must be evaluated in terms of their consequences.</p>
      <p>I have emphasized what seems to me a central problem in Breyer’s account: the
difficulty of characterizing purposes, and of counting purposes as “reasonable,” without a
judgment of the interpreter’s own. In hard cases, judgments about purpose are evaluative,
not descriptive.102 What is true for particular provisions is true for the founding document
as a whole. Active liberty is certainly a theme of the document, but it is not easy to
deduce, from that theme, particular conclusions about the legal issues raised campaign
finance restrictions, affirmative action plans, privacy, and judicial review of agency
action. Nor does active liberty, standing alone, make the choice between textual and
purposive approaches to constitutional interpretation. On purely pragmatic grounds,
purposive approaches run into serious problems once we acknowledge the role of judicial
discretion in the characterization of purposes.103</p>
      <p>I have also suggested the possibility of endorsing a kind of second-order
pragmatism, one that attempts to develop tools to discipline the judicial inquiry into both
consequences and purposes. Perhaps we are all pragmatists now, in the sense that we can
agree that any theory of interpretation must pay close attention to the outcomes that it
101 See Scalia, supra note.</p>
      <p>102 This point is emphasized and not deplored in Dworkin, Law’s Empire, supra note; Insofar as he
emphasizes the constructive element in interpretation, Dworkin seems to me to make a large advance on
Hart and Sacks, whose approach resembles his.</p>
      <p>103 Cf. Vermeule, supra note.
produces.104 Whether or not we do agree on that point, we certainly should. The problem
is that many diverse views can march under the pragmatic banner.</p>
      <p>But if Breyer’s particular conclusions are not compelled by his general themes,
they are always plausible, and usually more than that. Many originalists fear that without
originalism, judges will be unloosed, producing a system of interpretation that endangers
self-government and is extremely hard to defend in terms of its consequences. One of the
many virtues of Breyer’s book is its demonstration that these objections are overstated—
that without mechanical jurisprudence or rule-  
104 Note that even Dworkin describes himself as a consequentialist. See Ronald Dworkin, Order of the
Coif Lecture: In Praise of Theory, 29 Ariz. St. L. J. 353, 364 (1997).
