      <p>CONCLUSION .......................................................................... 190</p>
      <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
      <p>In late 1995, Montana became the first and only state to eliminate a
numerical daytime speed limit on its interstate highways. Instead, the state
adopted a "Basic Rule" of "reasonable and prudent" daytime driving. The
law produced a heated debate about its consequences, the relationship
between norms and law, and the choice between rules and standards in statutes

affecting primary conduct. Montana's endeavor to regulate drivers' conduct
without a numerical speed limit offers an intriguing opportunity to explore
the role of social norms in regulating behavior, the importance and feasibility
of cooperation, and the possibility of controlling behavior through relatively
open-ended law.</p>
      <p>In this essay, we investigate the consequences of Montana's daytime
driving rules. We examine the law itself, its effects on driving behavior and
law enforcement, and recent attempts to overturn the law. Specifically, we
evaluate the law's impact on the motoring public and Montana as a whole.
We also consider the Basic Rule's effect on legal standards: Does the law's
subjective nature promote arbitrary and ineffective enforcement? We
explore the effect of the law on so-called "rule of law" values of both drivers
and police officers. In late 1998, the Montana Supreme Court invalidated
the Basic Rule on due process grounds, and the ultimate fate of the
"reasonable and prudent" rule remains unclear. In Part VI, we offer a brief
discussion of that issue.</p>
      <p>Our basic findings are as follows:
1. In the short term, the change in the speed limit had few consequences
for the driving behavior of Montana citizens, in terms of overall speed and
safety. Most citizens appeared to coordinate their behavior around a certain
area of appropriate speed, both during the period of an official 55
mile-perhour (mph) limit and after the return of the Basic Rule. This point suggests
the possibility that driving habits may outstrip the law. Indeed, we suspect
that much of driving behavior is governed by informal norms. Those norms
govern speed as well as many other topics, and have a far greater degree of
flexibility and specificity than any law. Of course these norms operate
against a backdrop set by speed limits in other states and past limits in
Montana. It is hard to know how fast Montanans would drive without this
backdrop.</p>
      <p>2. The change in the speed limit had the significant consequence of
encouraging very fast and somewhat reckless driving by tourists. Many of
these drivers appeared to be attracted to Montana by virtue of its Basic Rule.
This point also has an important implication; a state that allows very fast
driving (because of a high speed limit in the form of a rule or standard) may
find itself becoming a "speed magnet," which may produce unanticipated
dangers.</p>
      <p>3. Partly as a result of (2), aggregate mortality and morbidity rates on the
interstate highways of Montana increased after the switch to the Basic Rule.
Both statistics, however, generally remained within historical fluctuating
ranges, and a sharp upward spike in 1997 does not offer any unambiguous
lesson.</p>
      <p>4. Even taking (2) and (3) into account, the aggregate motor vehicle
accident rate did not increase enormously in Montana, perhaps because the Basic
Rule encouraged drivers to use the interstate highways, which are relatively
safe. This point suggests a final important implication; one of the
consequences of decreasing safety on interstate highways may be to increase
overall safety, if the decrease is a result of a change in policy that shifts drivers
away from relatively more perilous rural roads and makes interstate driving
more attractive.</p>
      <p>5. The Basic Rule has created serious problems for law enforcement. Its
vague nature subjects the Basic Rule to many different interpretations by
both drivers and law enforcement officials. The results have included
increased roadside confrontations between officers and motorists, and also a
judicial and administrative backlog in adjudicating possible violations.</p>
      <p>6. There is some evidence that motorists are becoming accustomed to the
law. For example, traffic citations for Basic Rule violations, initially soaring
in the law's first year, declined as drivers apparently adapted to the flexible
standards. Similarly, after a sharp spike in fatalities in 1997, Montana's
roadways became safer in 1998, the law's third year of operation.</p>
      <p>In the end, we do not mean to say that the Basic Rule is a good or a bad
idea. The most important and interesting elements of this story lie in the
details rather than the "bottom line."</p>

      <p>MONTANA AND THE BASIC RULE</p>
      <sec id="sec-5-1">
        <title>A. Some Relevant Facts</title>
        <p>To understand the Basic Rule, it is necessary to emphasize that Montana is
a large and thinly populated area. With 147,047 square miles of territory, it
stands as the fourth largest state.' Montana's population, however, totals
approximately 870,000, making it the third most sparsely populated state 2
with an average of just six people per square mile. 3 Billings, with its 87,000
residents, is the state's largest city. 4 Yet Billings does not face the suburban
sprawl of other metropolitan areas; the first traffic light outside of the city is
145 miles away in Miles City, population 8,400. 5</p>
        <p>Traveling Montana's vast expanse via its interstate highways can be
relatively hazardous. The state has 88,000 miles of highway. 6 There is no
separate state police force and only 212 Highway Patrol officers monitor the</p>

roads. 7 As of 1995, Montana's rate of 2.3 fatalities per 100 million vehicle
miles was considerably above the national average of 1.8 deaths per 100
million vehicle miles. 8 Moreover, the deadliest stretch of road in the country
and two of the nation's three most perilous highway areas are located in
Montana, with fatality rates of 6.206 and 4.031 per 100 million miles,
respectively. 9 In sum, Montana's wide open spaces afford ample distance and
danger for the motoring public.</p>
        <sec id="sec-5-1-1">
          <title>B. The Fall and Rise of the Basic Rule</title>
          <p>Before the enactment of federally mandated speed limits, Montana
governed its highways under its Basic Rule.' 0 This law, passed in 1955,"1
accorded motorists substantial freedom in conducting themselves on the road,
requiring drivers to operate their vehicles in a
careful and prudent manner and at a rate of speed no greater than is
reasonable and proper under the conditions existing at the point of
operation, taking into account the amount and character of traffic,
condition of brakes, weight of vehicle, grade and width of highway,
condition of surface, and freedom of obstruction to the view ahead.12
Citizens of Montana regarded the Basic Rule as practical and a necessary
way of life, viewing fast driving in the words of one inhabitant, as a
"Godgiven right."' 3</p>
          <p>Congress altered the situation in 1974. In the wake of the 1973 Arab oil
embargo, the federal government enacted the Federal Aid Highways
Amendments of 1974 and imposed a "National Maximum Speed Limit" of
55 mph. 14 Initially urged as a conservation effort, the law rapidly gained

support as a safety measure, reducing highway fatalities.15 The federal
government enforced the mandate by restricting highway funds for those states
that refused to establish the new limit.' 6 As a result, every state acquiesced
and 55 mph emerged as the national speed limit.17</p>
          <p>Its libertarian populace' 8 not content to bow to Washington's edict,
Montana passed a "[fluel conservation speed limit" to achieve nominal
compliance with the federal government's ultimatum.' 9 The law, explicitly
designed to "insure conservation of a resource," 20 established violations of the
speed limit as misdemeanors not reported against a driver's insurance
record. 21 Infractions cost the driver $5, payable directly to the Highway Patrol
officer issuing the ticket. 22 Simultaneously, Montana's legislature enacted
another law stating that its fuel conservation speed limit would remain
effective "only as long as the establishment of those speed limits by the state is
required by federal law as a condition to the state's continuing eligibility to
receive [federal highway] funds ... "23</p>
          <p>Montana's motorists virtually ignored the newly imposed speed limits;
driving behavior was largely a function of norms, not of law. 24 Partly

Rule continued to remain in effect even during the period when the fuel conservation speed
limit applied. For example, if a driver was stopped for driving 120 mph on a road on
which the 55 mph fuel conservation speed limit applied, he would be issued a Basic Rule

were not "reasonable and prudent." Telephone Interview with Bert Obert, Major,

cause they were accustomed to driving under the Basic Rule and partly
because of the weak sanctions for speeding, the state's citizens continued their
basic driving patterns in the decades following 1974. As one newspaper
described the situation, "Montana drivers are known for flouting the law, and
the state for winking at such behavior. 25 Studies reported that a majority of
motorists disobeyed Montana's speed limit on both interstates and two-lane
highways. 26 Critics derided the national speed limit as "irrelevant,"
"practically meaningless," and "a joke." 27 Moreover, some disobeyed the
speed limit on principle, as a protest against federal intrusion. 28 Thus, the
very existence of the law created at least a degree of faster driving. 29
Folklore emerged regarding the laxity of enforcement. 30 The state traffic
highway spokesman recognized the dilemma, acknowledging, "'You cannot
choose the speed limit for people, . . [t]he truth is that it can't be enforced
unless people agree with it.'"31</p>
          <p>The lax compliance took a toll on law enforcement. Despite writing
approximately 66,000 $5 tickets per year, the Highway Patrol described the
law as "'a nondeterrent to speeding.'" 32 The law also had a corrosive effect

Dec. 10, 1995 ("[H]alf of all drivers exceeded the 65 mph limit on Montana's interstates.
Two-thirds ignored the 55 mph signs on two lane highways."). One resident summarized
the widespread violations, noting, "[niobody drove the speed limit anyway." Jim

          <p>29 The social meaning of fast driving became, in the aftermath of the federal speed limit
law, a kind of rebellion against federal intrusion, and in some quarters the result was to
spur faster driving. See, e.g., Lawrence Lessig, The Regulation of Social Meaning, 62 U.
CHI. L. REV. 943, 951 (1995) (discussing the role of social meaning in human behavior).</p>
          <p>30 For example, Representative Pat Williams, Montana's only Congressman, recounted
an anecdote where a driver paid a patrolman in cash and the motorist began to close his
window to drive away. The officer stopped the individual and said "'Hold on, old timer,
hold onto that ticket. It's good for the rest of the day.'" Kenworthy, supra note 13, at
A3. In another Montana driving tradition, a driver and each of his passengers would place
"$5 on the dashboard, and if the driver made it from Billings to Helena without getting
stopped, he won the kitty." In Big Sky State, supra note 4, at IA. "'The joke goes that if
you g[ot] pulled over, you'd just give the officer a $20 bill, ... then tell the next three
guys you already paid."' Id.</p>

          <p>32 Kenworthy, supra note 13, at A3 (quoting Col. Craig Reap, head of the Montana
Highway Patrol). Admittedly, the Highway Patrol could have punished offenses such as
reckless driving, usually defined as traveling at more than 85 mph, more harshly and with
on the public's perception of law enforcement. The head of the Highway
Patrol noted that motorists' disregard for speed limits "'caused disrespect for
us [the Highway Patrol] in particular because we were burdened with
enforcing the law.''33 Furthermore, the law demoralized the officers
themselves. One patrolman lamented, "'You wondered how much good you
were doing out there. "'34</p>
          <p>Montana received its reprieve from federal regulation of its interstate
highways with the enactment of the National Highway System Designation
Act (the "NHSDA") in 1995. 35 Spurred by the Republicans' desire to limit
the role of the national government, Congress enacted the NHSDA by the
overwhelming margin of 419 to 7 in the House and on a voice vote in the
Senate, thus repealing the federal speed limit. 36 President Clinton
"reluctantly" signed the legislation on November 28, 1995. 37</p>
          <p>The NHSDA endured a storm of alarmist and often unfounded protests,
many based on predictions about adverse effects on safety. 38 President
Clinton admonished states to "exercise this authority responsibly," 39 while
Transportation Secretary Federico Pefia sent letters to governors, "imploring
them, for safety reasons, to consider not raising speed limits. "40 Insurance
companies warned of premium increases to pay for the impending roadway
higher fines. The Highway Patrol, however, rarely invoked such penalties, writing fewer
than 3,000 reckless driving tickets per year before the Basic Rule. See id.

Montana law enforcement echoed the national fears, predicting a potential
50% increase in fatalities with "phenomenal wrecks ... cars that roll 8, 9,
and 10 times." 43 One trooper ominously warned, "'[m]y phone is going to
ring more often in the middle of the night.'"44</p>
          <p>Proponents of the NHSDA mounted their own public relations effort.
They argued that the law would simply legalize existing behavior by drivers,
and bring the law more in accordance with informal norms already
producing sufficiently safe driving. 45 Supporters downplayed the safety fears,
noting improvements in drunk-driving laws, seat belts, air bags, and anti-lock

          <p>47 See Kenworthy, supra note 13, at A3. The new law, however, provides stiff
penalties. Unlike the conservation speed limit, under the Basic Rule fines can range from $70
to $500 and count against a driver's insurance record. See MONT. CODE ANN. § 61-8-303
(1996).</p>

motorists traveling above 80 mph increased from 2% to 5%,49 total average
speeds increased negligibly, from 72 to 74 mph during the law's first few
months. 50 In fact, speed played no part in the first twelve traffic fatalities. 51
Lynn Conn, a Helena resident, seemed to typify Montanans' attitude toward
the Basic Rule: "'I'm a 65 mph driver, and I imagine I'll just stay there.' 52
The Director of the state's Highway Traffic Safety Division said, "'[a] lot of
press outside the state did not assume Montanans had a modicum of common
sense ....I still give the average Montanan a lot of credit for pretty much
driving in a reasonable and prudent manner. The. world is not going to
hell.' 53 Anecdotal evidence indicates that Montanans' driving behavior
remains relatively constant in terms of speed, although speed limit proponents
warn that motorists, now more accustomed to the increased roadway speeds,
may be driving less carefully. 54</p>
          <p>Three factors may explain the constancy of drivers' behavior. First, it
may take a significant period of time for a change in the speed limit to
produce changes in driving behavior. Second, as Montanans like to insist, the
state's motorists appear to possess good judgment and honed ability in
traversing its highways. 55 This accounts for the striking 72 mph speeds before
the repeal of the law and the nominal initial increase thereafter. Republican
Governor Marc Racicot contended that, "'[w]e tend to respect each other,
instead of aiming for one another. I have great faith that Montanans will be
concerned with safety and security.' '"56 One state resident maintained that
Montanans are "'used to driving long distances, and they know which roads
are safe at which speed.' 57</p>
          <p>The third and perhaps the most compelling explanation of drivers'
constant speeds may be Montana's often treacherous road conditions. These
conditions, more than formal law, may dictate much driving behavior.
Interstate drivers in Montana face a litany of perils: brutal weather, icy pavement,

challenging road conditions, one resident stated, "'[i]f you don't drive in a
reasonable and prudent manner, you end up in the ditch."' 59 A visiting reporter
said that in Montana, "'[t]he real limits are set by the land.'" 6° Thus it
appears that driving behavior in Montana is largely a function of local
knowledge; it is partly for this reason that the change in law was far less important
to behavior than it was feared to be. Before the abandonment of the national
speed limit, citizens of Montana were violating it regularly, and when the
abandonment occurred, those citizens continued to do what they were doing.

Rule violations] show a real lack of respect, not only for the law in Montana,
but for the rights and safety of Montana drivers and tourists .... Even if
these were professional drivers, not everyone else on the road was." '' 70
Highway Patrol officials were equally livid. One officer questioned a
motorist who was stopped for driving 107 mph over a bridge deck, asking,
"'What would happen to you in your home state?"' 71 When the man
responded that at home he would have been charged with reckless driving, the
officer questioned, "'Well, what makes you think it's all right to do that in
this state?" 72</p>
          <p>The influx of tourists altered both average speeds and highway fatalities.
But before analyzing these statistics, it is important to note their limitations.
Most importantly, the Highway Patrol's statistics lack appropriate detail in
determining the full impact of Basic Rule driving patterns. For example, the
statistics do not reveal how many of the out-of-staters' accidents occurred at
times when the Basic Rule was not the governing law and a numerical speed
limit was in effect. 73 Nor do the reports specify what percentage of the
outof-state drivers' accidents involved factors other than speed, including
alcohol or failure to wear seat belts, both significant contributors to highway
fatalities. Lastly, fatality statistics tend to fluctuate considerably each year,
even under conditions when the posted speed limit remained constant, again
undercutting the impact of such annual comparisons. 74

          <p>Within the context of the preceding paragraph's disclaimer, noticeable
driving patterns, especially those involving out-of-state motorists, began to
emerge. 75 Although the average speed increased only 2 miles per hour
during the Basic Rule's first few months, 76 by the close of the law's first year,
average speeds climbed to 78 mph on the. interstate, 77 in significant part (it
appears) because of tourists. 78 Moreover, a Highway Patrol study indicated
that "60 percent of the cars traveling more than 85 mph were from out of
state. The figure was 75 percent for those traveling more than 95 mph."79
Another investigation documented that out-of-staters, particularly Canadians,
drive at higher speeds than residents on Montana's roads. 80</p>
          <p>The Montana Highway Patrol's roadway safety statistics tend to support
the perception of tourists as the more dangerous drivers. From 1996 to
1997, the number of out-of-state vehicles involved in fatal accidents
increased by 38%,81 and the number of roadway deaths involving out-of-state
vehicles increased by 69% during the same one-year span.82 These numbers
should, of course, be put in perspective. For example, non-Montanans were
involved in only 23% of fatal accidents in 199683 and only 26% in
199784that out-of-state vehicles were involved in 52 deaths between January 1, 1997 and August

          <title>C. A Note on Coordination</title>
          <p>The varying driving habits of Montanans and out-of-staters indicate a
general coordination problem under the law; each motorist may interpret the
Basic Rule differently, thereby causing significant divergences in traffic flow.
Such speed disparities can be perilous, potentially increasing the "risk of
crashes and other hazardous traffic situations, such as unsafe lane changes
and following too closely."86 A Highway Patrol study estimated that the
number of people traveling with the general traffic flow decreased to a
record low of 41 %.87 This is important because accidents may be a function of
flow rather than mere speed. Hence a numerical speed limit has an
advantage to the extent that it provides a number around which drivers may
coordinate their behavior. The significant increase in fatalities in 1997 may have
resulted partly from this lack of coordination.</p>

          <p>Statistics from this first year appeared to suggest that proponents of the
Basic Rule were correct on some disputed questions. In particular,
supporters contended that increased speeds on highways lured motorists away from
dangerous country roads and onto better-designed, more expedient
highways. 90 Consequently, although interstate deaths increased, the Basic Rule
promoted safety by decreasing total deaths on all roads. 9' The first year
under the Basic Rule seemed to fulfill the promise of efficient, self-regulating,
and most surprisingly, safer, travel on Montana's roads.</p>

presumably virulent element of speed proved less troublesome in 1998. Again

          <p>This data is even less conclusive than the vacillating numbers indicate.
For example, when comparing 1996 to 1997, excepting those accidents
where a numerical speed limit was in effect (i.e., non-Basic Rule times or
zones), the increases in fatal accidents and total roadway deaths amounted to
15 %99 and 28 %,100 respectively-higher numbers from the previous year, but
not as devastating as the original figures. Deleting those accidents where
alcohol was a factor further ameliorates the situation. Calculating fatal
accidents and total deaths without those incidents where alcohol was a factor, the
numbers rise a modest 13%1o and 19%,102 respectively. Even the specter of
unbridled Basic Rule speed, seemingly a leading factor in roadway deaths,
may be less important than it seems in light of the complexity in tracing
causation. The Highway Patrol suggested, "'[i]t's really difficult to pin down
one factor and say this is the primary cause ... [or] factor that resulted in
this crash and perhaps this death."10 3 In short, driving safety under the Basic
Rule fluctuates, producing relatively less hazardous motoring in 1996 and
year-to-date 1998, while exacerbating roadway fatalities in 1997. Equally
important, the Basic Rule stands as only one factor in roadway safety
analysis; conditions such as alcohol and unsafe driving during times or in zones
with numerical speed limits also were significant elements in this
multifaceted problem. Of course it is possible that some of these conditions are
connected with the Basic Rule. Dangerous driving while drunk may be
aggravated in the absence of a numerical speed limit, and reckless driving in
zones without such limits may have a "spillover" effect on zones with
numerical limits.</p>

        <p>There is also reason to question the meaning of the fatality figures
themselves, because such data varies enormously from year to year. For
example, from 1987 to 1988 Montana roadway deaths decreased by 15%, while

        <p>Measured in historical context, the 34% increase in roadway fatalities in
1997 appears to be a statistical anomaly within this fluctuating /range, while
the aggregate of almost three years under the Basic Rule is not greatly out of
line with historic patterns of overall roadway death variations. 106 Some state
lawmakers have so urged, with one asserting, "'[a]s far as I can see, the
statistics aren't there to warrant' [a numerical speed limit]. . . . One year's
worth of statistics are not enough to make a determination." 10 7 The Director
of Montana's Highway Traffic Safety Division captured the essence of the
fatality-rate debate, noting, "[i]f you're looking for a compelling reason to
have a maximum speed limit, you won't find it in the data." 0 8</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the Basic Rule has done little to alter Montanans' driving
behavior. Tourists, however, relish the lack of numerical limits, potentially
contributing to divergent traffic flows and increased overall speeds. Overall,
the nascent fatality figures, representing a decrease in deaths in 1996, a
substantial increase in 1997, and a subsequent decline in 1998 year-to-date

inconclusive verdict on Basic Rule safety.</p>
        <p>III. TRADEOFFS</p>
        <p>The Basic Rule carries with it both advantages and disadvantages.
Although we cannot undertake a full cost-benefit analysis here, we can cast
light on some of the important variables. Part of the analysis involves a
form of "risk-risk tradeoffs,"109 which occur when the regulation of one risk
affects another risk. Just as regulation of one source of environmental
danger (such as nuclear power plants) may increase the danger from another
source (such as coal-fired power plants), so too for speed limits. Increasing
or decreasing speed limits may increase some risks while decreasing others.
For example, a higher speed limit on an interstate highway may increase
deaths on the interstates while reducing the use of, and deaths on, less
traveled, more dangerous roads. Hence, an increased speed limit may save
aggregate lives. This section seeks to identify and analyze some of the most
important tradeoffs.</p>

than conclusive, it seems fair to characterize Montana's roads as somewhat
more dangerous under the Basic Rule. Increased speeds, reckless tourists
and traffic flow disparities appear particularly hazardous under the new law.
Admittedly, the evidence is ambiguous, for it is possible to claim that many
of the accidents and deaths occur at times or in zones not governed under the
Basic Rule, that such numbers tend to fluctuate from year to year, and that
increased seatbelt usage and decreased use of alcohol could have
dramatically increased safety. These claims undercut the most alarmist reading of
the data. More evidence is necessary for a final judgment; currently, it
appears that the Basic Law has decreased safety by a modest but non-trivial
amount. On the whole, safety, while the most significant concern, cannot
yet be shown to be more than a slight detriment overall.</p>

          <title>B. Fuel Efficiency</title>
          <p>Decreased fuel efficiency represents another adverse consequence of the
Basic Rule' As vehicle speed increases, fuel efficiency decreases, thereby
causing motorists to spend more on gasoline and consume more than
necessary of a non-replenishing natural resource. The Popular Mechanics
re109 See W. Kip Viscusi, Risk-Risk Analysis, in THE MORTALITY COSTS OF REGULATORY
EXPENDITURES: A SPECIAL ISSUE OF THE JOURNAL OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY 5 (W. Kip
Viscusi ed., 1994) (suggesting risk-risk analysis as a replacement for cost-benefit
analysis).
porter who test drove the Montana minivan throughout the state provides a
colorful discussion of the decrease in fuel efficiency at high speeds, writing,
"[b]ack at 113 mph, the trip computer on the Trans Sport [Montana minivan]
says we're averaging 6 miles per gallon. Right there, we discover the first
drawback of traveling-even legally-at such high speeds. At this rate, the
Trans Sport's 24-gal. tank will be dusty by Tarkio, about 125 miles down the
road."1 10 Conversely, a commercial truck driver noted the economic
advantage of lower speeds, stating that on his trip through Montana from
Vancouver, British Columbia, to Hartford, Connecticut, "'[i]t's about a thousand
bucks in my pocket to drive slower."' 1 I</p>
          <p>Reasonable questions, however, can be raised about the fuel efficiency
argument. Obviously, fuel efficiency alone is not the criterion upon which to
establish speed limits; if it were, the law would limit vehicles to their most
efficient and unrealistically low speeds of 35 to 40 mph. 112 It is also possible
to increase fuel efficiency while maintaining a relatively high speed limit
through, for example, higher miles per gallon or using light rather than
heavy trucks. 1 3 Even accounting for such rebuttals, however, decreased
fuel efficiency looms as another Basic Rule disadvantage.</p>

        <title>C. Air Pollution</title>
        <p>Increased air pollution is another adverse effect of the Basic Rule.
Preliminary data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suggests that
"rural states such as Montana, which have sharply raised their speed limits
[although the increase in actual speed itself is slight], face a higher increase
110Oldham, supra note 69, at 46. The reporter also admitted that at the vehicle's top
in ozone-forming Nox [oxides of nitrogen] emissions." 114 The EPA survey
estimated that Montana faced a 12.74% increase in ozone forming
emissions.115 On the other hand, Montana already meets the national primary and
secondary standards for ozone, and hence the increase in air pollution from
automobiles does not appear to create serious risks of any kind. An official
from the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, Jim Carlin, found a
negligible impact on the environment of motorists' higher speeds."16 While
Mr. Carlin noted elevated levels of carbon monoxide around Billings and
Missoula were probably attributable to increased speeds, he characterized the
practical effect of such speed-related increases in air pollution as "hardly
even quantifiable; they [the higher levels of emissions] wouldn't be a good
reason to debate the speed limit law."" 7T This appears to be a plausible
view, though the increased pollution certainly counts as an adverse effect.</p>
        <sec id="sec-5-3-1">
          <title>D. Tourism</title>
          <p>The fact that Montana operates as a "speed magnet" is not only a
negative; perhaps the Basic Rule actually helps generate more tourism, thereby
creating various positive welfare effects. This is certainly a reasonable
judgment. Nevertheless, there is a debate about whether the "reasonable and
prudent" standard might decrease tourism, another potential drawback." 8
Initially, as with many other aspects of the new law, Basic Rule opponents
made alarmist predictions, forecasting a steep drop in tourism,11 9 Montana's
second largest industry. 20 But these predictions were based on anecdotes,
not evidence. For example, the Highway Patrol reported that "one
out-ofstate woman had called to say she was canceling her vacation for safety
reasons."' 2' A Maine newspaper, after observing only one month under the
Basic Rule, exhorted:</p>
          <p>A lot of people from other states will avoid driving through Montana
now that they know some of the barriers are down against extravagant
speeds on those highways .... Montana is right to be worried about

gorgeous state suddenly looks like a place to visit some other year." 122
In analyzing a potential decrease in tourism, the Billings Gazette polled
travel agents in New York, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New Jersey
to query whether vacationers intended to cancel planned trips to Montana.1 23
None reported any cancellations. 124 Christopher Reynolds, a Los Angeles
Times travel writer, concurred that the spate of publicity would not deter
tourists. 125 The general manager of one of Missoula's newest hotels
asserted, "I think the speed limit [the Basic Rule] will bring people into
Montana." 126 An official from Travel Montana, the state's tourism agency,
confirmed that "there is no indication that the law has either helped or hindered
tourism." 27 In the end, speed limits seem to have no significant effect on
Montana's robust tourism industry. Any decrease from frightened motorists
has probably been matched by those seeking a state without numerical speed
limits.</p>

a state and the beginning of Montana as a test track." 30 A Highway Patrol
officer lamented that the Basic Rule "'[m]ade us the joke of the nation.'"1'3</p>
          <p>Montanans viewed outsiders' criticism as an attack on their state's values
and vehemently defended their libertarian ways. Governor Racicot's
Communication Director bristled, "'[tihe tone of much of the coverage has been
patronizing at best .... And I understand it. Urban Americans can be
uncomfortable if they don't have someone else telling them what to do." 1 32
One resident replying to Kornheiser's arrogant missive did not mince words:
The whole thing shakes down to a simple truth about how we do things
here. Our legislature made a law reflecting reality instead of
prescribing it. We're doing just fine with that, thank you, we're used to being
responsible for ourselves. If you can't come to terms with that, don't
drive here. 133
Despite these impassioned rebuttals, Montana's image emerged a bit battered
from the national press pounding. On the whole, however, since tourism
remains unaffected and Montanans themselves shrug off outsiders' opinions,
the eccentric reputation may prove a source of pride for the state's

speeds.1 35 There may well be significant productivity gains from time saved.
Highway Patrol Sergeant Robert Koch highlighted the economic importance
of saving time on the roadways, noting, "'[w]e have a lot of people making a
living driving, . . . and they are appreciative of the fact they can drive 70 or
even 80 miles per hour on the interstate."" 136 Residents also favor the
increased speeds to facilitate weekly errands or enhance social life. 137 The
increased speeds can result in substantial time savings. "A car going 65 mph
takes more than 10 hours to cross Montana. Go 80 mph, and you shave off
two hours." 138 Overall, a U.S. News &amp; World Report article aptly
summarized the productivity argument, stating, "[fluel efficiency has doubled since
1974, and saving a few bucks on a long trip by doing 65 vs. 75 is hardly
compelling. But many drivers will find savings of an hour or two in travel
time quite appealing." 1 39 It would be highly desirable to quantify the various
savings from these efforts, though we have not been able to do so here.</p>

advantage under the Basic Rule. Proponents contend that prior to the law, the
majority of motorists did not obey the posted speed limits.1 40 Consequently,
advocates argue, drivers who adhered to the mandated levels were actually
dangerous, disrupting the traffic flow by traveling significantly slower than
most other vehicles on the road.141 Furthermore, proponents claim that the

          <p>149 Ironically, one of the Highway Patrol's initial arguments against the Basic Rule was
a predicted decrease in speeding infractions. See id. at 9. Law enforcement contended
that such traffic stops enabled officers to detain suspicious drivers, often resulting in the
motorists' arrests for other, more serious crimes. See id. ("Mr. Wakefield [a Montana
Highway Patrol officer] added that speed offenses used to allow the police to pull over
shifty-looking motorists. He once apprehended a gang of armed robbers that way."). The
argument implied that under the Basic Rule, officers would have fewer opportunities to
stop motorists for speeding, thereby depriving police of the opportunities to discover and
arrest dangerous offenders. See id. Despite the dubious constitutionality of such a tactic,
the predictions now seem inapposite: the Highway Patrol actually issues more citations,

Second, the Basic Rule's mutable standards encourage motorists to challenge
citations in court, resulting in more numerous and protracted trials. 163
Consequently, law enforcement and Montana's legal system must endure a
deluge of Basic Rule cases. The Highway Patrol described the increasing
workload:</p>
          <p>More offenders are taking basic rule violations to court. Thus officers
must prepare for the case and appear in court for these challenges.
Because of the law's subjectivity, trials involving basic rule violations tend
to take more time. Case preparation and court appearance time have
increased by 614 hours over the previous year [1995].164
Montana's Attorney General, Joseph Mazurek, derided the increase in court
time and costs, emphasizing the detriment to public safety by decreasing
officers' time patrolling the highways. 65 Third, the increase in accidents
under the Basic Rule resulted in a further drain on officials' time. Comparing
1995 to 1996, officers spent an additional 4,000 hours in 1996 investigating
crash sites, a 9.6% increase from 1995.166 Fourth, local courts appear
doubly affected, as they deal with both the rising case load as well as recording
the Basic Rule infractions. 67 Finally, uncertainty about the meaning of the
rule means that drivers do not know, in advance, when they will be violating
the law, and hence there is a risk of lack of fair notice-a point we take up
below.</p>

increased revenues, the American Legion's efforts, and the state's advertising

would constitute a change under the Basic Rule. On a more serious note, Colonel Craig

underpopulated area. See Telephone Interview with Craig Reap, Colonel, Montana Highway

In opposition, roadside confrontations, court time, legal costs, crash
investigations and an overburdened judicial system make enforcement more
difficult. Despite the augmented revenues and moral support, it appears that the
demands of apprehending, investigating and prosecuting Basic Rule
violations significantly burdens Montana's thinly-staffed Highway Patrol.168</p>

          <title>B. Administering Standards</title>
          <p>The most difficult challenge under the Basic Rule is establishing workable
criteria for arrest and prosecution. The essential problem is that there is no
quantitative basis for deciding whether a motorist has violated the law.
Variously described as "confusing," 169 "nebulous,"170 "squishy," 17 1
"vaguely defined,"1 72 "arbitrary and inconsistent," 173 and "an enforcement
nightmare," 1 74 administering the Basic Rule is an onerous task because it is
so unclear. Law enforcement officials and motorists find the law too
subjective, hindering both drivers' ability to comply with the Basic Rule and the
Highway Patrol's ability to deter violators. 175 A reporter analogized the
dilemma to asking every law enforcement official "to decide how many drinks
each driver may have, based on body weight and type, before becoming too
drunk to drive."' 76 A survey of what speed would constitute a Basic Rule
violation revealed the considerable disparity in estimates on the subject. 177
168 However, law enforcement's economic and temporal strains appear less a function of
the Basic Rule and more a result of the state's budgetary allocation. See supra Part IV.A.
From the Basic Rule's expanding revenue figures, it seems plausible that the fines could
ameliorate the law's increased costs as well as provide for the hiring of new Highway
Patrol officers, judges or court personnel to meet law enforcement's needs.</p>

          <p>Speeds of more than 100 mph are particularly vexing for law enforcement.
Many officers state the refrain that "'[a]nything in triple digits is probably a
ticket," '" 8 1 defining 100 mph as "the real Montana speed limit." 82 But
others are not as certain that the 100 mph threshold triggers a violation. When
queried whether a motorist legally could drive more than 100 mph, Major
Steve Barry, Deputy Chief of Montana's Highway Patrol, admitted, "'I can't

disinclined to stop a professional driver on a desolate highway at speeds in
excess of 100 mph. 184</p>
          <p>Montana's judiciary also is reluctant to assign a fixed numerical speed
limit. Some judges impose a de facto 85 mph limit, asserting, "'[b]ring that
speed into my court and that person is guilty." 1 85 Other judges disagree,
contending "there's no speed that would necessarily result in a
conviction. . . . 'Ninety-five on the interstate between here [Helena] and Billings

          <p>Frustrated by the lack of established limits, some Highway Patrol officers
and state officials resorted to employing non-numerical guidelines to
encourage Basic Rule compliance. One Highway Patrolman exhorted, "'Don't
drive so fast you can't enjoy the scenery!" ' 8 8 Other officers emphasized
conformity with prevailing traffic patterns, warning, "'People who are
passing everything-that's the type of person we're going to be focusing on." 1 89
Finally, some law enforcement officials appealed to drivers' caution,
imploring individuals to travel "at a speed that would be comfortable with a

          <p>The dearth of consistent standards resulted in arbitrary and ineffective
enforcement. The discretion of scores of officers, prosecutors and judges
combined with the numerous Basic Rule conditions concerning weather,
roads, and vehicle maintenance fosters inconsistency.' 9' Additionally, the
Highway Patrol asserts that the Basic Rule's subjective nature hinders
enforcement by creating longer vehicle stops and increased court
appearances. 92 Consequently, law officers spend less time on the road, 193 and the
roadside stops become more confrontational, detracting from overall safety
and enforcement efficiency. 94</p>
          <p>A recent Park County case involving a motorist traveling at 101 mph
illustrates the debate over establishing workable standards.'95 A district court
jury acquitted the driver of any Basic Rule violations.1 96 The decision
incensed law enforcement officials. 197 Highway Patrol Chief Craig Reap stated
"'[i]f someone hits your car at 101 mph, wouldn't you be outraged to hear
there's no violation?""' 98 The Attorney General was equally indignant,
proclaiming "if being caught driving 101 mph isn't violating the basic rule, ...
[I don't] know what [is]."1 9 The defendant's attorney countered that the
driver's background as a mechanic, the car's exemplary maintenance, and

the deserted road's flat surface made travel at 101 mph perfectly reasonable
and prudent. 2°° The attorney dismissed claims that the law was confusing,
emphasizing the jury's sound judgment in considering the totality of the
driving environment. 20 1</p>
          <p>The Basic Rule has had a detrimental effect on the consistency and
potentially the overall effectiveness of Montana's law enforcement. Admittedly,
the Basic Rule affords ample and possibly excessive discretion. However,
the cause of the "standards" problem emanates not only from the law's
vagueness, but also from patrolmen' and judges' variable interpretations of
the Basic Rule's expressed "reasonable and prudent" standards. Those
officers and judges who establish their own, perhaps idiosyncratic, numerical
limits and uniformly stop or convict defendants under fixed guidelines might
be thought to endanger both the spirit and the letter of the Basic Rule, in turn
creating an uncertain patchwork of rule-free and rule-bound law
enforcement. A more uniform enforcement process might have reduced this
problem. Consequently, the Basic Rule's enforcement problems stem partly from
the vagaries of individual assessments and multiple conditions. These points
lead naturally to the question of whether the Basic Rule compromises values
associated with the rule of law.</p>

          <title>C. Rule of Law Values</title>
          <p>Drivers face numerous opportunities to either comply with or disobey the
rule of law. As discussed previously, Montanans routinely ignored prior
speed limits, causing disrespect for the law and demoralizing the officers
charged with enforcing the state's statutes. 20 2 Furthermore, some officers
speculated that violation of speed limit laws lead to infractions of other
vehicular offenses and a general deterioration of rule of law values. 20 3 Speed
200 Id. The Highway Patrol disagreed with the defense attorney's argument that the
driver's background as a mechanic ameliorated the Basic Rule violation: "[O]ther drivers
cannot possibly be expected to factor another driver's occupation into their decision
making." Montana Highway Patrol Legislative Handout, supra note 86.</p>

          <p>203 "'People develop a habit of not obeying the law' when the speed limit is lower than
most people are driving. . . . 'That bleeds over to stop signs, crosswalks, things that get
people hurt."' Hardy, supra note 112, at 5 (quoting Major Steve Barry, Deputy Chief of
the Montana Highway Patrol). Not all commentators ascribe to Major Barry's theory.
See Steve Thompson, ChangingDriving Habits in a New York Minute, AUTOWEEK, Jan. 8,
1996, at 10 (expressing skepticism that "ignoring unrealistic speed limits equals scofflaws
equals running red lights .... Better cars and higher speeds don't necessarily make people
blow red lights. Driving behavior, like all human behavior, is much more complicated
than that.").
limit opponents heralded the return of the Basic Rule, averring that the new
law would cease turning "law-abiding citizens into scofflaws." 2°4</p>
          <p>Rule of law values also suffer under the Basic Rule. Anecdotal evidence
suggests that the Basic Rule also gives rise to additional traffic violations,
although the infractions differ from those arising under prior speed limits. 20 5
For example, officers report that drivers frequently do not decelerate when
leaving the interstates and entering commercial centers. 2°6 Law enforcement
officials from neighboring states also report externalities. In Idaho, a state
policeman assigned to patrol the Montana-Idaho border regularly stops
drivers exceeding 90 mph. 20 7 The Idaho officer notes that many motorists are
unaware of Idaho's laws or are simply inattentive to their vehicle's speed,
despite three signs denoting the change in state speed limits. 20 8</p>
          <p>As with most effects of the Basic Rule, the law's effects on motorists' rule
of law values appears inconclusive. While evidence suggests that traffic
violations that are not related to speed have decreased, other speed-related
violations are on the rise. 2°9 Likewise, the theory that motorists are no
longer being turned into "scofflaws" is countered by the significant increase
in citations issued under the Basic Rule 210 and by the externalities reported in
border states. 211</p>

with a fine of $25 for driving 10 mph over the posted limit and no points
against the individual's insurance record. 2 13 Motorists driving more than 10
mph over the speed limit would incur additional fines and have the infraction
posted to their insurance record. 2 14</p>
          <p>State Senator Bill Crippen presented the coalition's proposal in a bill
introduced in January 1997.215 The legislation faced an uphill battle from the
outset. Proposed in a "legislature [that] has a long history of turning down
proposals to increase speeding penalties," 216 the bill encountered significant
opposition and was defeated on a procedural vote of 35 to 15.217 Although
Senator Crippen managed to revive the legislation on a 26 to 24 committee
vote to debate the issue before the full Senate, 218 the bill's prospects seemed
bleak.</p>
          <p>Opposing lawmakers asserted that the public did not support altering the
Basic Rule. Polls showed that 56% of Montanans and 58% of legislators
opposed numerical limits. 2 19 As one conservative legislator explained,
"'[p]eople in Montana don't feel it's necessary .... We drive in a prudent
manner. I went door to door during the election, and a good percentage
didn't think government had any business interfering in how fast people want
to drive."' 220 Other speed limit detractors echoed the dearth of public
support, noting that "a number of state groups representing county attorneys,
lower court judges and sheriff and police officers didn't testify at the hearing
because they declined to take a position on SB 64."221 Senator Arnie Mohl
summarized the opposition position best, declaring "'[t]he public don't [sic]
want a speed limit. Let's leave it lay."' 22 2 Opponents ultimately prevailed,

tenth legislator's request on September 4, 1997 triggered a mail canvass of
lawmakers; proponents needed a majority of 76 votes to convene the
legislature. 225 Speed limit proponents again cited mounting highway fatalities as
justification for numerical limits. 226 An impassioned legislator decried,
."'[o]ur friends and neighbors are dying out there.' 227</p>
          <p>Opponents rejected the link between the Basic Rule and fatalities. One
lawmaker observed that "many of the deaths have involved alcohol or the
failure to use seat belts, and that many have occurred at night, when a speed
limit is in effect. "228 Given the legislature's historic dislike of speed limits,
S.B. 64's resounding defeat, and the overall lack of public support, it
appeared unlikely lawmakers would vote to convene the legislature. 229 These
predictions came true as speed limit proponents lost their bid to reconvene
the legislature by a lopsided vote of 110 to 38.230</p>
          <p>The political polarization the speed limit issue engenders is the most
interesting aspect of recent legislative actions. Although polls show that
Montanans are roughly evenly split on the speed limits question, significant
differences of opinion exist by geographic region, gender and age. For example,
residents of Montana's more rural eastern and central regions favor the Basic
Rule to shorten the time required to travel the long distances between the
areas' isolated communities. 231 City residents tend to favor numerical limits. 232

say they've found little or no support for the proposal.").</p>
          <p>232 See Daytime Speed Limit Not Supported, supra note 231.</p>
          <p>233 See Charles S. Johnson, What We Prefer, STANDARD (Lee, Mont.), Jan. 5, 1997, at
Court emphasized that the law enforcement machinery of the state had not
attempted to limit the discretion of police officers through guidelines, and
that it had relied instead on individual, case-by-case judgments. 242 Thus "the
average motorist in Montana would have no idea of the speed at which he or
she could operate his or her motor vehicle .... Furthermore, the basic rule
not only permits, but requires the kind of arbitrary and discriminatory
enforcement that the due process clause in general, and the void-for-vagueness
doctrine in particular, are designed to prevent," largely because it delegates
"basic public policy" to police officers, judges, and juries. 243 A dissenting
opinion by Justice Regnier emphasized that the defendant had been
"[o]perating a vehicle at 85 miles per hour on a two-lane highway with frost
heaves, steep hills, and curves, where farm vehicles may unexpectedly
appear." 244 Thus Justice Regnier's suggestion appeared to be that the
defendant in the case could not reasonably claim to have lacked notice that he was
violating the law. 245</p>
          <p>The purpose of this paper is principally empirical, and thus we do not
venture a detailed discussion of the Court's ruling under the due process
clause. But what we have said here offers some lessons about the need for
empirically-informed constitutional law. It is difficult for a court to venture
a judgment about vagueness without knowing how a law operates in practice.
A law that seems vague may be far less so when taken in the context of
public and private practices. Note. for example, that on the day after it
invalidated the Basic Rule, the Montana Supreme Court upheld the prohibition on
"reckless driving," notwithstanding the apparently unclear definition of
"reckless driving" as operating "any vehicle in willful or wanton disregard
for the safety of persons or property." 246 The constitutional question is what
legal terms are taken to mean, by public and private actors, and a seemingly
open-ended term may be proved far less open-ended by practice.</p>
          <p>The evidence that we have discussed does provide considerable support
for the Court's ruling. As we have seen, diverse law enforcement officials
interpret the basic law in diverse ways, and motorists cannot always know,
with precision and in advance, how much speed is excessive. The strongest
opinion for invalidation might have been empirical, emphasizing the
unmistakable record of uncertainty and arbitrariness.</p>
          <p>We think, however, that it was probably premature for the Court to
invalidate the law. There is some evidence of an increasing degree of clarity
about the circumstances in which drivers will be found to violate the law. At
the very least, there seems to have been an emerging judgment about what

          <p>kinds of driving behavior would count as unreasonable and imprudent.
Motorists, and grudgingly, law enforcement, were adjusting to the law.</p>
          <p>Probably the best outcome would have been for the Court to reserve
judgment on the ultimate issue with a holding that the defendant in the case
was certainly on notice that he was not driving prudently. If the Court had
reserved judgment on the due process issue, by showing that the particular
defendant could not claim a lack of notice, it might have encouraged chief
law enforcement authorities to provide greater guidance to the driving public,
perhaps through illustrative examples of speeds that would be considered
reasonable and speeds that would be considered unreasonable in diverse
circumstances.</p>
          <p>It remains to be seen how Montana will respond to the ruling of its
Supreme Court. A revised version of the Basic Rule might attempt to provide
greater clarity through some kind of standard ceiling, or it might, in the
spirit of the Basic Rule, use guidelines and exemplars. It might even require
the adoption of guidelines and exemplars by law enforcement officials; the
Court was obviously troubled by the failure of law enforcement to provide
greater clarity for the driving public. On the basis of the evidence discussed
here, we believe that it is legitimate to ask for greater guidance for rule of
law purposes. But in a case in which the largest issues might best have been
left undecided, the Court may well have invalidated the Basic Rule
prematurely, at least in the absence of a more detailed factual report.</p>
          <p>CONCLUSION</p>
          <p>Montana's Basic Rule appears to be a simple proposition: During daytime
hours on the state's highways and interstates, motorists must drive in a
"reasonable and prudent" manner. Yet the Rule's impact on America's
fourth largest state, its roadways, its courtrooms, and its residents, has
proven to be anything but simple.</p>
          <p>Enacted in accordance with Montana's libertarian principles, the Basic
Rule drew national attention but caused no substantial difference in
Montanans' driving habits in the short term. Although the average speed increased
by a non-trivial amount from 72 mph to 78 mph, most Montanans continued
driving at approximately the same speed. While remaining within historical
fluctuation ranges, the state's total fatalities decreased during 1996, soared in
1997, and declined again in 1998; it remains unclear if this variation is
attributable to the change in law or to some other factor or set of factors. The
underlying lesson appears to be that driving habits are only partly a function
of law. Probably the most discernible effect of the Rule is that Montana has
become a "speed magnet," attracting tourists who view Montana's interstates
as race tracks. It is also clear that the Basic Rule created several complex
tradeoffs. Highway safety, fuel efficiency, air quality, and Montana's
reputation suffered under the Basic Rule. Probable economic efficiency,
increased social ties, shorter driving times, and personal satisfaction stand as
benefits.</p>
          <p>Enforcement is perhaps the biggest problem with the Basic Rule.
Although ticket revenues have increased, roadside confrontations, accident
investigations and court appearances also have increased, depleting the already
scant resources of the Highway Patrol and judiciary. Furthermore, the
subjective standard has proven an onerous task to administer. Arbitrary and
inconsistent enforcement by the police, prosecutors, and judges impedes
citizens' compliance and the law's effectiveness. Legislative attempts to
reinstate a numerical speed limit have failed amidst geographic, age and
gender factionalization. However, in late 1998, a sharply divided Montana
Supreme Court invalidated the daytime speed limit as unconstitutionally vague,
a move we have criticized in light of the insufficient factual record of the
case.</p>
          <p>A more consistent application of the law might have reduced some of
these problems and may have prevented, or at least forestalled, the recent
Montana Supreme Court's action. Recent evidence of declining roadway
fatalities and Basic Rule citations may indicate that drivers were adapting to
the flexible standard. Furthermore, as Montanans, tourists, the Highway
Patrol, prosecutors and judges became more accustomed to "reasonable and
prudent" travel, a consensus might have emerged, reducing the difficulty of
establishing workable standards for law enforcement and the judiciary.</p>
          <p>An overall evaluation of the law and its consequences would require more
time and data. Even at this early date the transition from the 55 mph limit to
the Basic Rule offers some significant lessons. It highlights the important
role that social norms play in generating driving behavior. It reveals how a
state may become a speed magnet or a speed repellent. It also illustrates the
need to assess a number of effects in order to evaluate a change in
transportation policy. Finally, the study demonstrates the palpable adverse effects of
a vague, highly subjective standard on law enforcement. These lessons do
not permit any simple or straightforward verdict on the Basic Rule. But they
do bear on a number of recurrent debates in private and public law, most
notably the choice between rules and standards, and the relationship between
law and social norms.</p>
