A New Executive Order for Improving Federal Regulation?
Deeper and Wider Cost-Benefit Analysis
Robert W. Hahn and Cass R. Sunstein
I. Introduction A. Processes and Problems
For over twenty years, the executive branch of the federal government has required regulatory agencies to assess the costs and benefits of regulation, and to attempt to ensure that the benefits outweigh, or justify, the costs.1 At least in a formal sense, cost-benefit balancing is now the official creed of the executive branch, as demonstrated by a series of executive The point cuts across partisan divisions: President Clinton?s approach differed somewhat from President Reagan?s, but it shared the fundamental commitment to cost-benefit balancing.3
Notwithstanding this public commitment, national regulation has hardly come into compliance with the principles of cost-benefit This overall pattern of imperfect compliance should raise many alarm bells, even for those who have real doubts about costbenefit analysis and merely want more coherence and better priority-setting. The general record does show numerous successes, in the form of regulations that promise to deliver significant benefits at a relatively low But in many cases, regulations seem to do more harm than good.6 Indeed, a close look at federal regulatory policy shows a wide range of problems. Perhaps foremost among them is exceptionally poor priority-setting, with substantial resources
sometimes going to small problems, and with little attention being paid to some serious problems.7 There are also unnecessarily high costs, with $146 to $229 billion being attributable to compliance costs each
We do not contend that an assessment of quantified costs and quantified benefits tells us everything that we need to know or that precise numbers are always possible9 But when the costs are high and the benefits low or nonexistent, something seems seriously amiss, especially because an absence of significant benefits signals a likely absence of significant savings in terms of health, safety, or the environment. Especially in a period in which economic growth and improved safety and health are among government?s highest priorities, this is a major problem. And indeed, the recent reports of the Office of Management and Budget (?OMB?), designed to capture the costs and benefits of a wide range of regulations, reveal some disturbing numbers: the EPA?s regulation for financial assurance for municipal solid waste landfills has monetized benefits of $0, but costs of $100 million, and this is expected for the next thirteen years for the next thirteen years, OSHA?s methylene chloride regulation will have annual costs of $100 million and annual benefits of $40 million the cost-benefit ratio for airbag depowering regulation seems bad, though there is uncertainty in the

It might seem that existing executive orders would prevent or reduce outcomes of this kind, but apparently these orders have not had a large effect.14 Indeed, there is some evidence that the existing orders have had little impact on what agencies actually
This is no mere academic objection. Expensive regulation may well increase prices, reduce wages, and increase unemployment (and hence poverty).16 Resources now being devoted to small or imaginary problems might be diverted instead to areas where, by all accounts, they could produce far more good. Cost-benefit analysis is not an effort to reduce all human goods to

numbers, but to increase the likelihood that regulation will actually produce human good. According to one study, better allocations of health expenditures could save, each year, 60,000 additional lives at no additional cost??and such allocations could maintain the current level of lives saved with $31 billion in annual savings.17 We do not believe that cost-benefit analysis should be the exclusive basis for assessing regulation, but we do believe that it is an important tool, and that a movement toward improved balancing is likely to promote many social goals, including better health and increased This somewhat abstract claim has been dramatized by repeated demonstrations that some regulations create significant substitute risks19? ?and that with cheaper, more effective tools, regulation could achieve its basic goals while saving billions of
B. A Deeper and Wider Commitment to Cost-Benefit Analysis
How can regulation be moved in more sensible directions? This is a large question, and we will not attempt to answer it thoroughly here. But it seems to us that much of the answer lies in improved institutions, and, in particular, in institutional reforms that increase the role of costbenefit analysis in regulatory policy as a way of drawing attention to the likely effects of alternative courses of action. Of course statutory changes would be necessary in many cases. We emphasize two points here. First, the commitment to cost-benefit analysis has been far too superficial, and in some ways mostly symbolic it should be deepened through efforts to strengthen its actual role. Second, the commitment to cost-benefit analysis has been far too narrow it should be widened through efforts to incorporate independent regulatory commissions within its reach.
In this Article, we propose and explore a modest but potentially significant step toward greater depth and width: a new executive order on federal regulation, building on lessons derived from the experience of the last two decades. The proposed order, designed to replace the current one offers eight basic innovations over existing practice. Most of these address the issue of depth the last point goes to the issue of width.
1. Promoting Compliance. Our proposal attempts to ensure that agencies will actually comply with the basic principles established in previous orders, in part by explicitly requiring agency compliance with OMB guidelines for regulatory analysis. This would be an extremely significant step, because OMB?s guidelines have been widely ignored,21 and because compliance with those guidelines would significantly increase rationality and coherence in the regulatory process.
2. ?Prompting? Regulation. Our proposed order strengthens the role of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (?OIRA?) and explicitly creates a mechanism by which OIRA might ?prompt? regulation as well as constrain it. This is an important way to ensure that cost-benefit analysis will be used not simply to reduce and limit regulation, but also to spur regulation in those cases where it will do more good than By creating a mechanism for prompting regulation, our order moves cost-benefit analysis in the direction of service as a technical tool for improving regulation, rather than simply being a mechanism for reducing it.
3. Considering Substitute Risks and Not Regulating Trivial Problems. We include explicit requirements that, to the extent permitted by law, agencies (a) consider the substitute risks introduced by regulation and (b) do not attempt to regulate trivial or de minimis problems. These requirements build on some important developments within the federal courts, which have created default rules authorizing agencies to consider substitute risks and to make de minimis exceptions from regulatory requirements.23 These default rules are mirrored in federal
legislation, which often bars regulation of trivial risks,24 and which also calls, in many places, for attention to substitute risks.25
4. Explaining Rationales for Action When Benefits Do Not Exceed Costs. We require that benefits should generally be expected to exceed costs, and ask agencies to provide a rationale for proceeding with any regulation that fails to pass a cost-benefit test (based on best quantifiable Some statutes explicitly require agencies to act even if the benefits fall short of the There may also be cases in which an agency believes that it is worthwhile to proceed even though the quantifiable benefits do not exceed the quantifiable costs. Either way, we believe that accountability and transparency would be enhanced if the head of an agency were required to explain why a regulation is being adopted.
5. Making Underlying Analysis Available. For each significant regulatory action, we ask the appropriate agency to include an underlying analysis of the benefits and costs, so that interested parties inside and outside of the government can understand how the results were obtained, and perform their own analysis of the issue if they so choose. We believe that this requirement will also promote transparency and enhance accountability.
6. Formulating Regulatory Retrospective and Plan. We require each agency to create an annual regulatory retrospective and an annual regulatory plan. The retrospective should contain a general analysis of the costs and benefits of significant regulations this analysis will facilitate OMB?s statutory task of compiling an annual account for the executive branch as a The annual regulatory plan, following a similar requirement in the existing executive would contain an account of what the agency aspires to do in the following year. The purpose of the regulatory plan is to ensure early, rather than last-minute, OIRA involvement in planning, and also to promote the involvement of high-level agency staff at an early stage.
7. Incorporating Independent Agencies. For the first time, we include the independent regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (?FTC?), Consumer Product Safety Commission (?CPSC?), and Federal Communications Commission (?FCC?), within the ambit of the order. This is a significant departure from existing practice. We believe that the innovation is justified because these agencies are engaged in particularly important regulatory functions. The inclusion of independent agencies raises obvious legal issues, which we discuss
8. Authorizing Judicial Review. We provide for limited judicial review of the documents and materials generated as a result of the order. The goal of this provision is to increase the likelihood that agencies will take the order?s requirements seriously. It also authorizes the invalidation of arbitrary and capricious agency action, to the extent that the relevant materials are pertinent, as a matter of law, in a test of the legality of agency conduct.
We believe that a new executive order is probably the best way to move in the directions suggested by these ideas. There are, however, reasonable counterarguments. For well over a year, the Bush Administration has been operating under an executive order issued by President Clinton, and there are real virtues in a situation in which regulatory oversight under a president of one party is done under a set of principles issued by another. It is important to give such oversight both the reality and the appearance of nonpartisanship. A possible approach would be to retain the Clinton order and to issue a supplemental order that embodies some of the proposals described here. In any case many of the ideas in this Essay might be promoted without a new order. Greater depth, at least, might well be achieved simply by a stronger effort, by OIRA, to ensure compliance with existing requirements,31 and, indeed, by an insistence on many of the proposals made here.32 If a new executive order were not to be issued, considerable progress might well be made with these suggestions in mind. For those who lack enthusiasm for our recommendations, we hope that the discussion will nonetheless cast light on the actual performance of the federal government after twenty years of experience under a (nominal)
commitment to cost-benefit analysis.33 Indeed, some critics will be pleased to see the modest effects of cost-benefit requirements to date.34
This Article is organized as follows. Part I briefly outlines the development of executive orders on federal regulation. At the same time, it provides an account of what we mean by the still-controversial idea of cost-benefit balancing, and an exploration of the lessons from two decades of experience with executive orders on federal regulation. We emphasize here the extent to which the commitment to cost-benefit analysis has been, too much of the time, symbolic rather than real. Part II explains and defends our innovations. Part III explores the limits of reform via executive order, and offers an account of what else might be done. Following a brief conclusion, the attached Appendix contains the text of our proposed executive order.
A. What is Cost-Benefit Analysis?
Before proceeding to the details, it is important to clarify our basic understanding of costbenefit analysis. We mean to use the term in a modest, nonsectarian way, seeing cost-benefit analysis as a tool and a procedure, rather than as a rigid formula to govern Thus understood, cost-benefit analysis requires a full accounting of the consequences of an action, in both quantitative and qualitative terms. Officials should have this accounting before them when they make decisions.
We do not insist that regulators should be bound by the ?bottom-line? numbers qualitative considerations, and a sense of distributive impacts (not themselves considered ?benefits? in the analysis), are permitted to influence public officials. But if regulators are to proceed, they should be prepared to explain either how the benefits exceed the costs, or if they do not, why it is nonetheless worthwhile to go forward. When the benefits do not exceed the costs, it would make sense to adopt a presumption against proceeding??a presumption that might
II. Clarifications and Preliminaries
be rebutted by showing, for example, that children would be the principal beneficiaries of the regulation, or that poor people would be disproportionately benefited. We therefore understand cost-benefit analysis to require a certain procedure: A quantitative and qualitative accounting of the effects of regulation, together with a duty to explain the grounds for action unless the benefits exceed the costs. On this view, the antonym to regulation guided by cost-benefit analysis is regulation undertaken without anything like a clear sense of the likely consequences??or regulation that amounts to a stab in the
What are the arguments for cost-benefit analysis, so understood? We do not attempt to answer this question in but it is important to see the central points. The standard response is economic in character: Regulation should ordinarily promote social welfare, and while social welfare might be promoted by regulations that fail cost-benefit analysis,38 costbenefit analysis is an imperfect but useful and administrable proxy for the inquiry into the social welfare question. At the very least, it seems clear that regulation is unlikely to promote social welfare when its costs are very high and its benefits are very low??especially when we consider the fact that high costs are likely to be translated into some combination of higher prices, lower wages, and lower returns to capital. It is not necessary to think that government should be treated as some maximizing machine in order to conclude that officials should know the consequences of regulation before they act, and that they should be reluctant to issue regulations that promise to cost much and to deliver little.
Of course it is possible that in practice, quantitative cost-benefit analysis will have excessive influence on government decisions, drowning out ?soft variables.? Since the numbers are not all that matters, any such effect would be a point against cost-benefit analysis. But to date, the actual record does not support this concern. To take just one example, the EPA?s
decision to go forward with new controls on arsenic in drinking water was supported partly on the ground that nonquantifiable variables tipped the balance. We will suggest that in appropriate cases, distributional considerations should also count. The risk that cost-benefit analysis will drown out relevant variables is not a reason to abandon the analysis, but to take steps to ensure against any such effect.
It is useful to compare cost-benefit analysis with the ?precautionary principle,? often invoked as a foundation for risk regulation and indeed as an alternative to cost-benefit The precautionary principle asks government to prevent risks, even if they are quite speculative, on the ground that it is important to guard against large problems even if they might not come to fruition. Of course it is worthwhile to take some precautions against serious risks, even if the probability of their occurrence is well under 100%. We think, however, that the precautionary principle is an inadequate guide to action, simply because dangers often lie on both sides of the
Consider the case of genetic modification of food, a process that does carry some risks: A failure to allow genetic modification might well result in many deaths, and a small probability of many more, simply because genetic modification might well deliver cheaper and healthier Doesn?t the precautionary principle require genetic modification of food at least as much as it prohibits it?
Or consider the question whether to ban the use of DDT. The precautionary principle might well seem to require the ban, because DDT imposes health risks for birds and mammals, including human beings. But the ban itself seems to be banned by the principle, because any such ban might lead to either unsafe or more expensive substitutes, and in either case the ban creates a
(speculative) risk of serious harms.42 Or consider an effort to introduce stringent regulation of arsenic in drinking water. It is possible to justify the regulation on the ground that low levels of arsenic might create substantial risks but it is also possible to complain that the expensive regulation (costing, say, $200 million) itself creates a risk of mortality effects, a risk that would be forbidden by the precautionary principle. What should government do?
The precautionary principle, taken for all that it is worth, is thus frequently paralyzing: It stands as an obstacle to regulation and to nonregulation, and to everything in between. Of course speculative harms often deserve attention. But we think that too much of the time, the precautionary principle is merely a combination of rhetoric and myopia, having force only when people look at an essentially arbitrary part of the picture, rather than at the whole. A competent cost-benefit analysis takes good account of what is sensible in the precautionary principle, by asking regulators to attend to low-probability risks of significant harms. Cost-benefit analysis subsumes this risk, as it does all others, into the overall assessment of welfare effects of regulation.43 Indeed the most sensible understandings of the precautionary principle emphasize the need for an overall assessment, and insist on exploring all of the risks at stake, including lowprobability, potentially catastrophic
A less familiar argument for cost-benefit analysis, growing out of our doubts about the precautionary principle, is cognitive in character. One goal of cost-benefit analysis is to overcome cognitive limitations by ensuring that people have a full, rather than limited, sense of what is at People often miss the systemic effects of risk regulation cost-benefit analysis is a way of putting those effects squarely on-screen. At the same time, cost-benefit analysis helps overcome the problems created by cognitive heuristics that can lead people to misunderstand the magnitude of risks, by allowing an accounting of the actual consequences of
current hazards and of the effects of reducing them.47 To the extent that people?s emotions are getting the better of them, by producing massive concern about small risks,48 cost-benefit analysis should help put things in perspective, and at the same time might help to calm popular fears. And if people are indifferent to a risk that is actually quite large, cost-benefit analysis will help to stir them out of their torpor. The result should be to help with cognitive distortions and to produce sensible priority setting.
There are democratic advantages as Interest groups often manipulate policy in their preferred directions, sometimes by exaggerating risks, sometimes by minimizing them, and sometimes by mobilizing public sentiment in their preferred directions. An effort to produce a fair accounting of actual dangers should help to diminish the danger of interest-group manipulation. More generally, cost-benefit analysis should increase the likelihood that citizens generally, and officials in particular, will be informed of what is actually at stake. By itself, this is a large democratic gain.
Of course, interest groups will also try to manipulate the numbers in their preferred directions. Industry will tend to exaggerate the costs and minimize the risks. Public interest groups will do the opposite. A government that attempts to produce cost-benefit analysis will face a formidable task it is possible that government will lack the information necessary to do this task well. But if there is a degree of accuracy, and if ranges are specified where there is uncertainty, cost-benefit analysis can be seen, not as some antidemocratic effort to tyrannize people with numbers, but instead as an indispensable tool of democratic self-government.
We can go further. Prospective estimates of both costs and benefits often turn out to be wrong.50 This is not merely because of interest group pressures. One reason is that officials lack the extensive information that would permit them to take accurate predictions indeed, the informational demand on agencies is overwhelmingly, especially because technologies change
over time.51 An enduring problem for regulatory policy is the absence of precise information on the cost or benefit sides. This point should be taken, not as a criticism of cost-benefit analysis as such, but as a reason for continuous monitoring and Our emphasis on retrospective analysis and on prompt letters is intended to take account of the frequent inadequacy of prospective estimates.
There are numerous challenges to cost-benefit analysis as a regulatory We cannot discuss those challenges in this space. We suspect that many of them are rooted, at bottom, in pragmatic considerations-?in a belief that in practice, cost-benefit analysis will be used as an obstacle to desirable regulation. According to some skeptics, the antonym of cost-benefit analysis is not the unguided stab in the dark, but regulatory protection itself. If this were so, the argument for cost-benefit analysis would be greatly weakened. But the evidence does not support this pessimistic prediction indeed, cost-benefit analysis has helped to spur regulation, not merely to stop We believe that, in principle, cost-benefit analysis has a great deal of promise, and that when it has been used, it has often made things better rather than worse.56 Of course, the case for cost-benefit analysis will depend, in large part, on what people do with it in the future.
B. History
Since 1980, all three branches of American government have shown increased interest in cost-benefit Our emphasis here is on the actions of the executive branch, which has had a longstanding interest in cost-benefit balancing, an interest that cuts across partisan divisions.58 A brief historical review will set the stage.
President Nixon inaugurated the process of this general sort as long ago as 1970, with a mechanism for ?Quality of Life? reviews of administrative action.59 President Carter introduced a similar process with his Regulatory Analysis Review Group, designed to conduct interagency analysis of cost-effectiveness analysis, required for ?significant? rules.60 But the decisive step came under President Reagan, with the formal creation of a mechanism for OMB review of major regulations.
The most important innovations in President Reagan?s Executive Order 12,291 were: (1) a set of substantive principles for all agencies to follow, ?to the extent permitted by law,? including a commitment to cost-benefit analysis (2) a requirement that a Regulatory Impact Analysis, including cost-benefit analysis, accompany all ?major? rules and (3) a formal mechanism for OMB oversight, with a general understanding that OMB had some (undefined) substantive control over what agencies would actually do. President Reagan considered subjecting the independent agencies to the new order, but ultimately declined to do so, partly because of concerns about legal authority, but mostly because of fears of an adverse congressional reaction.61 The independent agencies were asked voluntarily to comply with Executive Order 12,291 all of them declined.
Executive Order 12,291 proved extremely Nonetheless, President Reagan expanded on the basic idea four years later with Executive Order 12,498.63 That order established a requirement that agencies submit ?annual regulatory plans? to OMB for review. The result was an annual publication, the Regulatory Program of the United States, which contains a discussion of all proposed actions that might be either costly or controversial. Executive Order 12,498 served to increase the authority of agency heads over their staffs, by exposing proposals to toplevel review at an early stage. But it also increased the authority of OMB, by allowing OMB supervision over basic plans, and by making it hard for agencies to proceed without OMB preclearance.
Under President George Bush, the principal innovation was the Council on Competitiveness, chaired by the Vice President.64 The Council engaged in occasional review of agency rules, operating as a kind of supervisor of OMB itself. It also set out a number of principles and proposals for regulatory reform.65 In essence, however, the Bush Administration followed the basic approach of its predecessor, with OMB review remaining under the two Reagan executive orders.
Cost-benefit balancing had been highly controversial when conducted by Republican administrations. For this reason, it was uncertain whether President Clinton would allow it to continue to play a role within the executive branch. But in a significant and dramatic step, President Clinton endorsed the essential features of the Reagan-Bush orders in his Executive Order 12,866.66 The crucial point about Clinton?s order is that it accepted the basic commitments of the two Reagan-Bush orders, by requiring agencies to assess both costs and benefits and to proceed only when the latter justified the former. At the same time, President Clinton offered several changes to the Reagan-Bush processes, mainly attempting to create assurances against the fear of industry capture of the system of review. First, he attempted to diminish public concerns about interest-group power over regulation, by providing a process to resolve conflicts and procedures for greater Second, he included references to ?equity,? to ?distributive impacts,? and to qualitative as well as quantitative factors, evidently so as to ensure that agencies could make adjustments in the process of decision, and abandon the cost-benefit assessment where this seems Third, President Clinton moved, in a modest but important way, toward including independent agencies within the executive orders. He did so by requiring the participation of the independent agencies within the unified regulatory agenda69 and also by requiring independent agencies to submit their proposals for inclusion within the annual
regulatory plan, allowing the Vice President an opportunity to advise and consult.70 We will build on these initiatives here.
Congress has been slower to support efforts to require the balancing of benefits and costs of major regulations. In 1982 the Senate unanimously passed such a law, but it was defeated in the House of Representatives.71 Two primary environmental statutes that allowed the balancing of benefits and costs prior to the mid-1990s are the Toxic Substances Control and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Recently, Congress has shown greater interest in emphasizing the balancing of benefits and costs. Table 2 reviews recent regulatory reform initiatives, which could help improve regulation and legislation. The table suggests that Congress now shares the concern of the executive branch that the regulatory system is in need of repair and could benefit from more in the way of economic analysis.74 All reforms highlighted in the table emphasize a trend towards considering the benefits and costs of regulation, although the effectiveness of the provisions remains unclear. Perhaps because of the politicized nature of the debate over regulatory reform, these reform efforts have come about in a piecemeal fashion, and there is some overlap in the requirements for analysis.75

CBO is required to estimate the costs of laws with
new mandates in excess of $50 million in any one

in excess of $100 million in any one year on the

agency must prepare a cost-benefit analysis of
regulations with new mandates in excess of $100
million in any one year on state, local, and tribal
governments or the private sector. The agency is
required to choose the ?least costly, most costeffective, or least burdensome alternative,? unless
the provisions are inconsistent with law or the
head of an agency can explain why such an
alternative was not adopted. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996

General Accounting Office. Congress has at least
sixty calendar days to review major regulations
before they can become effective. During that
time, Congress can enact a joint resolution of
disapproval that, if passed and then signed by the
president, would void the regulation. In addition,
strengthened judicial review provisions hold
agencies more accountable for the impacts of
regulations on small entities. Regulatory Accountability Provision of 1996, 1997, and 1998
In separate appropriations legislation in 1996,
1997, and 1998, Congress required the Office of
Management and Budget to submit an assessment
of the annual benefits and costs of all existing
federal regulatory programs to Congress for 1997,
1998, and 2000, respectively. The Office of
Management and Budget already must review
and approve analyses submitted by agencies
estimating the costs and benefits of major
proposed rules. The annual report provisions build on this review process. The Secretary of Transportation must issue a pipeline standard ?only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended standard justify its costs.? This Act eliminates the Delaney Clause for pesticides that set a zero-tolerance standard for carcinogens from residues in processed foods. In setting standards for raw or processed foods, the EPA will now establish a tolerance level to ensure ?a reasonable certainty of no harm? from pesticide residues. For pesticide products that exceed that negligible risk, the EPA may consider the benefits of the pesticide to justify granting a tolerance. Under the original act, the maximum contaminant level (MCL) was to be set as close to the maximum contaminant level goal as ?feasible.? Feasible was defined as using the best technology available ?taking costs into consideration.? Under the new act, the EPA administrator ?shall publish a determination as to whether the benefits of the MCL justify, or do not justify, the costs.?

(1) to review biennially its regulations pertaining
to telecommunications service providers and
broadcast ownership and (2) to determine
whether economic competition has made those
regulations no longer necessary in the public
interest.
Courts, too, have shown interest in cost-benefit principles, developing a set of default rules that authorize agencies to minimize costs and maximize benefits, in the face of statutory ambiguity. Consider the following all with support in the cases. Unless Congress has clearly said otherwise, agencies will be permitted to make de minimis exceptions to statutory

requirements by exempting small risks from regulatory controls.78 Unless Congress has clearly said otherwise, agencies will be permitted to balance the health risks created by regulation against the health benefits created by Unless Congress has clearly said otherwise, agencies will be permitted to take costs into account in issuing regulations. In its current form, this principle means that where statutes are ambiguous, agencies will have the authority to consider costs as well as Unless Congress has clearly said otherwise, agencies will be permitted to decline to regulate past the point where regulation would be economically or technologically feasible.81 Unless Congress has clearly said otherwise, agencies will be expected to balance costs against benefits in issuing
These principles give the executive branch a great deal of room to maneuver because they authorize agencies, when so inclined, to move regulation in more cost-beneficial directions. We will draw on some of these principles in the discussion to follow.
C. The Record
One of the basic motivations for reforming the regulatory process is that with sensible reforms, regulators should be able to achieve what everyone would consider to be better social outcomes at lower cost. Table 3 provides that motivation by showing the cost per statistical life saved for a number of final regulations at the Environmental Protection Agency from 1986 to 1994. We acknowledge that tables of this kind cannot tell us everything that we need to know about regulation but we believe that enormous disparities of this sort are enough to create a
strong presumption of irrationality and incoherence in regulation. In our view, no one has suggested a basis for rebutting that presumption.84

There are two key points to note from this table. First, the cost per statistical life saved spans an extraordinarily wide range?from $9 billion to over $40 billion. Second, there are ample opportunities to save more lives at less cost, simply because of these significant differences in the cost per statistical life saved. Taking advantage of these opportunities would require reallocating expenditures away from those regulations that are least cost-effective and toward those regulations that are most The consensus among those who study this area is that there is great potential to develop regulations that achieve social objectives at lower cost because of the differences in cost-effectiveness among regulations aimed at achieving the same (or similar) objectives. Note that OIRA appears to agree, having urged a number of new initiatives via the new institution of the ?prompt letter,? taken up
Unfortunately, no institution in the federal government now has, as its primary aim, the goal of targeting regulatory expenditures to their best uses.88 Instead, the primary instrument used to review the effectiveness of federal regulations is the regulatory oversight required by the executive orders discussed above. For the most part, this oversight occurs on a regulation-byregulation basis.89 OMB?s job consists of meeting with officials and reviewing each Regulatory Impact Analysis (?RIA?) that is prepared for economically significant Each RIA
provides a rich source of data for examining the costs and benefits of regulation as well as the cost-effectiveness of selected regulations.
How has the process worked in practice? Our basic answer, documented below, is that the process has not worked extremely well. Unfortunately, it is difficult to gauge the effectiveness of federal executive regulatory oversight and the executive orders themselves. The basic problem is that we have very few natural experiments that provide useful information. One of the present authors used a data set and found that the introduction of OIRA did not appear to affect the cost-effectiveness of regulations, contrary to his hypothesis.91 He is reluctant to conclude, however, that OIRA does not have an Farrow used a similar data set, but included regulations that are rejected as well as those that are finalized. He found that the costeffectiveness of a rule does not have a large impact on the decision to reject or accept that rule.93 Farrow argued that this provides evidence that OIRA has not had an impact, at least as measured in terms of improvements in cost-effectiveness for those rules that are Eric Posner reaches similar conclusions, urging that cost-benefit review is less a tool for improving regulation than for increasing presidential control over agencies.95
Another way of gauging the effectiveness of regulatory oversight is to measure the quality of each RIA itself. The information provided in an RIA is often badly incomplete, and the level of detail and analytical sophistication varies across agencies and types of regulations.96 In some cases the most basic information, about both benefits and costs, is missing. Common deficiencies include inadequate consideration of alternatives, poor treatment of uncertainty, incomplete estimation of benefits and costs, as well as various methodological errors.97
Moreover, different assumptions are applied across regulations.98 Indeed, comprehensive analyses of the RIAs suggest that they lack analytical consistency and that agencies only superficially comply with the requirements in the Reagan and Clinton executive orders. A study of forty-eight major health, safety, and environmental regulations from mid-1996 to mid-1999 provided evidence that agencies generally failed to comply with the executive order and adhere to the OMB
From an evaluation of the record on executive regulatory oversight, we conclude that the commitment to cost-benefit analysis is as much symbolic as real. There is not strong evidence that the Executive Orders or the oversight process has made a substantial difference in policy outcomes. Moreover, there is evidence that the cost-benefit analyses included as part of the regulatory oversight process suffer from serious flaws.
The major goal of our proposed executive order is to deepen and widen the commitment to cost-benefit analysis. We propose to strengthen the role of OIRA, to offer stricter and clearer principles and requirements, and to ensure a more transparent, coherent, and uniform process at the agency level. We also propose to include the independent agencies within the process of OIRA review. As we shall emphasize, an executive order, by itself, will not do a great deal to change the system of regulation. As suggested by the record of the last two decades, everything depends on matters of implementation. But a new order would itself be a strong signal of a new commitment both to cost-benefit balancing and to OIRA and the suggested innovations would, we believe, hold out considerable promise for improving the situation.
III. Proposed Innovations
A. Promoting Compliance We have seen that the track record on compliance with regulatory oversight requirements is much less than There is no simple solution for the compliance problem. Political will on the part of high-level officials is a key component, but even with political will, agencies might be able to act strategically and game the system.
Keeping these points in mind, we offer two suggestions for compliance: First, OMB should issue a modified set of guidelines on how to perform the analysis that is required in the RIA and on how to evaluate that analysis before it is submitted to OMB. If these guidelines are not met, then the proposed regulation should be returned to the agency until the analysis meets OMB?s guidelines. Second, for important regulations, OIRA should work with the agency to agree on a set of key assumptions and alternatives to be used in the analysis.101 If the terms of this agreement are violated, then OIRA can elect to return the proposed In our approach, the guidelines would have a far more prominent place than they now do. For this reason, we think that the guidelines should be subject to public review and comment before they are finalized. The ordinary process, for notice and comment via the Federal Register, should suffice here, as
In terms of substance, the most recent guidelines issued by OMB represent a good start, but we would go further.104 Specifically, the following steps would increase transparency in the regulatory process and improve the quality of regulatory analysis. With the exception of the last step, we have not listed them in the Executive Order itself, on the theory that they are too specific and detailed to belong there. We believe, however, that OMB should require such steps:
1. Agencies should post each regulatory impact analysis and supporting documents on the Internet before a draft proposed or final regulation can be considered in the regulatory review process
2. Agency analyses should include a clear, brief executive summary (no more than one page) that contains information on costs, benefits, and technical information, and that says whether the best estimate of quantifiable benefits associated with the regulation is likely to exceed the best estimate of associated costs, and whether it can be expected to maximize net
A summary of key aspects of the regulation should be included in a table at the beginning of each RIA.106 Table 4 provides an example of a summary table. This table could promote accountability by allowing OMB and other interested parties to evaluate how well agencies are doing in reporting different kinds of information.

3. Agencies should be required to calculate the net benefits of a regulation based on the best available quantitative information.108
4. Agencies should use some default assumptions for standard parameters in order to facilitate comparison within and across regulations. For example, OMB should specify a default discount rate along with a range. Similarly, OMB should specify the value of a quality-adjusted life year and appropriate ranges along with the value of a statistical life and We recognize that these values may, with good reason, differ across different regulations nonetheless, there is also merit in having a methodology that is fairly standard. Agencies should be permitted to use alternative assumptions where they can provide a good rationale that has a basis in
5. Each federal regulatory agency should be required to produce an annual report on the benefits and costs of regulatory activities. Requiring annual reports would make the regulatory process more transparent, and could improve estimates of the economic impact of regulatory activity. In addition, the agency reports would help the OMB produce its overall assessment of the impact of federal regulation. We add some details below.111
B. Prompts and Returns
Our Executive Order also gives an explicit place for the idea of ?prompt letters,? an innovation introduced in the early months of the Bush To understand this idea, some brief background is in order.
Throughout its history, OIRA?s basic mission has been to stop unjustified rules, mainly through the use of ?return letters,? which require agencies to reconsider their proposals. Yet studies show that adding some regulations, while removing or improving others, could save tens
of thousands of lives and millions of dollars annually.113 An important priority for the future is to redesign existing institutions and agencies by adding regulations that make sense, while reducing those that do not. One of our primary concerns is that no institution in government has yet vindicated the hopes of those who believed that cost-benefit analysis could be used to help promote better priority-setting, block senseless rules, and spur agency action when it is justified.
In 2001, OIRA quietly announced a striking, if overdue, innovation: ?prompt letters,? designed to encourage agencies to explore new areas in which regulation might deliver benefits that exceed costs.114 Not only did OIRA announce the use of prompt letters it also issued two of them. One of those letters, to the Food and Drug Administration (?FDA?), involved mandatory disclosure of trans-fatty acids in the Nutrition Facts panel of Drawing attention to evidence that trans-fatty acids contribute to coronary heart disease (?CHD?), the letter noted that a disclosure rule seemed to be supported by the FDA?s preliminary analysis, which estimated that, ten years after the effective date, the rule would prevent 7,600 to 17,100 cases of CHD and avert 2,500 to 5,600 deaths per year. Over a 20-year period, the FDA estimated the benefits of such a rule would range from $25 billion to $59 billion, while the costs would be $400 million to $850 million. The prompt letter strongly encouraged the FDA to issue a disclosure rule or to explain its failure to do so.
The other prompt letter, involving automatic external defibrillators (?AEDs?), was sent to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, with a firm request that the agency ?consider whether promotion of AEDs should be elevated to a The letter referred to an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, noting that only 2% to 5% of the 225,000 persons who have sudden and unexpected cardiac arrest each year outside a hospital are successfully resuscitated compared to the 17% to 38% success rates found with AEDs. The prompt letter observed that ?some preliminary cost-effectiveness calculations? showed that ?AEDs in the workplace might prove to be a very cost-effective intervention.? Indeed AEDs, now mandated on air carriers by the Department of Transportation, are estimated to save nine lives per year, at the comparatively low price of $2.4 million in annual costs. The prompt letter
suggested that OSHA should consider following the Department of Transportation?s lead. OIRA has issued a series of prompt letters since the initial announcement, including a letter to the Department of Transportation and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regarding frontal offset crash testing, and a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency regarding particulate matter.118
In our view, these ?prompt letters? are an exceedingly important development. For far too long, the idea of cost-benefit analysis has been wrongly associated with dogmatic opposition to regulation. To be sure, an exploration of costs and benefits often shows that regulation cannot be justified. But cost-benefit analyses can show, and have shown, that government action is worthwhile??and indeed that government should do more. Such analyses helped encourage policymakers to remove lead from gasoline and protect the ozone layer.119 Prompt letters promise to strengthen the hand of policy analysts in the federal government, ensuring that action will be taken on the basis of a careful assessment of consequences, rather than in reaction to interest groups or political platitudes.
But why??it might be asked??should prompt letters be made public? Shouldn?t such letters be part of the informal, behind-the-scenes consultation that often occurs within the executive branch? This is not a simple question to answer, but in some ways public disclosure of prompt letters is a great virtue. Public disclosure promotes transparency and hence accountability. Equally important, public disclosure increases the likelihood that OIRA?s concerns will be taken seriously. In the end, agencies remain in charge of their own priorities but if OIRA?s suggestion is reasonable, public disclosure will give agencies an additional reason to investigate it with care.
It would be desirable in this regard for independent groups to play a role in recommending prompt letters. OIRA?s own resources are far too limited to enable it to consider all promising possibilities on its own.120 Environmental groups, for example, might conduct their own analyses to suggest that new steps ought to be taken to control certain pollutants. Institutions that investigate regulatory issues, and even individual observers from academia and elsewhere, might be provided with a forum by which they could suggest a prompt letter from OIRA. The supporting analysis might be developed privately and reviewed publicly. Steps of this sort might
simultaneously increase the quality of analysis and the level of public participation in the regulatory process.
In our proposed order, we have also given an explicit place to the idea of ?return letters.? Not only did OIRA announce the use of prompt letters it also issued four of them. But the practice of returning regulations lay dormant during the last years of the Clinton
and there is some value in making the power explicit, if only to give a clear signal that it should be exercised in appropriate circumstances.
C. De Minimis Exceptions, Substitute Risks, Equity, and Distribution
We have introduced two new principles, implicit in previous orders but deserving explicit recognition. We have also recast the treatment of equity and distributional effects.
1. De Minimis Exceptions. In a series of cases, courts have authorized agencies to exempt trivial risks from regulation, at least when Congress has not unambiguously denied agencies that authority.122 This principle is a modern version of an ancient idea: de minimis non curat lex. In the regulatory context, the principle has special importance. When risks are trivial, it is not likely to be worthwhile to eliminate them, partly because the effort distracts attention from more serious problems, partly because of the sheer expense of the effort. We have built the de minimis principle into the executive order, asking agencies not to deal with trivial problems.
2. Substitute Risks. The last decade has seen increasing attention devoted to the possibility that risk regulation will produce substitute It is well known that fuel economy standards for new cars could result in the production of smaller and less safe vehicles whatever the extent of this danger, we think it reasonable for government to take steps to avoid it. In the context of the EPA?s ozone standard, it was successfully urged that EPA should consider the possibility that regulation of ground-level ozone could actually increase health risks, by
increasing cataracts and skin cancers.124 Indeed, courts appear to be creating a new default principle, authorizing agencies to take account of the substitute risks introduced by regulation. The general problem is ubiquitous, and agencies should take corrective steps. We have built into the executive order a specific requirement that agencies attend to the problem.
3. Equity and Distribution. We propose to allow agencies to consider the distributional effects of regulation, and to proceed if an understanding of those effects justifies a departure from the ?bottom line? produced by cost-benefit calculations. This is a departure from the Reagan Order, which offered no reference to distributive effects.125 At the same time, we require agencies to offer a detailed explanation for proceeding if the costs significantly exceed the benefits. This is a departure from the Clinton Order, which provided somewhat vague references to both ?equity? and ?distributive impacts.?126 To understand these points, some background is in order.
A conventional objection to cost-benefit analysis is that it treats society as if it were an individual person, and disregards the fact that a regulation typically produces both winners and losers. Suppose, for example, that the costs of stricter controls on particulates are $500 million annually, and that the benefits are $350 million. Does this mean that the stricter controls are a bad idea? This is not so clear. Skeptics might urge that we need to know far more about the identity of the winners and the losers. Does the $500 million cost mean that corporate profits will decline, so that high-level corporate officials will have reduced salaries? Does it mean that prices will increase, and if so, are luxury items involved? Will the $350 million in benefits be enjoyed mostly by poor people? By children? Of course a measurement of benefits in terms of ?life years? would automatically extend special concern to children. Or by people who are elderly and already well off? Critics of cost-benefit analysis believe that in order to know whether to proceed, it is crucial not simply to tabulate both costs and benefits, but to ask and answer such questions.
Such critics have a point, but there are many complexities here. In some cases, those who benefit from regulation are the same as those who must pay for it, and hence questions of this kind need not arise. The EPA?s decision to regulate arsenic in drinking water is a recent
example.127 Often, of course, those who gain are not the same as those who lose. But it is wrong to think, as some people seem to do, that regulation typically imposes costs on wealthy corporations and delivers benefits to those in need??and hence that cost-benefit analysis is an unfortunate method for blocking desirable redistribution. The basic reason is that regulation is a crude and often ineffective tool for redistributing resources.128 If, for example, high costs are imposed on those who buy automobiles or gasoline, the victims will not be some abstractions called ?corporations.? On the contrary, it is highly likely that the costs will be felt by some combination of consumers (with price increases being especially hard on the poor), workers who must face lower wages, and people who are thrown into unemployment. And when regulation provides benefits, there is no general reason to think that low-income people will be the beneficiaries. In short, the incidence of regulatory benefits and burdens is not easy to untangle and the burdens are likely to be felt by real people, many of them far from wealthy. All that can be said for certain is that regulation is most unlikely to transfer resources from those who are well off to those who are needy.129
Invoking considerations of this kind, some people urge that cost-benefit analysis should be the exclusive basis for regulation, and that equity and distributional effects are all too likely to be used as an all-purpose basis for assistance not to those who are needy, but to powerful private groups.130 But we do not favor going so far as to bar consideration of distributive effects. We do believe that the idea of ?equity? is too vague to be helpful but in our view, agencies should be permitted to take account of distributive effects. Certainly they should do so when the context suggests that the benefits will go to people who are especially needy, and that the burdens will be imposed on people who can easily bear them??and also when the burdens would be imposed on the needy and the benefits enjoyed by those who are already very well off. Consider, for example, the fact that poor people have been the disproportionate winners from regulation of air
pollution.131 Consider also the fact that the burdens of stringent regulation of arsenic in drinking water are likely to be borne disproportionately by those who are relatively less well off.132 Though good data will often be absent, agencies should consider effects of this sort.
When the costs are far higher than the benefits, however, agencies should not allow distributive effects to be a kind of all-purpose justification for proceeding. Instead they should give a careful analysis of their approach. We believe that if the costs are grossly disproportionate to the benefits, there should be a strong presumption against regulation, rebuttable only in cases where the distributive argument is compelling.
D. Requiring Explanation When Benefits Do Not Exceed Costs
We believe that agencies should generally act only when the benefits exceed the costs. To be sure, this is not meant as a rigid requirement. Agencies should be permitted, in unusual circumstances, to act even when the numbers do not support their action. But in such cases, we ask an agency that chooses to proceed with a regulation that does not pass a cost-benefit test to provide a rationale for doing so. By ?does not pass? a benefit-cost test, we mean that the expected quantifiable costs are likely to exceed the quantifiable expected benefits, before taking distributional effects and any other relevant factor into account. Of course there are typically large uncertainties in developing the relevant estimates, and hence a large number of discretionary judgments must be made before generating the We think that OIRA administrator should decide when a proposed regulation does not pass a cost-benefit test based on her best judgment. OIRA administrator should be reasonably confident that the quantified net benefits of the proposed regulation are negative before requiring a rationale. For example, a margin on the order of ten million dollars annually could be set as a minimum threshold.
The agency head should be allowed to consider other relevant factors in her decisionmaking, including distributional effects. These factors should be quantified to the extent possible, even if they are not included in the cost-benefit analysis itself. The purpose of the
quantification is to make the analysis more transparent. We also believe that factors that cannot be easily be quantified should be factored into the analysis where relevant. In providing the rationale for proceeding, the agency head has an opportunity (and in our view, a duty) to provide a well-reasoned analytical justification for the decision reached. Requiring a rationale for proceeding when expected net benefits are negative will give the regulatory process more legitimacy, and should also lend legitimacy to the use of cost-benefit analysis as a tool for decision making.
Suppose, for example, that a new regulation of a certain air pollutant would have monetized benefits of $250 million, but monetized costs of $280 million. Suppose, too, that the benefits would come in the form of reduced illnesses among young people, and also reduced mortality effects for people who would otherwise have many additional years. Suppose as well that many of the beneficiaries of the regulation are poor, and that the costs of the regulation would mainly result in higher prices for certain products (say, cars and energy). The problem is not entirely simple, especially because increased energy prices hit poor people hardest but in this admittedly stylized example, an administrator might well be able to justify a decision to proceed even though the monetized costs exceed the monetized benefits.
E. Make Underlying Analysis Available
There has been a controversy over public access to data used in regulatory decisionThe controversy arose when the Environmental Protection Agency finalized a regulation on particulate matter in July of 1997 that gave the agency new power to regulate a variety of emission sources ranging from power plants to lawn mowers and barbecues. The regulation, estimated to cost between 9 and 37 billion annually in 1990 was based partly on a study that suggested that reducing emissions of fine particles could lead to substantial reductions in premature mortality.136 In response to that controversy, Senator Richard Shelby
authored a provision in the 1999 Omnibus Spending Bill that requires data generated under federal awards at universities and non-profit institutions to be available to the public.137 OMB then developed a policy to implement the Shelby
Our recommendation would go further than the Shelby amendment and would require the development of a new policy by OMB.139 As a presumption, all relevant information should be made available to the public regarding the derivation of the likely benefits and costs from
OMB should address this issue through a policy in its guidelines to the agency (or in a separate policy statement). The primary purpose here is to promote transparency in the regulatory process, so the public and interested parties have better access to information that forms the basis for decision
F. Adopt An Annual Regulatory Plan and Retrospective
If OIRA becomes involved in the process only to approve or reject regulations, it will necessarily have a limited role. It would be highly desirable to create a process by which OIRA, and cost-benefit analysis, become relevant at an early stage. President Reagan attempted to move in this direction with his second executive order, which required agencies to produce an annual regulatory President Clinton imposed similar requirements, though little was done with them in practice.143 A special advantage of this approach is that it promises to increase the authority of agency heads over their staffs, simply by ensuring that plans will be visible before the stage when they are practically final.
Our proposal in this regard is simple and straightforward. We would require every agency to produce an account of its planned rules and to forward that account to OIRA, which would in
turn be authorized to work with the agency to require compliance with the principles and requirements of the executive order. By calling for OIRA participation, we hope to ensure more coordination at an early stage than was achieved under Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton.
G. Incorporating Independent Agencies
We have urged that the process of OIRA review should be widened, to include the independent agencies as well as executive agencies and departments. As a matter of policy, the motivation for this suggestion is straightforward. Independent agencies qualify as such not because of the substance of what they do, but because Congress has chosen to limit the President?s power to remove their top officials??saying, in the typical formulation, that removal is acceptable only for ?inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.?144 Many of the most important agencies in government are independent in this sense, including the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
In principle, there is every reason to include independent agencies within the basic structure of an executive order on federal regulation. Indeed, the argument for including such agencies seems no weaker than the argument for including the conventional executive agencies. Moreover, as Table 5 shows, many of these agencies do not routinely quantify the benefits and costs of their proposed regulations, in part because they are not required to do so. If the goal is to ensure more rationality in regulation, and to devote resources to areas where they would do the most good, the independent agencies deserve inclusion no less than others. The real question is one of law, not of policy.
Does the President have the legal authority to do what we propose? Though no President has tested the question, both the Department of Justice146 and the American Bar
have concluded that he does. As a technical matter, the question remains unresolved. In the key case, Humphrey?s Executor v. United States,148 the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional legitimacy of the ?independent? regulatory agencies, but it did not establish what, in particular, ?independence? Nothing in the Court?s opinion resolves the question of whether the President has supervisory authority over the independent agencies. As an initial matter, the question is one of statutory interpretation: What authority has Congress given to the President?
We have noted that the members of independent agencies may be removed by the President, not at his will, but only for ?inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.?150 What do these terms mean? There are two possible approaches. On a narrow interpretation, the President is allowed to discharge independent agency heads only for grounds entirely unrelated to policy disagreements ?-in which case the President may not supervise their policy choices. On this interpretation, the President may discharge people for corruption (?malfeasance in office?), for refusing to do their jobs (?neglect of duty?), or for more general dereliction in the sense of gross incompetence, chronic lateness, and the like (?inefficiency?). On this interpretation, application of the executive order to the independent agencies would indeed raise serious statutory questions. A process by which the President monitors such agencies for corruption and dereliction would be one thing a process by which the President monitors such agencies for what he considers to be sound policy choices would be quite another.
It is also important to take steps to ensure that existing regulations are subject to a process of continuing monitoring and oversight. We do not require any such steps in the proposed order itself, on the ground that they are best imposed by OMB in its general
oversight function. But the key points are that prospective analysis of costs and benefits are often erroneous151 and that unanticipated developments can make regulations obsolete, too stringent, or insufficiently In order to assist OMB in its task of proposing an annual report of the costs and benefits of regulation, agencies should generate numbers reflecting their estimates of the effects of their own most significant regulations. In addition, a process should be instituted by each agency to give a retrospective analysis of some of its most costly regulations, to see what kinds of effects they are having in actual process. OIRA might work together with the relevant agencies to identify the best candidates for review.
On the other hand, a broader interpretation of the statutory terms would hardly be impossible as a textual matter. The first point is that the narrow interpretation has the disadvantage of raising some unresolved constitutional problems. While the Court has upheld the idea of independent regulatory it has never held that Congress can entirely immunize such commissions from presidential oversight. To those who are skeptical of agency independence as a constitutional matter, the narrow interpretation would be extremely troubling and should be avoided if at all possible, so as to avoid a serious constitutional problem. The second point is that the relevant text is susceptible of a broader understanding. What counts as ?inefficiency?? What counts as ?neglect of duty?? At a minimum, it seems sensible to say that the President is entitled to require the production of documents to ensure that agency officials are acting efficiently and in a way that does not show neglect.154 To this extent, procedural incorporation of the independent agencies-?to require them to assess both costs and benefits-?seems to be on firm ground. And it would be reasonable to go further. If agencies proceed when the benefits do not exceed the costs, they might reasonably be thought to be acting ?inefficiently? (pun intended), and in a way that shows a neglect of duty, at least if the decision to proceed is not adequately explained. A broader interpretation does not much stretch the language.
None of this suggests that the President, or OIRA, should be permitted to displace the decisions of the independent regulatory agencies. But it does suggest that a supervisory role, leaving the ultimate decision to those agencies, would be entirely acceptable. To those who are skeptical of this conclusion, it might make sense to create a special, weaker system of oversight for the independent agencies, limited to procedural matters (and hence allowing no room for return letters). But we think that it would be desirable to keep a single system in place for all agencies, retaining the idea that if an independent agency ultimately seeks to issue a regulation notwithstanding OIRA objection, it is entitled to do
If our argument seems far-fetched, consider Bowsher v. In Bowsher, the Court struck down Congress? effort to delegate discretionary authority to the Comptroller General.157 In so doing, the Court held that the Comptroller was unduly subject to congressional control, and thus operated as an agent of Congress, rather than as a genuinely independent agency.158 But what made the Comptroller an agent of Congress? The answer is the governing statute, which allows Congress to discharge the Comptroller for ?inefficiency,? ?neglect of duty,? or But on the narrow view, outlined above, these terms do not allow Congress much in the way of authority over the Comptroller. Rejecting the narrow view, the Court described these terms as ?very broad? and suggested that they meant that Congress ?in effect ... retained control over the execution of the In the Court?s view, these ?very broad [terms] ... could sustain removal of a Comptroller General for any number of actual or perceived transgressions of the legislative will.?161
It would be easy, even natural to take the Bowsher Court?s interpretation of the terms governing congressional removal of the Comptroller General as authority for the proper interpretation of the terms governing presidential removal of the members of independent regulatory commissions. This is so for a simple reason: the terms are very close, indeed essentially identical. If the interpretation in Bowsher is to apply here, then
the President?s authority is also ?very broad? and ?could sustain removal? for a large number of actual or perceived transgressions of the presidential will. And if this is correct, then the President does, in fact, have a high degree of authority over the policy choices of the independent agencies. And if this is correct, then inclusion of the independent agencies within the executive order is plainly lawful, simply as a statutory matter.
We do not contend that this argument is obviously correct. Because the statutory language appears in different contexts, it would be possible to understand the terms in the Comptroller General Act differently from the terms limiting presidential power over the independent regulatory agencies. Our argument would obviously be strengthened if, as we believe, constitutional objections to genuine ?independence? of certain agencies militate against the narrow reading, which would, compared to our reading, restrict presidential control of the In light of this background constitutional concern, the authority of Bowsher, and the ambiguity of the statutory text, we believe that incorporation of the independent agencies would be lawful??a conclusion, we reiterate,163 that has been firmly supported by both the Department of Justice and the American Bar Association.
H. Judicial Review
Under Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton, executive orders on federal regulation were solely for the internal management of the executive branch, and they created no rights for judicial enforcement.164 If, for example, an agency?s regulatory analysis showed that the benefits did not justify the costs, courts were not permitted to consider that fact on judicial review. To be sure, some statutes require attention to both costs and benefits, and when this is so, the agency?s analysis of those factors can be challenged as arbitrary. But the process of analysis under the executive orders, and any disagreements within the executive branch, would not be topics for judicial consideration.
It is not difficult to understand why the executive branch would be skeptical of the idea of judicial intervention. As a general rule, it is not in the interest of the executive branch to increase the authority of the judiciary over executive officers. To be sure, judicial review might solve an agency problem faced by the President if courts could be enlisted to enforce presidential prerogatives against agencies. But the apparent judgment of the executive branch has been that the risks of that course, prominently including losses on appeal, outweigh the advantages.
We have suggested a modest but significant change, slightly compromising the interests of the executive in favor of the interests of the public as a whole. Under our order, judicial review would be available of the materials generated pursuant to the order, but only to the extent that those materials are relevant to the agency?s decision under the relevant statute. This proposal would not violate current law it would merely add to the set of materials that courts examine when testing the question whether the agency has followed the statute or acted arbitrarily. To be sure, this innovation would add materials to the file for judicial review, and in that sense would complicate the judicial task. But it would add little beyond what courts are now considering in the regulatory
IV. What Executive Orders Can and Cannot Do: A Cautionary Note
We believe that a new executive order on federal regulation could do a great deal of good. One reason is the very signal that such an order would send: By virtue of its high visibility, and because of its source (the White House), a new order would suggest a serious commitment, on the part of high-level officials, to improving regulatory outcomes. Another reason is that such an order could embody institutional and substantive reforms that would reduce the problems of shallowness and narrowness. Our central goal has been to ensure that the commitments in previous executive orders are real rather than symbolic, and we believe that the steps suggested here would be helpful in promoting that goal.
An executive order is not, however, a panacea it is not sufficient for real change, and for some purposes it is not even necessary. With respect to the question of necessity, we have noted that OIRA could move in many of the directions we propose under
existing law, including the existing executive order. Indeed, one of our major goals has been to outline the lessons of over two decades of experience with presidential requirements of cost-benefit balancing and to suggest what can be done in response to that experience. If a new executive order does not seem desirable or feasible, we hope that our discussion and our proposed order will have heuristic value, suggesting what should be done even without formal With respect to the insufficiency of a new order, some statutes ban cost-benefit balancing, and the executive must obey the law. A thoroughgoing reform effort would require legislative reforms, not merely executive action. At the executive level itself, everything depends on implementation. It is possible that an executive order, like a Constitution, will be a mere ?parchment with little or no effect on the real world. In fact, successful implementation probably requires high-level political support, in the form, for example, of a clear understanding that the President or the Vice President is committed to the process inaugurated by the executive order. But an executive order would itself be a step toward establishing that understanding.
To make the process truly effective, however, greater congressional support will probably be required. This support will only come if the public sees a need for greater transparency and accountability in the regulatory process. The reality is that most of the public is (usually rationally) uninformed on many regulatory issues, including the issue of regulatory And legislators do not typically have a strong incentive to support regulatory reforms that promote accountability. Indeed, many members of Congress seem to prefer to pass laws and regulations that give the appearance of fixing the problem??leaving it to the executive and the judiciary to sort out Without stronger congressional efforts, any steps from the President will have a limited effect.
V. Conclusion Government regulation continues to display a pattern of ?paranoia and
Understood as a pragmatic tool for drawing attention to the likely effects of regulation, cost-benefit analysis holds out considerable promise for overcoming the underlying problems. For over twenty years, executive orders have attempted to discipline the administrative process by requiring agencies to pay close attention to both costs and benefits. But the overall record is mixed. In many cases, cost-benefit analysis does appear to have improved agency decisions in quite significant ways.171 At the same time, the system for OIRA review has not succeeded in fundamentally redirecting regulation toward areas where it would do the most good.
Of course there are many reasons for this mixed record.172 But part of the reason, we suggest, is that the executive?s commitment to cost-benefit analysis remains both too shallow and too narrow. It is too shallow because too much of the time agencies fail to take the commitment seriously, and the process of OIRA review has not ensured that they will do so. It is too narrow because a large number of agencies are not subject to OIRA review at all. We have suggested a range of possible responses. To overcome shallowness, we have called for mandatory compliance with OMB guidelines on regulatory analysis formalized the ideas of ?return letters? and ?prompt letters ? offered new principles governing substitute risks and trivial risks clarified the issue of equity and distributional effects and authorized limited judicial review of the materials generated through this process. To overcome narrowness, we have included the independent agencies, which issue many of the nation?s most important regulations, within the scope of the order.
As we have discussed, an executive order, standing by itself, will not do all, or even nearly all, of what should be done. A great deal depends on personnel and on a serious commitment, on the part of high-level officials, to regulatory reform. Congressional support is also important. As we have emphasized, such a commitment could accomplish a great deal, building on what we have suggested here, under the
existing executive order and to reduce the reality and appearance of partisanship, there are clear advantages to a situation in which an administration of one party is operating under principles laid down under an administration of another party. But the experience of the last two decades suggests that a revised and improved executive order could attract the support of people with a wide range of political commitments, and inaugurate significant improvements in the system of government regulation.
Appendix A New Executive Order
The American people deserve a regulatory system that protects and improves their health, safety, environment, and well-being without imposing unacceptable or unreasonable costs on society. Regulatory policies should be based on a careful assessment of the likely consequences of regulation, including an effort to assess and balance both costs and benefits. Regulatory policies should use the lowest-cost means of achieving social goals. Public and private resources should be devoted to large problems, not trivial ones. The general objective of this Executive Order is to ensure that cost-benefit analysis, understood as a tool to produce better decisions, will have a far larger role in the federal government than it now does. The particular objectives are: to ensure that regulations are adopted on the basis of an evaluation of their likely consequences to promote sensible priority-setting to increase attention to neglected problems while reducing expenditures on minor or nonexistent problems to ensure that agencies consider alternatives to costly regulation to enhance planning and coordination with respect to both new and existing regulations and to make the process accessible and open to the public. In pursuing these objectives, the regulatory process shall be conducted so as to meet applicable statutory requirements and with due regard to the discretion that has been entrusted to the Federal agencies.
Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. STATEMENT REGULATORY APPROACH REQUIREMENTS
(A) Approach. Federal agencies should promulgate only those regulations that are required by law, are necessary to interpret the law, or are made necessary by compelling public need, such as material failures of private markets to protect or improve the health and safety of the public, the environment, or the well-being of the American people. In deciding whether and how to regulate, agencies shall assess the costs and benefits of reasonable regulatory alternatives, including the alternative of not regulating. Costs and benefits shall be understood to include both quantifiable measures (to the fullest extent that these can be usefully estimated) and qualitative measures of costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify, but nevertheless essential to consider. Agencies should ordinarily
act only if the incremental benefits exceed the incremental costs. Further, in choosing among alternative regulatory approaches, agencies should ordinarily select the approach that maximizes net benefits, unless a statute requires another regulatory approach.
(B) Agency Requirements. To ensure that agency regulations are consistent with the approach set forth above, agencies shall adhere to the following requirements, to the extent permitted by law:
(1) Each agency shall identify the problem that it intends to address as well as assess the significance of that problem.
(2) Each agency shall explain why the problem that it intends to address is not adequately handled by private markets or by state or local authorities.
(3) Each agency shall examine whether existing regulations (or other law) have created, or contributed to, the problem that a new regulation is intended to correct and whether those regulations (or other law) should be modified to achieve the intended goal of regulation more effectively.
(4) Each agency shall identify and assess available alternatives to direct regulation, including providing economic incentives to encourage the desired behavior, such as user fees or marketable permits, or providing information upon which choices can be made by the public.
(5) In setting regulatory priorities, each agency shall attempt to ensure that it addresses serious problems rather than trivial ones and shall consider, to the extent reasonable, the degree and nature of the risks posed by various substances or activities within its jurisdiction.
(6) Each agency shall explore and explain whether any regulation will create significant new risks of any kind, and if so, shall identify the extent of any new risks in qualitative and quantitative terms.
(7) When an agency determines that a regulation is the best available method of achieving the regulatory objective, it shall design its regulation in the most cost-effective manner to achieve that objective.
(8) Each agency shall assess both the incremental costs and benefits of the intended regulation and, recognizing that some costs and benefits are uncertain and difficult to quantify, should generally propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the incremental benefits of the intended regulation exceed its
incremental costs. If an agency determines to proceed even though the quantifiable incremental benefits do not exceed the quantifiable incremental costs, then the agency should explain why it intends to proceed in those circumstances, by, for example, referring to distributional effects as authorized by subsection (15) below.
(9) Each agency shall base its decisions on the best reasonably obtainable scientific, economic, and other information concerning the need for, and consequences of, the intended regulation.
(10) Each agency shall identify and assess reasonable alternative forms of regulation, including at least two reasonable alternatives to the option under consideration, one more stringent and one less stringent.
(11) Each agency shall, to the extent feasible, use performance objectives, rather than specifying the behavior or manner of compliance that regulated entities must adopt.
(12) Wherever feasible, agencies shall seek the views of those most likely to be affected, including appropriate state, local, and tribal officials before imposing regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect those governmental entities. As appropriate, agencies shall seek to reduce unnecessary conflicts between federal regulatory actions and other law and regulation, including that issued by state and local governments.
(13) Each agency shall avoid regulations that are inconsistent, incompatible, or duplicative with/of other regulations or policies.
(14) Each agency shall draft its regulations in language that is simple and easy to understand.
(15) Each agency shall consider, as appropriate, distributional effects, and after undertaking the analysis of costs and benefits, agencies shall be permitted to take account of those distributional effects in deciding whether to proceed. If the costs exceed the benefits by a substantial margin, agencies shall proceed only if the distributional effects are very clear and highly desirable.
An efficient regulatory planning and review process is vital to ensure that the Federal Government?s regulatory system best serves the American people.
SECTION 2. ORGANIZATION
(A) The Office of Management and Budget. Coordinated review of agency rulemaking is necessary to ensure that regulations are consistent with applicable law, the President?s priorities, and the principles set forth in this Executive Order, and that decisions made by one agency do not conflict with the policies or actions taken or planned by another agency. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall carry out that review function. Within OMB, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) is the repository of expertise concerning regulatory issues and should thus take the lead in implementing this Executive order. Where appropriate, OIRA should draw heavily on the expertise of the Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of Science and Technology Policy in developing sound regulatory policy. To the extent permitted by law, OMB shall provide guidance to agencies and assist the President, the Vice President, and other regulatory policy advisors to the President in regulatory planning, and shall be the entity that reviews individual regulations, as provided by this Executive order.
(B) OIRA shall be authorized to review proposed regulations. To carry out this task, OIRA shall issue guidelines governing regulatory impact analyses. These guidelines shall be issued after an appropriate period for comments from affected agencies, the private sector, and any interested persons. When a proposed regulation does not, in OIRA?s view, conform to the principles set out in this Executive Order or to OIRA guidelines for engaging in regulatory analysis, OIRA shall return the regulation to the agency for reconsideration.
(C) OIRA shall be authorized to prompt agencies to undertake actions where the incremental benefits exceed the incremental costs. When OIRA has asked an agency to undertake such action, the agency shall, within 60 days, offer a public account of its intended course of action.
(D) The Vice President. The Vice President is the principal advisor to the President on, and shall coordinate the development and presentation of recommendations concerning, regulatory policy, planning, and review, as set forth in this Executive Order. In fulfilling their responsibilities under this Executive Order, the President and the Vice President may be assisted by the regulatory policy advisors within the Executive Office of the
President and by such agency officials and personnel as the President and the Vice President may, from time to time, consult.
(A) ?Advisors? refers to regulatory policy advisors consulted by the President and Vice President, including, among others: the Director of OMB the Chair (or another member) of the Council of Economic Advisers the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology the Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs the Assistant to the President and Staff Secretary the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff to the Vice President the Assistant to the President and Counsel to the President the Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of the White House Office on Environmental Policy and the Administrator of OIRA, who also shall coordinate communications relating to this Executive order among the agencies, OMB, the other Advisors, and the Office of the Vice President.
(B) ?Agency,? unless otherwise indicated, means any authority of the United States that is an ?agency? under 44 U.S.C. § 3502(1), including those considered to be independent regulatory agencies, as defined in 44 U.S.C. § 3502(10).
(D) ?Regulation? or ?rule? means an agency statement of general applicability and future effect, which the agency intends to have the force and effect of law, that is designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or to describe the procedure or practice requirements of an agency. It does not, however, include:
(1) Regulations or rules that pertain to a military or foreign affairs function of the United States, other than procurement regulations and regulations involving the import or export of non-defense articles and services
(2) Regulations or rules that are limited to agency organization, management, or personnel matters or
SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS For purposes of this Executive order:
(C) ?Director? means the Director of OMB.
(3) Any other category of regulations exempted by public notice of the Administrator of OIRA.
(E) ?Regulatory action? means any substantive action by an agency (normally published in the Federal Register) that promulgates or is expected to lead to the promulgation of a final rule or regulation, including notices of inquiry, advance notices of proposed rulemaking, and notices of proposed rulemaking.
(F) ?Significant regulatory action? means any regulatory action that is likely to result in a rule that may:
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, the environment, public health or safety
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency or
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof.
SECTION 4. CENTRALIZED REVIEW REGULATIONS The guidelines set forth below shall apply to all regulatory actions, for both new and existing regulations, by agencies other than those agencies specifically exempted by public notice of the Administrator of OIRA:
(A) Agency Responsibilities. In addition to adhering to its own rules and procedures and to the requirements of applicable law, each agency shall develop its regulatory actions in a timely fashion and adhere to the following procedures with respect to a regulatory action:
(a) Each agency shall provide OIRA, at such times and in the manner specified by
the Administrator of OIRA, with a list of its planned regulatory actions, indicating
those which the agency believes are subject to review under this Executive order.
Absent a material change in the development of the planned regulatory action, those
not designated as significant will not be subject to review under this section unless,
within 10 working days of receipt of the list, the Administrator of OIRA notifies the
agency that OIRA has determined that a planned regulation is a significant regulatory
action within the meaning of this Executive Order. The Administrator of OIRA may by public notice waive review of any planned regulatory action designated by the agency as significant, in which case the agency need not further comply with subsection (A)(2)(b) or subsection (A)(2)(c) of this section.
(b) For each matter identified as, or determined by the Administrator of OIRA to be, a significant regulatory action, the issuing agency shall provide to OIRA:
(i) The text of the draft regulatory action, together with a reasonably detailed
description of the need for the regulatory action and an explanation of how the
regulatory action will meet that need. The description of need should clearly
identify whether the regulation is designed to address a specific failure in the
functioning of markets and how it addresses that need.
(ii) An assessment of the potential costs and benefits of the regulatory action,
including an explanation of the manner in which the regulatory action is
consistent with a statutory mandate and, to the extent permitted by law,
maximizes net economic benefits.
(c) For those matters identified as, or determined by the Administrator of OIRA to be, a significant regulatory action within the scope of section 3(F)(1), the agency shall also provide to OIRA the following additional information developed as part of the agency?s decision-making process (unless prohibited by law):
(i) An assessment, including the underlying analysis, of benefits anticipated
from the regulatory action together with, to the extent feasible, a quantification of
those benefits.
(ii) An assessment, including the underlying analysis, of costs anticipated
from the regulatory action, together with, to the extent feasible, a quantification of
those costs and
(iii) An assessment, including the underlying analysis, of costs and benefits of
potentially effective and reasonably feasible alternatives to the planned
regulation??including improvements to the current regulation and viable
nonregulatory actions such as information provision??and an explanation why the
planned regulatory action is preferable to the identified potential alternatives.
(d) In emergency situations, or when an agency is obligated by law to act more quickly than normal review procedures allow, the agency shall notify OIRA as soon as possible and, to the extent practicable, comply with subsections (A)(2)(b) and (c) of this section. For those regulatory actions that are governed by a statutory or courtimposed deadline, the agency shall, to the extent practicable, schedule rulemaking proceedings so as to permit sufficient time for OIRA to conduct its review, as set forth below in subsection (B)(2) through (4) of this section.
(e) After the regulatory action has been published in the Federal Register or otherwise issued to the public, the agency shall:
(i) Make available to the public, via the Internet and through other appropriate
means, the information set forth in subsections (A)(2)(B) and (A)(2)(C)
(ii) Identify for the public, in a complete, clear, and simple manner, the
substantive changes between the draft submitted to OIRA for review and the
action subsequently announced and
(iii) Identify for the public those changes in the regulatory action that were
made at the suggestion or recommendation of OIRA.
(B) OIRA Responsibilities. The Administrator of OIRA shall provide meaningful guidance and oversight so that each agency?s regulatory actions are consistent with applicable law, the President?s priorities, and the principles set forth in this Executive Order and do not conflict with the policies or actions of another agency. OIRA shall, to the extent permitted by law, adhere to the following guidelines:
(1) OIRA shall review all actions identified by the agency or by OIRA as significant regulatory actions.
(2) OIRA shall waive review or notify the agency in writing of the results of its review within the following time periods:
(a) For any notices of inquiry, advance notices of proposed rulemaking, or other
preliminary regulatory actions prior to a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, within 10
working days after the date of submission of the draft action to OIRA
(b) For all other regulatory actions, within 90 calendar days after the date of submission of the information required by this Order, unless OIRA has previously reviewed this information and, since that review, there has been no material change in the facts and circumstances upon which the regulatory action is based, in which case, OIRA shall complete its review within 60 days and
(c) The review process may be extended either (1) once by no more than 30 calendar days upon the written approval of the Director or (2) at the request of the agency head.
(3) For each regulatory action that the Administrator of OIRA returns to an agency for further consideration of some or all of its provisions, the Administrator of OIRA shall provide the issuing agency a written explanation for such return, setting forth the pertinent provision of this Executive Order on which OIRA is relying.
(4) For each regulatory action for which the Administrator of OIRA issues a prompt letter, the Administrator of OIRA shall provide the issuing agency a written explanation for such prompt, setting forth the pertinent provision of this Executive Order on which OIRA is relying.
(5) Except as otherwise provided by law or required by a Court, in order to ensure greater openness, accessibility, and accountability in the regulatory review process, OIRA shall be governed by the following disclosure requirements:
(a) All substantive communications between OIRA personnel and persons not
employed by the executive branch of the Federal Government regarding a regulatory
action under review shall be governed by the following guidelines:
(i) A representative from the issuing agency shall be invited to any meeting
between OIRA personnel and such person(s)
(ii) OIRA shall forward to the issuing agency, within 10 working days of
receipt of the communication(s), all written communications, regardless of
format, between OIRA personnel and any person who is not employed by the
executive branch of the Federal Government, and the dates and names of
individuals involved in all substantive oral communications (including meetings
to which an agency representative was invited, but did not attend, and telephone
conversations between OIRA personnel and any such persons) and
(iii) OIRA shall publicly disclose relevant information about such communication(s), as set forth below. (b) OIRA shall maintain a publicly available log that shall contain, at a minimum, the following information pertinent to regulatory actions under review:
(i) The status of all regulatory actions, (ii) A notation of all written
communications forwarded to an issuing agency and
(iii) The dates and names of individuals involved in all substantive oral
communications, including meetings and telephone conversations, between OIRA
personnel and any person not employed by the executive branch of the Federal
Government, and the subject matter discussed during such communications.
(c) After the regulatory action has been published in the Federal Register or otherwise issued to the public, or after the agency has announced its decision not to publish or issue the regulatory action, OIRA shall make available to the public all documents exchanged between OIRA and the agency during the review by OIRA under this section. Provided, that OIRA shall make exceptions to ensure protection of material that is proprietary or otherwise privileged.
SECTION 5: REGULATORY RETROSPECTIVE REGULATORY PLANNING
(A) Each agency shall produce an annual report on the benefits and costs of its significant regulations during the past year. A draft of the annual report shall be submitted to OIRA to ensure an adequate period (in no case less than ninety days) for OIRA review and comment.
(B) Each agency shall produce, by December 31 of each year, a report on its planned activities for the following year (?annual regulatory plan?). OIRA shall be given an opportunity to comment on the annual regulatory plan and to work with the relevant agency to ensure compliance with the requirements and principles in this order.
To the extent permitted by law, disagreements or conflicts between or among agency heads, or between OIRA and any agency, that cannot be resolved by the Administrator of
SECTION 6. RESOLUTION CONFLICTS
OIRA shall be resolved by the President, or by the Vice President acting at the request of the President, with the relevant agency head (and, as appropriate, other interested government officials). Vice Presidential and Presidential consideration of such disagreements may be initiated only by the Director, by the head of the issuing agency, or by the head of an agency that has a significant interest in the regulatory action at issue. Such review will not be undertaken at the request of other persons, entities, or their agents.
Resolution of such conflicts shall be informed by recommendations developed by the Vice President, after consultation with the Advisors (and other executive branch officials or personnel whose responsibilities to the President include the subject matter at issue). The development of these recommendations shall be concluded within 60 days after review has been requested.
At the end of this review process, the President, or the Vice President acting at the request of the President, shall notify the affected agency and the Administrator of OIRA of the President?s decision with respect to the matter.
Except to the extent required by law, an agency shall not publish in the Federal Register or otherwise issue to the public any regulatory action that is subject to review under section 4 of this Executive Order until whichever of the following occurs first:
(1) the Administrator of OIRA notifies the agency that OIRA has waived its review of the action or has completed its review without any requests for further consideration or
(2) the applicable time period expires without OIRA having notified the agency that it is returning the regulatory action for further consideration. If the terms of the preceding sentence have not been satisfied and an agency wants to publish or otherwise issue a regulatory action, the head of that agency may request Presidential consideration through the Vice President, as provided under section 6 of this Order. Upon receipt of this request, the Vice President shall notify OIRA and the Advisors. The guidelines and
SECTION 7. PUBLICATION
time period set forth in this Order shall apply to the publication of regulatory actions for which Presidential consideration has been sought.
SECTION 8. JUDICIAL REVIEW This Executive order is intended to improve the internal management of the Federal Government. Agency analyses generated by this Executive order shall be placed on file for judicial review and, to the extent that those analyses are relevant to the legality of the agency?s conduct, the reviewing court may consider them in assessing the legal issues. This Executive order does not otherwise create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.
