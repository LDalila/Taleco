          <p>The so-called communications revolution has been driven by
technological change. The rise of cable television, the Internet,
satellite television, “direcTV,” and digital television has confounded
ordinary understandings of “television.”1 Before long, digital
television may enable viewers to choose among over a thousand
programs.2 The possible combination of television and the
Internet—a combination now in its early stages—may prove an
equally dramatic development.3</p>
          <p>Law has responded to these developments in fits and starts,
largely by attempting to engraft legal requirements designed for the
old environment onto an altogether new communications market.
The result is a high degree of anachronism, misfit, and drift, and in
the view of many observers, a series of constitutional violations.4

Most of the modern debate involves a vigorous but increasingly tired
contest between those defending the old regulatory order5 and those
urging rapid movement toward “simple rules” for government
control of television, above all well-defined property rights and
freedom of contract.6</p>
          <p>My aim in this Article is to discuss a small but important part of
the intersection between the emerging communications market and
law: public interest obligations imposed on television broadcasters.
Since the initial rise of broadcasting in the United States,
government has treated the license as a kind of “grant” that is
legitimately accompanied by duties.7 Congress and the FCC have
required broadcasters to follow a range of requirements—a form of
old-style “command-and-control” regulation, growing out of an
understanding that there would be three, and only three, private
broadcasting stations. Much, though far from all, of this regulation
was eliminated in the 1980s.8 A large question is the extent to which
public interest requirements continue to make sense, or even to
survive constitutional scrutiny, in an entirely different
communications market.</p>
          <p>The question was posed starkly with the enactment of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996,9 one of whose central concerns
involved the rise of digital television. The Act had to deal with two
issues. First, who would have the right to broadcast digital television?

government, in a way that is easily adapted to the area of communications).</p>

(codified in scattered sections of 47 U.S.C. §§ 151-613 and amending the
Communications Act of 1934).
Should the licenses be sold, or auctioned, or given outright to
existing broadcasters? Second, what public interest obligations—if
any—should attach to the ownership of a right to broadcast digital
television? The Act squarely answered the first question but was
silent on the second. 10 In an extremely controversial step, Congress
did not sell or auction the right to broadcast digital television, but
basically gave the right to existing broadcasters for free.11 This has
sometimes been described as a “$70 billion giveaway.”12 At the same
time, Congress refused to eliminate public interest obligations and
delegated to the FCC the power to decide whether such obligations
should be imposed on digital television broadcasters, and if so in
what form.13 The FCC has not yet made that decision or even
commenced formal proceedings.</p>
      <p>In this Article I offer two basic claims, one involving ends, the
other involving means. The first is that at least in the near term, the
nature of the emerging communications market does not provide a
sufficient reason to abandon the idea that broadcasters should be
required to promote public interest goals. There is a large difference
between the public interest and what interests the public. This is
especially so in light of the still-distinctive character and
consequences of the communications market. One of the central
goals of the system of broadcasting, private as well as public, should
be to promote the American aspiration to deliberative
democracy14—a system in which citizens are informed about public

issues and able to make judgments on the basis of reasons.
Educational programming, and programming that deals with civic
questions, can promote that aspiration; reliance on an unregulated
market may not. There are also legitimate grounds for encouraging
broadcasters to make programming accessible to people with
disabilities, above all the deaf. I emphasize in this connection some
special characteristics of the broadcasting market, characteristics that
make it hazardous to rely on the ideal of “consumer sovereignty” as
the exclusive basis for regulatory policy.</p>
      <p>My second claim is that in order to promote the relevant goals,
government should decreasingly rely on command-and-control
regulation,15 and should turn instead to three less intrusive and more
flexible instruments, each of which is well-adapted to a period of
rapid technological change. The instruments are (1) mandatory
public disclosure of information about public interest broadcasting,
unaccompanied by content regulation; (2) economic incentives,
above all “play or pay”; and (3) voluntary self-regulation, as through a
“code” of appropriate conduct, to be created and operated by the
industry itself. These instruments have played an increasing role in
regulatory policy in general, especially in the environmental arena.16
But they have not been discussed in the area of communications,
where they have a natural place; and despite its growing importance,
the general topic of self-regulation by industry self-regulation has
received little academic attention.17
15 A question not addressed here is the content of any minimal requirements; I
emphasize the more flexible alternatives as the instruments of choice, without
denying the need for some minima as a “backstop.” In the current system, for
example, it may well make sense to require a degree of children’s programming and
also free air time for candidates. See Final Report, supra note *. The precise extent
of mandatory programming is beyond the scope of the present discussion, though I
do refer to mandates at several points below..
16 See generally Neil Cunningham and Peter Grabosky, Smart Regulation:
Designing Environmental Policy 422-48 (1999); Anthony Ogus, Regulation
121149, 245-56 (1998); National Academy of Public Administration, The
Environment Goes To Market 12-55 (1994).
17 The principal exception can be found in an illuminating symposium issue in an
Australian law review, see Symposium, Industry Self-Regulation, 19 Law &amp; Policy
363 (1997).
Through requiring broadcasters to disclose information about
their public interest activities, government may be able to enlist
public pressure and social norms so as to create a kind of competition
to do more and better. This is the simplest and least intrusive of
regulatory instruments. By allowing broadcasters to buy their way
out of certain public interest obligations, government should be able
to ensure that those with an incentive to produce good programming
are actually doing so, and also to produce lowest-cost means of
promoting public interest programming. And through encouraging
(not mandating) voluntary self-regulation, government can help
broadcasters to overcome a kind of prisoner’s dilemma faced by
participants in a “winner-take-all” market,18 a prisoner’s dilemma
that contributes to a range of social problems, often stemming from
a kind of “race to the bottom” with respect to programming quality.</p>
      <p>It should be clear that this basic approach combines an
insistence on the serious limits of unrestrained communications
markets in promoting social goals with a plea for rejecting traditional
regulation and for enlisting more flexible, market-oriented
instruments in the service of those goals. This approach is consistent
with some incipient but quite general trends in regulatory law.19 If
the approach is sound, it is ideally suited to the emerging
communications market; but it is easily adapted to other areas as
well, involving environmental degradation and other social problems.
It is much too soon to say whether there is a “third way” between
traditional command-and-control regulation and reliance on free
trade and well-defined property rights. But if there is indeed a “third
way,” it is likely to be found in proposals of this kind.</p>
      <p>Thus the most general theme of this Article is that disclosure,
economic incentives, and voluntary self-regulation might displace
government command-and-control in a variety of areas of regulatory
law. More specific themes involve the value of requiring producers to

189209 (1995).
19 See, e.g., Neil Gunningham and Peter Grabosky, Smart Regulation: Designing
Environmental Policy 37-92 (1999); National Academy of Public Administration,
The Environment Goes To Market (1994); Cass R. Sunstein, Informational
Regulation and Informational Standing,: Akins and Beyond, 147 U. Pa. L. Rev.
613, 618-33 (1999).
disclose goods and bads, independent of any regulatory
requirements; of relaxing the antitrust laws so as to permit
cooperation designed to reduce some of problems associated with
both “winner-take-all” markets and “races to the bottom”; of
distinguishing between market-suppressing and
marketsupplementing remedies; of building on emerging developments in
environmental protection so as to allow far more imaginative “trades”
among producers of social goods and bads; and of greatly expanding
the repertoire of regulatory tools to be used by officials concerned
with market failures (or market successes that disserve social goals).
In short, it is time to move beyond the view that market ordering
and content regulation are the two possibilities for communications
law. There are many alternatives, and real progress can come only
from exploring the choice among them.</p>
      <p>The Article comes in eight parts. Part II sets the stage, outlining
the history of regulation and identifying some relevant puzzles. Part
III evaluates, and rejects, the claim that in the emerging television
market, there is no longer room for public interest regulation of any
kind. I suggest that broadcasting is no ordinary commodity, partly
because of the collective benefits of good programming, and partly
because viewers are more like products, offered to advertisers, than
consumers paying for entertainment on their own. I also trace likely
stages of the emerging market, with broadcast programming
becoming more and more like general-interest magazines. Part IV
deals with disclosure, exploring the possibility that relevant private
groups, invoking widespread social norms, can interact to produce
improvements in the broadcasting market without compulsory
programming of any kind. Part V deals with economic incentives,
beginning with the idea of “pay or play,” and then adapting some
ideas in the law of tort to the law of broadcasting. Part VI examines
whether a code of broadcasting might operate as kind of positional
arms control agreement, helping to counteract a situation in which
broadcasters compete to the detriment of collective goals. Part VII is
a brief summary of regulatory options. Part VIII provides a
conclusion.</p>

          <title>A. A Brief Historical Overview20</title>
          <p>Broadcast licenses have never been treated like ordinary property
rights, open for sale on the free market. Since the initial enactment
of the Communications Act of 1934, the government has awarded
licenses to broadcasters in accordance with the “public interest,
convenience, and necessity.”21 The Federal Radio Commission early
described the system as one in which broadcasters “must be operated
as if owned by the public. . . . It is as if a community should own a
station and turn it over to the best man in sight with this injunction:
‘Manage this station in our interest . . . .”22 Under this “public
trustee” standard, the FCC has imposed a range of obligations on
broadcasters.</p>
          <p>In its initial set of guidelines, the FCC required stations to meet
the “tastes, needs and desires of all substantial groups among the
listening public.”23 This required “a well-rounded program, in which
entertainment, consisting of music of both classical and lighter
grades, religion, education and instruction, important public events,
discussions of public questions, weather, market reports, and news,
and matters of interest to all members of the family, find a place.”24</p>
          <p>Often this kind of guidance operated as a general plea, with
little systematic enforcement. In 1960, however, the FCC went so
far as to outline fourteen of the “major elements usually necessary to
the public interest.”25 These included religious programming;
program for children; political broadcasts; news programs; sports
programs; weather and market services, and development and use of

local talent. The FCC eventually specified its general guidelines,
which were intended merely as “indicia of the types and areas of”
appropriate service. The specifications included minimum amounts
for news, public affairs, and other non-entertainment programming,
including the controversial “fairness doctrine,” and also access rules
for prime-time.26 Broadcasters were required to limit advertising
time, maintain program logs, and ascertain local community needs.27</p>
          <p>Substantial changes occurred in the 1980s, a period of
significant deregulation. The head of the FCC, Mark Fowler,
declared that television is “just another appliance,” a “toaster with
pictures.”28 The fairness doctrine was largely eliminated, and many
of the more particular public interest requirements were removed.29
Nonetheless, a number of such requirements remain. For example,
the FCC continues to say that if a broadcaster sells airtime to one
candidate, it must sell similar time to opposing candidates as well.
Congress itself has codified a right of this kind.30 A longstanding
statutory provision requires that if a broadcaster offers to sell time, it
must do so at the “lowest unit rate of the station” during the 45 days
before a primary election and during the 60 days before a general or
special election.31</p>

programming and to deaf people’s access to television. In 1990,

Congress enacted the Children’s Programming Act of 1990,32 which
requires broadcasters to provide three hours of educational
programming per week, and which also limits the advertising on
children’s programming (12 minutes per hour during weekdays and
10/5 minutes per weekends).33 A statute enacted in 1990 requires
new television sets to have special decoder chips, allowing them to
display closed captioned television transmissions.34 T h e
Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires use of “v-chip”
technology, designed to facilitate parental control over what enters
the home; it also contains ancillary requirements intended to ensure
“ratings” of programming content.35</p>

          <p>Turn now to the present, or at least to the recent past. From 1997
to 1998, a presidential advisory committee met to discuss the public
interest obligation of television broadcasters.36 Several of the
broadcasters on the Committee were quite skeptical about
governmental mandates, but highly receptive to the idea of adopting
some kind of broadcasting “code,” akin to the kind approved and
administered by the National Association of Broadcasters between
1928 and 1979. The Committee eventually moved toward endorsing
the notion of a code, and the idea received considerable attention,
mid-deliberations, in the trade press.</p>
          <p>In its annual meeting, however, the National Association of
Broadcasters signaled its skepticism about the idea and came very
close to saying “no” and “never.” Very oddly, a large part of the
broadcasters’ objection was that any “code” would violate the
antitrust laws. This is very odd, because in their discussions,
members of the NAB treated the possibility of an antitrust violation
as extremely good news. It is not often that high-level corporate

Public Interest Obligations of Digital Television Broadcasters.
officials are smiling when they discuss the possibility that certain
action would be found unlawful.</p>
          <p>Consider a second puzzle. During the committee’s deliberations,
some people argued on behalf of a “pay or play” system, in which
broadcasters would be relieved of public interest obligations (to
“pay”) if they agree instead to pay someone else—another
broadcaster—to do so. But many of the broadcasters on the
committee were quite skeptical of this approach, arguing that public
interest obligations were part of the duty of every broadcaster, and
that no one should be exempted for a price. This was also very odd.
It is not often that high-level corporate officials prefer rigid
government mandates to more flexible approaches. What explains
these puzzles?</p>

        <sec id="sec-4-1-3">
          <title>C. Identifying the Problem</title>
          <p>To evaluate particular proposals, it is necessary to have a
concrete sense of why some people think that even well-functioning
television markets are inadequate. Consider the following
possibilities, each of which has produced public concern in the last
decade37:
1. There may be insufficient educational programming for
children. The existing fare may be insufficient because there is
too little simply in terms of amount, or because children do not
watch the stations on which it is available, or because the
quality is too low.
2. Some programming may be affirmatively bad for children if,
for example, it contains excessive violence, or otherwise
encourages behavior that is dangerous to self and others. The
result of such programming may be to produce violent or
otherwise dangerous behavior in the real world.38
37 For different angles, see, e.g., Final Report, supra note; Hamilton, supra note,
at 3-50 (discussing violence); Newton Minow and Craig LaMay, Abandoned in
the Wasteland: Children, Television, and the First Amendment 10-45 (1995)
(discussing children) Danny Schechter, The More You Watch, The Less You
Know (1997) (discussing content of news).
38 See Hamilton, supra, at 20-30, for evidence.
3. Programming may not be sufficiently accessible to people
who are deaf or hard of hearing; this may be a particular
problem if citizens are unable to find out about emergencies.39
4. There may be too little coverage of serious issues, especially
during political campaigns. The relevant coverage may involve
sensationalism and “sound bites,” or attention to who is ahead
(“horserace issues”) rather than who thinks what and why. The
result may be an insufficiently informed citizenry.40
5. There may be too much violent programming in general,
with adverse consequences for adults, not only children.41 The
adverse consequences may include an increase in violence
(because of changes in social norms or “copycat” effects42),
general demoralization and fear, or a misperception of reality.
6. News coverage may be a form of “infotainment,” dealing not
with real issues, but with gossip about celebrities and charges of
various kinds.43
7. At least on the major networks, programming may be too
homogenous, in a form of “blind leading the blind”
programming. Since a significant percentage of Americans do
not receive cable television, and depend on broadcasters, the
result may be insufficient variety in programming.44
8. There may be too little substantive diversity of view—too
little debate among people with genuinely different

perspectives about issues of policy and fact. Here too, the result
may be an insufficiently informed citizenry.45
9. The problem may be not homogeneity but heterogeneity,
which may result in a highly balkanized viewing public, in
which many or most people lack shared viewing experiences, or
in which people view programming that largely reinforces their
own convictions and prejudices.
10. It may be too expensive for candidates to reach the
electorate via television. The result may be excessive
competition to accumulate funds simply in order to have access
to television; this competition may have corrosive effects on the
electoral process. Free air time would be a possible response,
perhaps qualified by an obligation, on the part of the candidate,
to speak for at least 50% of the time, or to refrain from negative
campaigning.</p>
          <p>To be sure, some of these problems cannot be corrected through
regulation that is either feasible or constitutional. Moreover, these
various conceptions of the relevant problem point toward diverse
solutions, some of which would raise serious first amendment
problems, as discussed below.46 A particular challenge is to develop
approaches that would allow a high degree of flexibility, minimize
government involvement in programming content, and also do some
good.</p>

        <title>III. Preferences and Audiences</title>
        <p>It has increasingly been urged that any objections to existing
television are elitist or outmoded.47 On one view, public interest
obligations have no place in modern law, particularly in light of the

decline of the “scarcity” rationale for regulation; it has even been
urged that the FCC no longer has any appropriate role.48</p>
        <p>A conceptual point first: Though many people claim to argue
for “deregulation,” that route is not in fact an option, or at least not a
reasonable one. What “deregulation” really means is a shift from the
status quo to a system of different but emphatically legal regulation,
more specifically one of property and contract rights, in which
government does not impose specific public interest obligations but
instead sets up initial entitlements and then permits trades among
owners and producers. This is a regulatory system as much as any
other. If it seems close to the current system for newspapers and
magazines, it is no less a regulatory system for that; a great deal of
law (inevitably) governs the rights and duties of newspapers and
magazines. The only real form of deregulation is anarchy, and that is
not an option. The issue is thus not whether to “deregulate,” but
whether one or another regulatory system is better than imaginable
alternatives.</p>
        <p>I therefore turn to the general question whether there remains
any reason for government to regulate broadcasting in the “public
interest.” My concern here is both theoretical and empirical. The
question is whether in the current market, broadcasters are likely to
provide viewers what they would like to see, and if so whether that
point is decisive on the question whether public interest obligations
should be imposed.49 The brief answer is that the idea that
broadcasters show “what viewers want” is a quite inadequate
response to the argument for public interest obligations.50 The
discussion deals with the technological present and the short-term
future; below I introduce complications from emerging technological
developments.

49 An excellent discussion, on which I draw at several points here, is C. Edwin
Baker, Giving the Audience What It Wants, 58 Ohio St. L.J. 311 (1997).
50 The following points are directed to the television market at the close of the
twentieth century and the opening of the twenty-first; later I discuss how they
bear on the market that is likely to emerge thereafter.</p>
        <sec id="sec-4-2-1">
          <title>A. Three Market Failures51</title>
          <p>A well-functioning television market would promote the ideal of
consumer sovereignty. People would be able to choose from a range
of options, and suppliers would cater to their tastes. To a
considerable extent, of course, the existing system approaches this
reality. But there are three serious problems, each suggesting that
consumer sovereignty is not served by free markets in programming.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-4-2-2">
          <title>1. Eyeballs as the commodity</title>
          <p>The first point is the most fundamental. Television is not an
ordinary product, for broadcasters do not sell programming to
viewers in return for cash. A system of “pay-per-view” would indeed
fit the usual commodity model; but “pay per view” continues to be a
rare practice. The difference between the existing broadcasting
market and pay-per-view is quite important. The key problem here
is that viewers do not pay a price, market or otherwise, for television.
On the contrary, it is more accurate to say that viewers are a
commodity, or a product, that broadcasters deliver to the people who
actually pay them: advertisers.52</p>
          <p>This phenomenon introduces some serious distortions, at least if
we understand an ideal broadcasting market as one in which viewers
receive want they want. From the standpoint of consumer
sovereignty, and taking viewers as consumers, the role of advertisers
creates market failures. Of course broadcasters seek, other things
being equal, to deliver more rather than fewer viewers, because
advertisers seek, other things being equal, more rather than fewer
viewers. To this extent the broadcasting market may well provide
many or most viewers with what they “want.” But advertisers have
issues and agendas of their own, and the interests of advertisers can
push broadcasters in, or away from, directions that viewers, or
substantial numbers of them, would actually like.</p>
          <p>This is a substantial difference from the ordinary marketplace.
Thus advertisers like certain demographic groups and dislike others,
even when the numbers are equal; they pay extra amounts in order to
51 These are market failures if it is assumed that the purpose of a well-functioning
television market is to ensure that programming is well-matched to viewer
preferences.
52 See C. Edwin Baker, Advertising and A Democratic Press 25-87 (1994).
attract groups that are likely to purchase the relevant products, and
this affects programming content.53 Advertisers do not want
programming that draws product safety into question, at least not if
it is their own products, and sometimes more generally.54 In
addition, advertisers want programming that will put viewers in a
receptive purchasing mood, and hence not be too “depressing.”55
Advertisers also tend to dislike programming that is highly
controversial or that is too serious, and hence avoid sponsoring
shows that take stands on public issues.56 In these ways, the fact that
broadcasters are delivering viewers to advertisers—this is largely their
charge, under existing arrangements—can produce offerings that
diverge considerably from what would emerge if viewers were paying
directly for programming. To this extent the notion of consumer
sovereignty is seriously compromised.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-4-2-3">
          <title>2. Informational cascades and broadcaster homogeneity</title>
          <p>A second problem is that it is not clear whether broadcasters are
now engaged, in anything like a systematic or scientific way, in
catering to public tastes. At first glance it would seem obvious that
broadcasters must be engaged in this endeavor (subject to the
qualification just stated); if broadcasters are maximizing anything,
they must be maximizing viewers. Attracting viewers is their job.57
But there is reason to question this judgment, at least in its simplest
form. Sometimes rational people make decisions not on the basis of a
full inspection of the alternatives, but on the basis of an
understanding of what other people are doing.58 Because people
obtain information from other people’s actions, individual actions
carry with them one or more “informational externalities,” which
potentially affect the decisions of others. Thus rational and
boundedly rational people, in business as elsewhere, rely on the

signals provided by the words and deeds of others.59 The result can
be to produce cascade effects, as B follows A, and C follows A and
B, and D, as a rational agent, follows the collected wisdom embodied
in the actions of A, B, and C. Informational cascades can produce
unfortunate outcomes, in fact outcomes far worse than those that
would result if individuals accumulated information on their own.
Sometimes, moreover, people use the “availability” heuristic, by
which an event is measured as more probable if an instance of its
occurrence can be brought to mind.60 Using the availability heuristic,
broadcasters might reason that if one show or another has attracted
substantial viewers in the past, they should copy it. The result would
be “fads” and “fashions” in programming.61</p>
          <p>In theory, then, broadcasters might be building on the
programming judgments of other broadcasters, often, perhaps,
reacting to the “availability” of salient recent instances in which a
particular program was especially popular (dealing, let us suppose,
with the O.J. Simpson trial) or especially unpopular (dealing, let us
suppose, with South Africa). If this is true, private decisions by

homogeneity—mistakes in the form of programming unlike what
viewers want, and homogeneity in the form of the “blind leading the
blind.”62</p>
          <p>Recent evidence suggests that the theoretical account has
considerable truth. A careful study shows that there is a good deal of
simple imitation, as networks provide a certain kind of programming
simply by imitating whatever other networks are doing.63 Recently

popular shows tend to create cascade effects. This imitative behavior
is not in the interest of viewers. On the contrary, it creates a kind of
homogeneity and uniformity in the broadcasting market, and thus
makes for problems in terms of providing what viewers “want.”64
This is not a conventional market failure, but it suggests that existing
decisions are unlikely to promote consumer sovereignty.</p>

        <sec id="sec-4-2-4">
          <title>3. Externalities and collective action problems</title>
          <p>Even if broadcasters did provide each viewer with what he or
she wanted, a significant problem would remain, and from the
economic point of view, this is probably the most serious of all.
Information is a public good, and once one person knows something
(about, for example, product hazards, asthma, official misconduct,
welfare reform, or abuse of power), the benefits of that knowledge
will probably accrue to others.65 Note in this regard Amartya Sen’s
remarkable finding that no famine has ever occurred in a democratic
party with a free press.66 This finding is complemented by a series of
less dramatic ones, showing the substantial benefits for individual
citizens of a media that is willing and able to devote attention to
public concerns, including the plight of the disadvantaged.67 But
individual choices by individual viewers may well produce too little
public interest programming in light of the fact that the benefits of
viewing such programming are not fully “internalized” by individual
viewers. Thus individually rational decisions may inflict costs on
others at the same time that they fail to confer benefits on others. In
this respect, the problem “is not that people choose unwisely as
individuals, but that the collective consequences of their choices
often turn out to be very different from what they desire or
anticipate.”68</p>
          <p>Most generally, there are multiple external effects in the
broadcasting area; some of these are positive, but unlikely to be

generated sufficiently by individual choices, while others are
negative, and likely to be excessively produced by individual choices.
Consider a decision to watch violent programming.69 In short, the
effects of broadcasting depend on social interactions, and
broadcasting produces a range of collective goods and collective bads.
Many of the resulting problems are connected with democratic
ideals. Thus, for example, a culture in which each person sees a high
degree of serious programming may well lead to better political
judgments; media portrayals of violence can produce harm to others;
greater knowledge on the part of one person often leads to more
knowledge on the part of others with whom she interacts.70 Perhaps
most important, a degree of serious attention to public issues can
lead to improved governance through deterring abuses and
encouraging governmental response to serious problems. In these
various ways, public interest programming can produce social
benefits that will not be adequately captured by the individual
choices of individual citizens; the same is true for programming that
produces social costs, including increased criminal activity.71</p>

Perhaps television is not best understood as an ordinary commodity,
subject to the forces of supply and demand. There are several reasons
why this might be so. The unifying theme is that the American
political tradition is committed to the ideal of deliberative
democracy,73 an ideal that has animated first amendment doctrine
and media regulation in general.74 Even if the media market were
well-functioning from the economic point of view, there would be
room for measures designed to promote a well-functioning system of

undesirable cartelization or instead as protection against an
undesirable “race to the bottom.” I suggest that a code might do a
great deal of good, partly because of the likely existence of external
monitors, partly because of a code’s capacity to help develop a kind
of internal morality likely to affect many of its signatories. A general
lesson is that the antitrust laws ought not to be invoked too readily
to prevent producers from undertaking cooperative action in
circumstances in which competition is producing palpable social
harms. In such contexts, a “code” can provide some of advantages of
government regulation, but do so in a more flexible and
betterinformed fashion. Thus it is hazardous to invoke the antitrust laws to
prevent an industry to provide the kinds of benefits that might be
provided, more crudely and expensively, by direct regulation.142</p>

          <title>A. The Problem and A Recently Emerging Strategy</title>
          <p>Notwithstanding the qualifications described above, competitive
pressures often can do a great deal in providing programming that
people would like to see. In an era of cable television, and an
increasingly large range of options, competitive pressures will be
especially in producing “niche” programming for people who have a
particular interest in serious programming. The communications
market increasingly resembles the market for magazines; recall the
possibility, in a digital market, of over one thousand stations. But
those competitive pressures also have a downside. They can lead to
sensationalistic, prurient, or violent programming, and to a failure to
provide sufficient attention to educational values, or to the kind of
programming that is indispensable to a well-functioning
democracy.143 This is so especially in light of the fact that a small
relative advantage can led to huge increases in viewers, a fact that
presses television in tabloid-like directions. As Robert Frank and
Philip Cook have suggested, “[I]ncreasingly impoverished political
debate is yet another cost of our current cultural trajectory. Complex
modern societies generate complex economic and social problems,
and the task of choosing the best course is difficult under the best of

circumstances. And yet, as in-depth analysis and commentary give
way to sound bites in which rival journalists and politicians
mercilessly ravage one another, we become an increasingly
illinformed and ill-tempered electorate.”144</p>
          <p>It would be possible to respond to the harmful effects of
competitive pressures in various ways. Probably the simplest response
would take the form of voluntary self-regulation, through some kind
of “code” of good programming; this approach is specifically
designed to respond to the problems that can be introduced by
market pressures. In various nations, including the United States,
cooperative action has played a constructive role in situations of this
kind.145 Though it has yet to receive much academic commentary,146
voluntary self-regulation via industry agreements is emerging as a
regulatory strategy of choice, especially in the environmental
arena.147 The EPA, for example, has encouraged companies that
produce pesticides to agree on pesticide reduction strategies, and
here the fact of broad agreement is crucial.148 California has
attempted to deal with the problem of workplace accidents via a
“cooperative compliance program” involving self-enforced safety
plans on large construction projects. The result has been to produce
significant drops in accident rates.149 Self-regulating agreements are
now in place in Canada’s system for forest management; in the
Responsible Care program of the chemical industry, now operating
in more than forty countries; in national regulation of nuclear power
plants.150

145 See the discussion of ethical code in Israel in Moshe Negbi, The Enemy
Within 14 (Joan Shorenstein Center, Harvard University, Discussion paper

quality, in a kind of cooperative action designed to reduce adverse effects of
market pressures.

          <p>What accounts for the increasing popularity of industry
selfregulation, as part of the general project of “reinventing
government”151? From the industry’s standpoint, self-regulation
allows far more flexibility than government mandates. From the
standpoint of government itself, a special advantage of codes is that
they avoid the kind of informational overload that comes from
government prescriptions; it is partly for this reason that voluntary
agreements among companies have had good effects in the area of
occupational safety and health.152 In a point of special relevance to
television, codes also have been found to have the “ability to
influence community attitudes,” in a way that tends to contribute to
the “development of a custodial ethic.”153 Thus codes have helped to
develop “an effective institutional morality that brings the behavior
of industry members within a normative framework.”154</p>
          <p>Such cooperative action often makes people concerned about
antitrust violations and self-interested profit-seeking under a
publicspirited guise. This is of course a risk, but the antitrust law can go
wrong when it prevents certain cooperative action that overcomes
palpably adverse effects of market pressures. Indeed, the
International Standards Organization is designed specifically to
ensure a form of cooperation designed to overcome those adverse
effects155; the question is whether that experience has
communications analogues.

          <title>1. Origins and precursors: The spectrum and Roosevelt</title>
          <p>The idea of a broadcasting “code” has a long history. The NAB
was founded in 1923, and it first attempted to produce a degree of
self-regulation in 1926, as a response to the “chaos” widely perceived
to have been produced by interference and piracy. Some progress was
made, but ultimately the agreement broke down; hence legislation
was necessary, in the form of the Radio Act of 1927.</p>
          <p>The initial NAB code was produced in 1928. It included some
content guidance, but it was quite vague and also lacked an
enforcement mechanism. Just one year later the NAB adopted a new
code, involving ethics and standards of commercial practice. For
example, the code banned “fraudulent, deceptive or obscene”
material, “false, deceptive, or grossly exaggerated advertising claims,
and “offensive” material. But the continuing imprecision of this
union rights, discrimination, discipline, working hours, and pay. . . . As the name
SA8000 suggests, it is the first to be modelled on existing and widely accepted
commercial standards such as IS09000, drawn up by the International Standards
Organization in Geneva, which is used to determine whether companies have the
management systems to meet required product quality. But the real strength of
the new approach is commercial sanctions. A company which adopts the code
also agrees to be independently inspected to see whether it is abiding by the
conditions laid down. It will be able to attract customers and gain a competitive
advantage by advertising the fact that its factories and suppliers meet the
standard.”

code, together with the lack of an effective enforcement mechanism,
made it something of limited usefulness.</p>
          <p>The next major step resulted from President Roosevelt’s
National Recovery Administrative Codes in 1933. The NAB
submitted a code of fair practices to the NRA, and on November 27,
1933, President Roosevelt signed it and gave it the force of law. The
result included a seven-person Broadcaster Code Authority,
designed to supervise compliance. But the National Recovery Act
was struck down in 1935 by the Supreme Court, and the Code
Authority was eliminated along with the “law” that President
Roosevelt had signed.</p>

          <title>2. After the New Deal, and increased content control</title>
          <p>Soon thereafter the NAB produced a new voluntary code, which
was largely ignored. But in 1938 the NAB produced another, more
specific code and also an explicit enforcement authority, the NAB
Code Committee. Part of the reason for the new development was
the increasing willingness of the FCC to regulate both structure and
content—and a specific warning, by the Chairman of the FCC (after
the broadcast of War of the Worlds) that without industry
selfpolicing, government involvement was likely.</p>
          <p>The 1938 code included a number of important provisions.
Among other things, it (a) required broadcasters to allot time fairly
for discussion of controversial views; (b) banned the sale of time for
the airing of controversial views; (c) asked broadcasters to cooperate
with educational groups for the airing of educational programming;
(d) required fair and accurate news programs; and (e) regulated
commercials by limiting the time and length of advertisements.
There were also prohibitions on hard liquor advertising. A code
committee would enforce the Code by determining whether a station
was in compliance. Notably, the head of the FCC publicly approved
the code, and the American Civil Liberties Union described it as “a
great step forward in formulating a policy in the public interest.”</p>

          <title>3. Television.</title>
          <p>All of these steps involved radio, but the 1938 code was the
unmistakable precursor of the eventual television code. In its first
period, television witnessed a pattern that generally characterized the
past debates over radio and late twentieth century debates over
television: legislative concern, proposed legislation, steps toward
selfregulation, and little or no legislation or regulation.</p>
          <p>In 1951, members of Congress proposed a National Citizens
Advisory Board for Radio and Television, to oversee programming
content. At about the same time the NAB began to draft its first
television code in 1952, apparently in direct response to a
congressional threat of legislation.158 The new code had a broad
reach, emphasizing in particular educational and cultural
programming. It also contained content restrictions on display of
violent action and sexual material.</p>
          <p>Compliance with the Code was voluntary. (Note also that
station operators who were not members of the NAB were eligible to
subscribe.) Its enforcement provisions were quite modest. The basic
mechanism came in the form of a clearinghouse for complaints. In
addition, subscribers could display a code seal (the NAB “Seal of
Good Practice”), and permission to display the seal would be
withdrawn for “continuing, willful, or gross” violations. Thus the
only formal sanction was that the noncomplying station owner could
not display the seal. But there were informal pressures too. Stations
who sought license renewal were likely to have prompt FCC
processing if they adhered to the code. Moreover, some people
believe that subscription to the Code was appealing to those who
bought advertising time, because the Code contained limits on the
length and frequency of commercials, which would enhance the
prominence of the announcement. Some stations in the United
States did not adhere to the Code, but the vast majority chose to do
so.</p>

          <title>4. Family viewing</title>
          <p>In 1962, the FCC proposed to make parts of the code into a
legal mandate. The industry successfully resisted this step. But there
was a continuing pattern of interaction among regulatory proposals,
legislative reaction, public concern, and self-regulation. Of these the
most important involved 1970s concerns about violence on
television. The industry responded through the “family viewing
policy,” saying that inappropriate entertainment programming would

First Amendment, 27 Stan. L. Rev. 1527, 1529 (1975).
not be shown between 7 pm and 9 pm eastern standard time. This
was a distinctive form of self-regulation. But the Writers Guild of
America challenged the policy on first amendment grounds (see
below), arguing that the policy was not voluntary self-regulation but
was in fact a produce of government coercion.</p>
          <p>In a controversial decision, the trial court accepted the
challenge, and barred the NAB from enforcing the policy.159 The
court of appeals overturned the decision on the ground that the
district court was not the right forum to resolve these issues in the
first instance.160 The court of appeals said that the issue should first
be resolved by the FCC. Although the decision of the court of
appeals was jurisdictional, that court suggested considerable doubt
about the district court’s judgment: “It simply is not true that the
First Amendment bars all limitations of the power of the individual
licensee to determine what he will transmit to the listening and
viewing public.” 161</p>
          <p>The FCC ruled in 1983 that there had been no government
coercion and that the NAB had adopted the family viewing policy
voluntarily. In its key passage the FCC wrote, “[v]oluntary industry
action is often preferable to governmental solutions, and an industry
frequently addresses a problem in order to forestall regulation by the
Government; conversely, it is not unusual for a regulatory body to
forego enacting rules when the regulated industry voluntarily adopts
standards which deal with a perceived problem.”162 In June 1979,
however, the Justice Department filed the antitrust suit described in
detail below, resulting in the demise of the television code.</p>
          <p>In the 1980s, continuing congressional concern about televised
violence led to a new law exempting from the antitrust law networks,
broadcasters, cable operators and programmers, and trade
association, in order to permit them to generate standards to reduce

doubt about whether an explicit exemption was necessary; a 1993
opinion from the Department of Justice said that the industry could
cooperate to reduce television violence without offense to the law of
antitrust.164</p>
          <p>In June 1990 the NAB issued new, quite tepid “voluntary
programming principles” to cover violence, indecency and obscenity,
drugs and substance abuse, and violence. The new standards were
reaffirmed in June 1991, and in 1992, ABC, NBC, and CBS issued
and agreed to adhere to a set of new standards, although without an
enforcement mechanism. Thus in the 1990s self-regulation can be
found in various places: the advance parental advisory system, joint
advisory guidelines issued by the four networks, NAB principles, and
an annual public assessment, by the four networks, of television
violence.</p>

          <title>C. A Code: Sample Provisions</title>
          <p>The question is whether it might be possible to adopt a new
code for broadcasting, specifically designed for the new
communications market. Such a code might update the old NAB
code, and help overcome current problems, without having the
degree of tepidness of the existing “standards.” A code might even
promote some of the goals associated with deliberative democracy.</p>
          <p>What provisions might a new code include? An important
question involves appropriate specificity; quite clear provisions
(“three hours of educational programming per week”) risk excessive
rigidity, whereas vague provisions (“reasonable efforts to provide
educational programming per children”) risk meaninglessness.
Discussions of code-making in general have stressed the need for
“the public announcement of the principles and practices that the
industry presumptively accepts as a guide to appropriate conduct and
also as a basis fo evaluating and criticizing performance.”165 This
point argues in favor of a degree of specificity.
163 See 47 U.S.C. § 303(c).
164 See Letter from Sheila Anthony, Assistant Attorney General for Legislative
Affairs, U.S. Department of Justice, to Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) (Nov. 29, 1993).
165 See Gunningham and Rees, supra, at 383.</p>
          <p>Consider the following possible code provisions,166 simply for
the sake of illustration:
1. Each broadcaster shall provide three hours of free air time
for candidates during the two month period preceding the
election. In return for free air time, candidates shall discuss
substantive issues in a substantive way, and must provide
something other than short “soundbites.”
2. Each broadcaster shall provide one hour of educational
programming for children each day. Broadcasters shall attempt
to ensure that children are not exposed to excessively violent
programming or programming that is otherwise harmful to or
inappropriate for children. Broadcasters shall avoid
programming that encourages criminal or self-destructive
behavior; they should also be sensitive in presenting sexual
material that children might encounter.
3. News coverage shall be substantive and issue-oriented. It
should not emphasize the sensational and the prurient. It
should concern itself with claims and disagreements on matters
of substance. Consistent with the exercise of legitimate station
discretion, stations should not give excessive or undue attention
to sensational accusations or to issues of “who is ahead,” at the
expense of other issues.
4. Morbid, sensationalistic or alarming details not essential to a
factual report, especially in connection with stories of crime or
sex, should be avoided. News should be broadcast in such a
manner as to avoid panic and unnecessary alarm. News
programming should attempt to avoid prurience,
sensationalism, and gossip. Stations should make an effort to
166 These provisions are adapted but substantially revised from the more detailed
Code suggested by the Report of the Advisory Committee, supra note. I believe
that the provisions described there are too vague and tepid to be useful; for
reasons discussed in the text, vague and tepid provisons create a high probability
of futility and ineffectiveness.
devote enough time to public issues to permit genuine
understanding of problems and disagreements.
5. Violence, psychological but especially physical, should be
portrayed responsibly, and not exploitatively. Presentation of
violence should avoid the excessive, the gratuitous, the
humiliating, and the instructional. The use of violence for its
own sake and the detailed dwelling upon brutality or physical
agony, by sight or sound, should be avoided. Programs
involving violence should venture to present the consequences
to its victims and perpetrators. Particular care should be
exercised where children may see, or are involved in, the
depiction of violent behavior.. Programs should not present
rape, sexual assault, or sexual violence in an attractive or
exploitative light.
6. Broadcasters shall ensure that their programming is
responsive to the needs of citizens with disabilities. To this
end, broadcasters shall ensure that programming is accessible,
through the provision of closed captioning and other means, to
the extent that doing so does not impose an undue burden on
the broadcaster. Particular efforts should be made to provide
full access to news and public affairs programming. Citizens
who are deaf and hard of hearing are sometimes at risk of a
form of disenfranchisement., or even physical danger, because
steps are not taken to ensure that television broadcasting is
available to them. Stations should take special steps to ensure
that information about disasters and emergencies are fully
accessible to those who are deaf and hard of hearing, including
in “real time.”</p>

        <sec id="sec-4-2-14">
          <title>D. A Code: Problems and Prospects</title>
          <p>Such a code would of course raise many questions. The first
would involve the problem of enforcement. Without an enforcement
mechanism, a code might have no effect at all, indeed it might be a
form of public deception.167
167 See John Braithwaite, Responsive Business Regulatory Institutions, in
Business, Ethics, and Law 91 (C. Cody and C. Sampford eds. 1993).</p>
          <p>There are several obvious possibilities. The simplest would be
for the NAB to undertake enforcement on its own, just as it did
under the old code. It might, for example, give a seal of approval to
those who are shown to comply with its provisions, and deny a seal
of approval to those who have been shown not to have complied.
The NAB might also give special public recognition to those stations
that have compiled an excellent public service record in the past year.
Such recognition may be awarded for, among other things, meeting
the needs of children in a sustained and creative way, offering
substantive and extended coverage of elections, including interviews,
free air time, and debates, offering substantive and extended coverage
of public issues, and providing opportunities for discussion of
problems facing the local community. At the time of license renewal,
a notation might be given to the FCC that there has been
compliance or continuing or egregious noncompliance with the code.
If the NAB is unwilling to enforce a code of this kind, perhaps a
private group could take the initiative, both promulgating the code
and publicizing and in that (modest) sense sanctioning violations.168
A special problem here is that in light of increasing competition
from non-broadcast programming sources, a code would not be in
the economic interest of broadcasters even if generally adopted, and
this is an unpromising fact for a code’s effectiveness.169 Perhaps
supplemental enforcement will come from rivals of those who defect
from the agreement and violate the code; this is a reasonable
prediction in theory, and something similar has been found in
analogous areas.170</p>
          <p>Any enforcement by the NAB or even a private monitoring
group would be most likely to succeed if accompanied by external
pressures of one sort or another. As in the case of disclosure
requirements, the most promising possibilities include public interest
groups able to mobilize relevant social norms and to focus media
168 This approach would have special advantages in light of the fact that some
stations are not members of the NAB. For NAB stations that must compete with
non-member stations, a code creates an obvious competitive risk, and there is a
continuing question whether it is possible to design strategies, public or private,
to combat this risk.
169 See Gunningham and Grabosky, supra note, at 53-54.
170 See Gunningham and Rees, supra note, at 403.
attention on derelict actors.171 Perhaps such activity would be
accompanied by market pressures of various sorts, as consumer
action has had significant effects on code enforcement in related
areas.172 A degree of FCC interest in the existence of code violations
would also help.</p>
          <p>These points raise a related question: the scope of any such
code. Undoubtedly such a code was less painful, and easier to
operate, when three broadcasters exhausted the universe of
television. Of course broadcasters now find themselves in
competition with many other entertainment sources, including cable
and the Internet. In these circumstances, broadcasters are not likely
to constrain themselves if their competitors are not similarly
constrained. The competition for an audience for news is much
affected by the existence of “tabloid television,” and a broadcaster
who ties himself to the mast may find himself with a significantly
reduced audience. The point suggests that in the development of a
code, broadcasters should perhaps be joined by the National
Association of Cable Television. By itself, however, a code limited to
broadcasters should do considerable good, even if some broadcasters
are reluctant to subscribe to it. When the market reaches the stage in
which broadcasters are merely some of a large number of providers,
with no distinctive status, it might make sense to think of a more
general code (with suitable adjustments for particular kinds of
programmers173). It is worth underlining the point that as in the
context of disclosure, the likelihood of success will increase with the
existence of third-party monitors, both public and private, and also
with a threat of more intrusive action should it prove necessary.174</p>

        <sec id="sec-4-2-15">
          <title>E. Notes on Antitrust Law and the First Amendment</title>
          <p>A code for television broadcasters might be thought to raise
issues of both constitutional and antitrust law. The constitutional
issues are relatively straightforward; the antitrust issues are a bit more
complex. I offer a brief discussion here.
171 See Gunningham and Rees, supra, at 390-92.
172 See id. at 391 (discussing hostile consumer action).
173 For example, it is not clear that a station devoted to children should be
required to provide free air time for political candidates.
174 See Gunningham and Grabosky, supra note, at 55-56.</p>
          <p>There is essentially no risk that a code of the sort suggested here
would create serious first amendment problems. By itself, a code is a
private set of guidelines, and private guidelines by themselves raise
no first amendment issue. If a private group decides to impose
restrictions on the speech of its members, and government is not
involved, the first amendment is irrelevant Of course things would
be different if government mandated any such code.175</p>
          <p>Nor would provisions like those described above be likely to
violate the antitrust laws. The Department of Justice has so
concluded,176 and in two important cases, aspects of previous codes
were upheld against private antitrust attack. A district court refused
to issue an injunction against code standards forbidding cigarette
advertising, despite a claim that these standards were inconsistent
with the antitrust laws.177 A lower court also upheld the provisions
involving standards for advertising for children.178 In these cases, the
175 See Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, 436 U.S. 149 (1978) (private contract raises
no first amendment issue); San Francisco Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v. United States
Olympic Comm., 483 U.S. 522 (1987); Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830
(1982). If a code is a product of government threat, and is effectively required by
government, the first amendment comes into play. See Writers Guild of
America, supra. There can be no question that a governmentally mandated code,
not voluntary but taking the form that we have outlined, would raise legitimate
constitutional problems. This does not necessarily mean that the first amendment
would be violated; but it does mean that the code would have to be tested for
compliance with first amendment principles, including constitutional limits on
content regulation.
176 See note supra.
177 See American Brands, Inc. v. National Ass'n of Broadcasters, 308 F. Supp.
1166 (D.D.C. 1969). The court concluded that the plaintiff was not likely to
prevail on the merits. The court referred in particular to the dangers posed by
cigarette smoking and claimed that the standards and guidelines in the code serve
the “public interest.” Id. at 1169.
178 See American Fed’n of Television &amp; Radio Artists v. National Ass’n of
Broadcasters, 407 F. Supp. 900 (S.D.N.Y. 1976) The rule at issue there said that
children’s program hosts or primary cartoon characters “shall not be utilized to
deliver commercial messages within or adjacent to the programs which feature
such hosts or cartoon characters.” The provision applied as well “to lead-ins to
commercials when such lead-ins contain sell copy or imply endorsement of the
product by program host or primary cartoon character.” The plaintiff attacked the
restrictions, claiming that it restricted the ability of hosts and actors to obtain free
employment for delivery of commercials. The court said, “There is not the
court basically concluded that the restrictions were reasonable and in
the public interest.</p>
          <p>As I have noted, the most recent code met its demise as a result
of an antitrust action brought by the Justice Department in 1979,
based on an allegation that certain provisions of the Code violated
the Sherman Act. But the Justice Department’s complaint was quite
narrow. It involved not the code in general, but three specific kinds
of cartel-like advertising restrictions: (1) time standards, limiting the
amount of commercial material that could be broadcast in an hour;
(2) program interruption standards, which imposed a limit on the
maximum number of commercial announcements per program as
well as on the number of consecutive announcements per
interruption; and (3) multiple product standards, which prohibited
the advertising of two or more products or services within a single
commercial if the commercial was less than 60 seconds in length.
Basically, the court held that the multiple product standards were per
se unlawful, but that the time standards and program interruption
standards could not be tested without an inquiry into the facts. 179
slightest indication of any anti-competitive purpose in the creation of the rule,”
especially since there was no evidence of a motive ““to benefit one class of
performers competitively over another class of performers.” Id. at 902. The court
found it relevant that the rule “resulted from a bona fide concern on the part of
various groups, and the FCC, regarding fair and ethical methods to be used in
television advertising directed to children.” Id. This was “a reasonable rule of
conduct regarding good practice by its members in the public interest and is not
in violation of the antitrust laws.” Id. at 903.
179The district court held that the time and product interruption standards were
not invalid per se. In the court’s view, the distinctive characteristics of the
broadcasting industry argued against a per se rule of invalidity. Because broadcast
frequencies are scarce, because the whole area is subject to regulation, and because
of the fact that there are only sixty minutes in an hour (!), no simple solution
would be sensible. On these two issues, the court also denied summary judgment
for the government under the rule of reason, concluding that there were material
issues of fact. By contrast, the court held that the multiproduct standard was per
se unlawful. In its view, this rule was akin to a standardization agreement by
which food manufacturers set a standard for the ingredients that would be used in
their products. This form of standardization was per se illegitimate. Thus the
court actually invalidated only one provision of the code, on the theory that it was
analytically akin to a system for price-fixing. At the same time, the court denied
summary judgment for the NAB. An important question was whether the time
standards would have the effect of raising or stabilizing the price of commercial</p>
          <p>After the court’s ruling, the NAB suspended enforcement of all
code provisions.180 Doubtless the NAB did this partly for reasons of
economic self-interest, and not only because it was fearful of a legal
challenge. Nonetheless, the district court’s narrow
decision—untested in any court of appeals—has loomed over the
debate about codes. But in its most recent analysis of the problem,
the Department of Justice suggested that networks could agree to
guidelines and principles to reduce unnecessary violence on
television.181 Indeed, this is not an ordinary form of collusion. It is
not as if broadcasters are saying that advertisers must pay a minimum
of $X per advertisement. It is possible that the restrictions under
discussion would have little or no adverse effect on competition; they
may even have good effects on competition.182 Even with a code,
programmers would compete over a great many things, including the
kinds of programming regulated by a code. The code might in a
sense be procompetitive, because it would ensure television coverage
of materials in which there is a substantial public interest and which
might otherwise not be provided. This is so especially in light of the
time (this was the antitrust problem); it was possible, the court said, that any such
effect would be trivial in light of the importance of other factors. If this was true,
the code would not violate the Sherman Act. This is because there is no antitrust
violation without a significant adverse effect on competition. See, e.g., United
States v. Arnold, Schwinn, &amp; Co., 388 U.S. 365, 375 (1967), overruled on other
grounds by Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc. 433 U.S. 36 (1977);
Neeld v. National Hockey League, 594 F.2d 1297 (9th Cir. 1979).
180 In public it claimed that it would seek an appeal, but a consent judgment was
issued, in which the NAB agreed, for ten years, to cease monitoring and
enforcement of the three disputed code provisions.
181 See Letter Of Sheila Anthony, Assistant Attorney General, supra. The
Department of Justice concluded that “the conduct that was at issue in the NAB
case differs significantly from that covered by” an agreement on televised violence.
Id. at 3. In the NAB case, the problem was raising “the price of time,” to “the
detriment of both advertisers and the ultimate consumers of the products
promoted on the air.” Id. By contrast, an agreement covering violence should “be
liked to traditional industry standard-setting efforts that do not necessarily
restrain competition and may have significant procompetitive benefits.” Id. In the
view of the Department of Justice, “efforts to develop and disseminate voluntary
guidelines to reduce the negative impact of television violence should fare well
under the appropriate rule-of-reason antitrist analysis.” Id. at 4.
fact that stations would compete for viewers with respect to the
kinds of programming covered by the code.183</p>
          <p>In light of the distinctive nature of the television market, a code
of the sort under discussion would likely survive a “rule of reason”
inquiry. Any restrictions, such as they are, could be defended as a
means of promoting competition and also various public interest
goals, such as education of children, access for the handicapped, and
democratic and civic functions.184</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-4-2-16">
          <title>F. Less Puzzling Puzzles</title>
          <p>We are now in a position to disentangle the two puzzles
discussed in Part II. The broadcasters on the Committee favored a
code partly because they thought it a good idea in principle and
partly because they had little to lose from it. Though generally
“winners,” they were selected for the Committee because of their
commitment, through both words and deeds, to moderating some of
the adverse effects of competition. They were vulnerable to “winner
take all” effects insofar as they were reluctant to engage in certain
competitive practices. In this way, a code might even help them. But
the NAB would not like a code at all. The broadcasting industry as a
whole would be hurt by such a code, especially because cable
television would not be bound by it. Why should broadcasters, in an
intensely competitive market, give a significant edge to cable?
Especially if the result would be that cable could take, if not all, a lot
more of the viewing audience than it now does? It is not surprising if
183 It is not entirely clear that any plaintiff would have an antitrust injury. The
self-regulation that we are discussing would allow a wide range of choices and
options for consumers and producers. Perhaps some producer of some marginal
programming could claim that he was unable to sell his product because of (for
example) free air time for candidates; but this would be an extremely speculative
injury. Perhaps viewers could argue that they were deprived of certain
programming that they would like; but in view of the wide range of options
available to viewers, this too is speculative. Perhaps some stations or programmers
could contend that a code limited their freedom; but it is not clear that this would
count as an antitrust injury, especially in light of the fact that the code is
voluntary.
184 This idea is bolstered by the line of cases analyzing restrictions by trade
associations and similar entities. See, e.g., NCAA v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S.
85 (1984); Allied Tube &amp; Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, 486 U.S. 492 (1988).
broadcasters who supply a large degree of public interest
programming believe that they would be net winners with a
code—and if the broadcasting industry as a whole believes that it
would be a net loser. Such an industry, cautious about invoking its
own economic interest alone, is all too likely to invoke the antitrust
laws (or the first amendment) for purely strategic and self-interested
reasons.</p>
          <p>This point helps explain the Committee broadcasters’
skepticism about “pay or play” alternatives. A set of rigid public
interest requirements does not hurt them and may even help them,
insofar as it places their competitors under legal duties that they
would themselves meet voluntarily (because of their aspirations or
because of the particular demands of their audience and their
advertisers). A system of “pay or play” would mean that these
broadcasters would be undercut by competitors who, unwilling to
play, would pay—and capture a large audience share, in a version of
“winner-take-most.” But this is not a convincing objection to a
system of “pay or play.” It is true that some of those who “play” will
be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to some of those who
“pay” others to play instead. But by itself this competitive
disadvantage is not worthy of concern, any more than we should be
concerned when, in the environmental context, some of those who
reduce pollution are at a competitive disadvantage with respect to
those who, instead of reducing pollution, pay a substantial fee to
third parties who have reduced pollution, or to the treasury. The
question is what approach yields the best outcome for the public. If
there is too little public interest broadcasting, or too much pollution,
the solution is not the simple command to “play,” or “reduce,” but to
increase the price for failing to play or for failing to reduce.185</p>
          <p>The best defense of a code of the sort I have discussed is that it
would produce “winner-take-less” outcomes, in a way that would
provide significant benefits for the public by diminishing some of the
adverse effects of market competition, and by strengthening
broadcaster norms in favor of obligations to children and to
democratic values. And if this is so, it provides a general lesson about
how voluntary private action might sometimes handle problems

        <title>VII. A Summary</title>
        <p>The discussion has ranged over a number of regulatory tools,
and it may be helpful, by way of summary, to discuss them all briefly
and at once. We have seen that both disclosure and codes have the
advantage of ensuring a minimal government role, in a way that
reduces constitutional concerns and also allows a high degree of
flexibility. The danger is that these remedies will have little effect;
here the key question is whether there are good external monitors,
able to impose reputational or other costs on those who do poorly.
We have also seen that “taxes” on programming that does not serve
public interest goals, and subsidies to programming that does serve
such goals, can have similar effects. A principal problem with
subsidies is that they create an incentive not to provide such
programming voluntarily. The table that follows seems to capture
the basic territory.</p>
        <p>Of course some of these tools could serve as complements rather
than as alternatives. Disclosure makes sense with or without
additional strategies. It should be the least controversial item on the
list; the only real question is what else should accompany it.
Disclosure is likely to work especially well in tandem with voluntary
self-regulation, indeed the two tools are natural allies. By contrast,
mandates and economic incentives are genuine competitors, and in
the current context, economic incentives generally seem best, with
mandates operating as a “backstop,” probably to be eliminated in the
long term.186</p>
        <p>As I have emphasized, these recommendations are designed for
the current stage of telecommunications technology; they are also
likely to make sense for the near term. For the next decade, the key
question is whether initiatives designed for broadcasters should be
applied to cable programmers as well (especially disclosure and
compliance with a code).
186 For an overlapping discussion, emphasizing the value of “policy mixes” in the
context of environmental law, see Gunningham and Grabosky, supra, at 422-448.

In the very long term, when broadcasters occupy no special role, it
may be best to impose disclosure requirements on general-interest
stations, and also to subsidize high-quality programming of various
sorts. It is too soon to know whether the very long-term will come in
the next decade or long thereafter.187</p>

      <sec id="sec-4-4">
        <title>VIII. Conclusion</title>
        <p>Dramatic changes in the emerging communications market do
not provide a sufficient reason to abandon the traditional goal of
ensuring a certain level of public interest programming. To some
extent this conclusion depends on conventional market failures. Thus
I have emphasized the external benefits that come from public
interest programming and also the peculiar characteristics of the
broadcasting market, where viewers, or eyeballs, are a commodity
provided to advertisers. To some extent this conclusion view turns on
a rejection of economic principles as the foundation for
communications policy. With respect to public interest
programming, viewers’ tastes may be a product of an undesirable set
of communications options, and in their capacity as citizens, they
may well want to make things better rather than worse. Especially in
light of the role of the communications media in the production of
culture—and hence both preferences and values—it is entirely
legitimate for a democratic government to refuse to make
“consumption choices” the exclusive basis for policy design. Thus I
have emphasized that a public committed to deliberative democracy
might support initiatives designed to provide better programming for
children and better coverage of public issues. This is so especially in
light of the fact that a significant minority of Americans lack cable or
other alternatives, and hence continue to depend on broadcasters for
television.</p>
        <p>These points suggest that for the relevant future,188 public
interest standards deserve to play a large role. For the most part,
187 See Owen, supra, at 311-26 (predicting that convergence will take a long
time, with the suggestion that the Internet may never become an important
means of delivering television).
188 In the long-term, when broadcasters have little or no distinctive role, it may
be best to rely on government subsidies for high-quality broadcasting and on
disclosure requirements for general-interest programmers. See above.</p>
