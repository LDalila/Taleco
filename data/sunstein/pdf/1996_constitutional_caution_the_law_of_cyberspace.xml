        <title>I. GOVERNMENT FAILURE AND CONSTITUTIONAL FALURE</title>
        <p>Begin with a platitude: When government attempts to
regulate the market, many things may go wrong. In the familiar
litany, regulation may be counterproductive, producing outcomes
that defeat the aspirations of well-meaning reformers. Or,
regulation may be futile, as the market adapts to the relevant
initiatives. Or, regulation may produce unanticipated harmful
consequences. All of these results may follow from the regulators'
incomplete understanding of the system into which they are
attempting to intervene. This is not an argument that government
should never intervene in markets. But it is certainly a reason
for caution, for attempting to acquire a good deal of information,
and for proceeding in an experimental, nondogmatic way.</p>
        <p>It is less often recognized that constitutional law can have
similar problems. Supreme Court decisions may be
counterproductive. If it is understood as a case about gender equality, Roe v
Wade' is a possible example since the Court's decision may well
have damaged the effort to produce gender equality.2 Or
Supreme Court decisions may be futile. Sometimes Fourth
Amendment decisions seem to have this feature; it is far from clear that
police officers comply as a matter of course with Supreme Court
pronouncements about Fourth Amendment requirements.
Supreme Court decisions may also have harmful unanticipated
consequences. This is true, for example, of many efforts in the
area of judge-led social reform.'</p>

(1985).</p>
        <p>' See Donald L. Horowitz, The Courts and Social Policy (Brookings Institution,
1977).</p>
        <p>Justice Holmes's work on constitutional law was built largely
on seeing the political process as a kind of market, subject, like
other markets, to forces of supply and demand." As a regulator of
the political market, the Supreme Court may reach decisions that
reflect ignorance of relevant factors. Because they interfere with
the political market, Supreme Court decisions may also disturb
some kind of social equilibrium. It is ironic but true that many
people alert to the problems with government interference with
economic markets are quite sanguine about Supreme Court
interference with political markets.' This was true in the 1920s when
constitutional law assumed center stage in debates over
regulation of new and old markets.6 It is true as the twenty-first
century approaches, as constitutional law takes center stage in
debates over new communications markets, prominently including
the Internet.</p>
        <p>In some areas, the Supreme Court, firmly aware of its own
limitations and perhaps aware of the marketlike nature of
politics, operates casuistically. It avoids broad rules. It is aware of
underlying complexities of both fact and value. In the area of
affirmative action, this has been the Court's preferred course
The Court has avoided simple rules. Its decisions have been
highly case specific. The democratic process has been given a lot of
room to maneuver.</p>
        <p>I suggest that this casuistical model makes sense for
cyberspace.' This is so for two reasons. First, underlying values
are in flux and not simple to sort out. There is, for example, a
large debate over the regulation of pornography, especially
pornography about and for children, on the Internet. There is also a
large debate about the relationships among the Internet,
children, and parental control.' It is also unclear that the Court's
free speech doctrine-founded on the categories of
viewpointbased, content-based, and content-neutral regulation-makes
complete sense. If, for example, the government attempts to
promote educational and public-affairs programming, it is acting on
a content-discriminatory basis, but are its actions for that reason
illegitimate?</p>
        <p>The problem is not limited to values. On the underlying
facts, things are changing very rapidly, and courts know
relatively little; but the facts are crucial to the analysis. The new
communications technologies in general are a good example. If cable
television flourishes, will ordinary broadcasters be at risk in a
way that threatens free programming?" Courts are not likely to
be in a good position to answer this question. This was the key
problem in the Turner case,1 and while there is reason to think
that interest-group pressures underlay the relevant statute,
predictive issues are not, in general, well-suited to judicial
resolution. In such circumstances the Court does best if it proceeds
cautiously and with humility, allowing some room for political
judgment and maneuvering in a setting that is in such flux. 2</p>
        <p>In the area of cyberspace, there is a related but more general
issue. I believe that the First Amendment is sometimes playing
substantially the same role with respect to the communications
market as did the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to the
labor market in the period from 1905 through 1936.13 In that
period, questions about minimum-wage and maximum-hour laws,
or efforts to protect labor unions, were answered in significant
part by asking: What does the Due Process Clause say on such
questions? 4 In retrospect we can see that this was a bad way to
proceed-that it would have been much better to dispense with
lawyers and cases and to focus instead on underlying questions of
fact and value, questions for which purely legal tools are
inadequate. The problems of policy should be solved by people who
understand problems of policy, not by lawyers skilled in reading
Supreme Court opinions.</p>

an approach quite similar to what I am suggesting here. I am indebted to Professor Lessig
for valuable discussion.</p>

        <p>To some extent, the same is true for cyberspace. Too often,
hard questions are answered by consulting previous cases, as if
the First Amendment, judicially understood, supplies the
foundations for choosing regulatory policy for the emerging speech
market. Of course the First Amendment has a good deal to say about
legitimate regulatory strategies. Obviously, some such strategies
would violate the First Amendment. But the relevant questions
are first and foremost ones of policy rather than constitutional
law; courts and judges would do well to remember this point.</p>

        <title>II. EXAMPLES OF POTENTIAL AREAS OF REGULATION</title>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-3">
        <title>A. Child Pornography, Obscenity, Parental Control</title>
        <p>Consider a few examples. With the touch of a button, it is
now possible to reach millions of people, whether or not they
want to be reached. Libelous statements, commercial messages,
hate speech, child pornography, threats-the cost of sending all
of these to millions is very low. This simple fact may make it
necessary to rethink constitutional categories. There has been
particular concern recently about the free availability of sexually
explicit materials on the Internet, especially in the context of
materials soliciting, involving, or available to children."5
Perhaps the government should be allowed to regulate not only child
pornography, and not only obscenity, but a somewhat broader
range of materials because of the distinctive interest in
protecting children.16 At least the Court's obscenity doctrine bears
uncertainly on this question, and mechanical use of that doctrine
may produce error. It is important to get a sense of the nature of
the underlying problem before reaching confident conclusions. 7
5 The increasing attention being given to pornography on the Internet is evidenced
by the fact that from Spring 1991 to January 24, 1994, Lexis-Nexis listed only 69 articles
on this subject, as contrasted with 3,451 articles on this subject entered from January 24,
1994 to January 24, 1996.</p>
        <p>'" See S 314, 104th Cong, 1st Sess (Jan 30, 1995) in 141 Cong Rec S 1953 (Feb 1,
1995). Popularly known as the Communications Decency Act of 1995, was introduced by
Senator Jim Exon (D-Neb) in the United States Senate and enacted into law January 31,
1996 as the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Pub L No 104-104, 110 Stat 133 (1996),
amending 47 USC § 223. Its definition of "harm to children," goes beyond obscenity to
include, for example, materials that contain "indecency or nudity." Id, amending 47 USC
§ 223(a)(1)(A)(ii). This provision extends far beyond current law. Portions of the
Communications Decency Act of 1996 were declared unconstitutional in ACLU v Reno, 929 F
Supp 824 (ED Pa 1996) and in Shea v Reno, 930 F Supp 916 (SD NY 1996). In my view
these decisions were correct. See notes 61-63 and accompanying text.</p>
        <p>17 A narrow, and in my view correct, decision is DenverArea
EducationalTelecommunications Consortium, Inc. v FCC, 116 S Ct 2374, 2390 (1996) (upholding a grant of</p>
        <p>Related issues are raised by the use of the Internet to
circulate libelous, threatening, or sexually violent material about an
identifiable person. It may well be that the easy transmission of
such material to millions of people will justify deference to
reasonable legislative judgments.18</p>
        <p>Suppose that the government intends to assist parental
control by allowing families to "block" certain material and to
prevent it from entering the home. This idea would bear an obvious
resemblance to the controversial "v-chip" proposal that was
recently enacted by Congress. 9 Through this enactment, Congress
is requiring new televisions to be equipped with technology
enabling parents to block certain programming. The requirement
may substantially affect programming because of anticipated
parental blocking; but this by itself is not constitutionally
decisive. The existence of such an effect resulting from anticipated
viewer behavior is part of a well-functioning market. Proposals of
this sort would facilitate parental control, but would not involve
federal content regulation; they would not involve direct
governmental control or censorship of the speech market."0 Because
they are noncensorial and facilitative, courts should treat them
more leniently.</p>
        <p>The only serious questions include selectivity and bias: Is the
government facilitating the exclusion of material of which the
government disapproves? If so, the fact that no direct regulation
is involved is not enough; impermissible selectivity would be
objectionable by itself. Certainly it would be troublesome if the
government enabled people to screen out material of a certain,
governmentally disapproved content; imagine a governmentally
mandated "Democrat chip" or "Gingrich chip" or "liberal chip."
But the "v-chip" is best seen as lacking this feature. It would
discriminate on the basis of content, not on the basis of
viewpermission to exclude "indecent" programming),</p>
        <p>" But see United States v Baker, 890 F Supp 1375 (1995). In that case, the
defendants sent sexually explicit e-mail to one another which contained the graphic description
of the torture, rape, and murder of a classmate of one of the defendants. The government
charged the defendants with transmitting threats to injure or kidnap another. The court
dismissed the charges, finding that the descriptions contained in the e-mail were fiction
and did not constitute a "true threat" under the statute.</p>

1994).</p>
        <p>0 See Denver Area, 116 S Ct at 2390, which is strong support for the validity of the
v-chip, especially insofar as it upholds § 10(a) of the Cable Television Consumer
Protection and Competition Act of 1992, § 10(a), Pub L No 102-385, 106 Stat 1486, codified at 47
USC § 532(h) (1994).
point. For this reason it should probably be upheld, at least on
an appropriate factual record demonstrating that the government
is attempting to combat harm rather than content or
viewpoint.2 What I am emphasizing here is that preexisting
categories do not give clear guidance and that it is best for the courts to
proceed in a cautious manner.</p>

      <sec id="sec-2-4">
        <title>B. Violence and the Internet</title>
        <p>Let me turn now to a question that has received considerable
public attention and that particularly shows the need for a
degree of judicial caution in using the First Amendment: the
question of violent speech on the Internet." Applying ordinary
standards, constitutional lawyers may well believe that this is a
simple issue, settled by Brandenburg v Ohio.2 But things are more
complex.</p>
        <p>The controversy arose last spring when talk-show host G.
Gordon Liddy, speaking on the radio to millions of people,
explained how to shoot agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms: "Head shots, head shots .... Kill the sons of
bitches."24 Later he said, "[s]hoot twice to the belly and if that
does not work, shoot to the groin area."25 On March 23, the full
text of the Terrorist's Handbook was posted on the Internet,
including instructions on how to make a bomb (the same bomb,
as it happens, that was used in Oklahoma City)." By the time
of the Oklahoma bombing on April 19, three more people had
posted bomb-making instructions, which could also be found on
the Internet in the Anarchist's Cookbook.27 On the National
Rifle Association's Internet "Bullet 'N' Board," someone calling
himself "Warmaster" explained how to make bombs using
babyfood jars.28 Warmaster wrote, "These simple, powerful bombs
are not very well known even though all the materials can be
easily obtained by anyone (including minors)."29 After the
Oklahoma bombing, an anonymous notice was posted to dozens of
Usenet news groups listing all the materials in the Oklahoma
City bomb, explaining why the bomb allegedly did not fully
explode and exploring how to improve future bombs.30</p>
        <p>Fifty hate groups are reported to be communicating on the
Internet, sometimes about conspiracies and (by now this will
come as no surprise) formulas for making bombs.3 On
shortwave radio, people talk about bizarre United Nations plots
and urge that "the American people ought to go there bodily, rip
down the United Nations building and kick those bastards right
off our soil.""2 In fact, last year Rush Limbaugh, who does not
advocate violence, said to his audience, "The second violent
American revolution is just about, I got my fingers about a fourth
of an inch apart, is just about that far away. Because these
people are sick and tired of a bunch of bureaucrats in Washington
driving into town and telling them what they can and can't
do. 33</p>
        <p>In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, a national
debate has erupted about speech over the Internet counseling
violence or inciting hatred of public officials. 4 Of course it is
unclear whether such speech has had a causal role in any act of
bombing. But new technologies, and particularly the Internet,
have put the problem of incitement into sharp relief. It is likely,
perhaps inevitable, that hateful and violent messages carried
over the airwaves and the Internet will someday be responsible
for acts of violence. This is simply a statement of probability. The
questions raised for constitutional lawyers are these: Is that
probability grounds for restricting such speech? Would
restrictions on speech advocating violence or showing how to engage in
violent acts be acceptable under the First Amendment? And how
do preexisting categories bear on the current issue?</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>1. The clear and present dangerdoctrine and its evolution.</title>
      <p>It should go without saying that recent events should not be
a pretext for allowing the government to control political dissent,
including extremist speech and legitimate hyperbole (a large and
important category). But the new and unanswered question has
to do with the constitutionality of restrictions on speech that
expressly advocates illegal, murderous violence in messages to
mass audiences. For most of American history, the courts held
that no one has a right to advocate violations of the law."5 They
ruled that advocacy of crime is wholly outside of the First
Amendment-akin to a criminal attempt and punishable as
such. 6 Indeed, many of the judges .revered as the strongest
champions of free speech believed that express advocacy of crime
was punishable. Judge Learned Hand, in his great 1917 opinion
in Masses Publishing Co. v Patten3,7 established himself as a
true hero of free speech when he said that even dangerous
dissident speech was generally protected against government
regulation. But Hand himself agreed that government could regulate
any speaker who would "counsel or advise a man" to commit an
unlawful act.3"</p>
      <p>In the same period the Supreme Court concluded that
government could punish all speech, including advocacy of illegality,
that had a "tendency" to produce illegality.39 Justices Holmes
and Brandeis, the dissenters from this conclusion, took a
different approach, saying that speech could be subjected to regulation
only if it was likely to produce imminent harm;" thus they
originated the famous "clear and present danger" test.4' But even
Holmes and Brandeis suggested that the government could
punish speakers who had the explicit intention of encouraging
crime.42</p>
      <p>For many years thereafter, the Supreme Court tried to
distinguish between speech that was meant as a contribution to
democratic deliberation and speech that was designed to
encourage illegality. 3 The former was protected; the latter was not. In
1951 the Court concluded in Dennis v United States" that a
danger need not be so "clear and present" if the ultimate harm
was very grave.45 The break in the doctrine did not come until
the Court's 1969 decision in Brandenburg v Ohio." There the
Court said the government could not take action against a
member of the Ku Klux Klan, who said, among other things, "[W]e're
not a revengent organization, but if our President, our Congress,
our Supreme Court, continues to suppress the white, Caucasian
race, it's possible that there might have to be some revengence
taken."47 The speaker did not explicitly advocate illegal acts or
illegal violence. But in its decision, the Court announced a broad
principle, ruling that the right to free speech does "not permit a
State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law
violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or
producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or
produce such action."48</p>
      <p>Offering extraordinarily broad protection to political dissent,
the Court required the government to meet three different
criteria to regulate speech.49 First, the speaker must promote not
just any lawless action but "imminent" lawless action.5 ° Second,
the imminent lawless action must be "likely" to occur.5 Third,
the speaker must intend to produce imminent lawless action.52</p>

The Brandenburgtest borrows something from Hand and
something from Holmes and produces a standard even more protective
of speech than either of theirs.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>2. Old standards,new technology.</title>
      <p>Applied straightforwardly, the Brandenburg test seems to
protect most speech that can be heard on the airwaves or found
on the Internet. It suggests that there is no need for casuistry
and that a simple rule can resolve all cases. And in general, the
Brandenburg test makes a great deal of sense. Remarks like
those quoted from Rush Limbaugh unquestionably qualify for
protection; such remarks are not likely to incite imminent
lawless action, and in any case they are not "directed to" producing
such action. They should also qualify as legitimate hyperbole, a
category recognized in a 1969 decision allowing a war protester
to say, "If they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to
get in my sights is L. B. J."53 Even Liddy's irresponsible
statements might receive protection insofar as they could be viewed as
unlikely to produce imminent illegality. A high degree of
protection and breathing space makes a great deal of sense whenever
the speech at issue is political protest, which lies at the core of
the First Amendment.</p>
      <p>But there is some ambiguity in the Brandenburg test,
especially in the context of modern technologies, and it is here that a
high degree of judicial caution is appropriate. Suppose that an
incendiary speech, expressly advocating illegal violence, is not
likely to produce lawlessness in any particular listener or viewer.
But suppose too that it is believed that of the millions of
listeners, one or two, or ten, may well be provoked to act, and perhaps
to imminent, illegal violence. Might the government ban advocacy
of criminal violence in mass communications when it is
reasonable to think that one person, or a few, will take action?
Brandenburg offers a reasonable approach to the somewhat
vague speech in question in that case, which was made in a
setting where relatively few people were in earshot. But the case
offers unclear guidance on the express advocacy of criminal
violence via the airwaves or the Internet.</p>
      <p>When messages advocating murderous violence are sent to
large numbers of people, it is possible to think that the
Brandenburg calculus changes: Government may well have the
authority to stop speakers from expressly advocating the illegal
5- Watts v United States, 394 US 705, 706 (1969).
use of force, at least if it is designed to kill people. The calculus
changes when the risk of harm increases because of the sheer
number of people exposed. Hence the requirement of causation
might be loosened, at least for explicit advocacy of murder. There
is little democratic value in protecting simple counsels of
murder, 4 and the ordinary Brandenburg requirements might be
loosened where the risks are great. Consider, for example, the
fact that Congress has made it a crime to threaten to assassinate
the President, and the Court has cast no doubt on that restriction
of speech.55 It would be a short step, not threatening legitimate
public dissent, for the Federal Communications Commission to
impose civil sanctions on those who expressly advocate illegal
acts aimed at killing people. Courts might well conclude that the
government may use its power over the airwaves to ensure that
this sort of advocacy does not occur.</p>
      <p>Of course, there are serious problems in drawing the line
between counsels of violence that should be subject to regulation
and those that should not. We might begin (and perhaps we
should end) with restrictions on express advocacy of unlawful
killing; this is the clearest case. I am not trying to draw
conclusions so much as I am trying to suggest reasons for courts to be
cautious in invoking the Constitution. In any case, we can now
see that existing doctrine does not justify a simple conclusion. It
was built on different factual circumstances; it was designed for
what was, with respect to communications, a quite different
world. The degree of danger from counsels of murder has
increased with the rise of the Internet.</p>
      <p>Authorizing the restriction of any speech, even counsels of
violent crime, creates serious risks. It is unnecessary to
emphasize that government often overreacts to short-term events, and
the 1995 Oklahoma City tragedy, for example, should not be the
occasion for an attack on extremist political dissent. Vigorous,
even hateful, criticism of government is very much at the heart of
the right to free speech. Certainly advocacy of law violation can
' The case might be different, however, if the counsel of violence is made part of an
actual political argument. See Cohen v California,403 US 15 (1971) (holding that a state
could not, consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, make wearing a
jacket with the words "Fuck the Draft" a criminal offense).</p>
      <p>5' See Watts, 394 US at 707 (upholding the facial validity of a statute criminalizing
threats of violence directed against the President because of the "overwhelmin[g] interest
in protecting the safety of [the] Chief Executive and in allowing him to perform his duties
without interference from threats of physical violence"). See also R.A. v St. Paul, 505
US 377 (1992) (stating "the Federal Government can criminalize only those threats of
violence that are directed against the President").
be an appropriate part of democratic debate. As the example of
Martin Luther King, Jr. testifies, there is an honorable tradition
of civil disobedience. We should sharply distinguish, however,
King's form of nonviolent civil disobedience from counsels or acts
of murder. The principle condemning government regulation of
political opinions, including the advocacy of illegal acts, need not
be interpreted to bar the government from restricting advocacy of
unlawful killing on the mass media. These are hard cases, and
courts should be reluctant to conclude that the First Amendment
forbids well-designed legislative initiatives.</p>

containing instructions on how to build weapons of mass destruction?
The Brandenburg test was designed mostly to protect unpopular
points of view from government controls; it need not protect the
publication of bomb manuals, at least if these manuals are being
transmitted to millions of people. Instructions for building bombs
are not a point of view, and if government wants to stop the
mass dissemination of this material, it should probably be
allowed to do so. A lower court so ruled in a 1979 case involving an
article in The Progressivethat described how to make a hydrogen
bomb.56 The court's argument is even stronger as applied to the
speech on the Internet, where so many people can be reached so
easily.5 7 In such a case, the potential harm from the relevant
materials is significantly increased. And bomb manuals, qua
bomb manuals, do not deserve the highest degree of
constitution56 See United States v Progressive,Inc., 467 F Supp 990 (WD Wis 1979), dismissed by
610 F2d 819 (7th Cir 1979) (unpublished order).</p>
      <p>17 It is worth observing here that the nation's leaders can do a good deal short of
regulation. The President and other public officials should exercise their own rights of free
speech to challenge hateful, incendiary speech. Although public officials could abuse these
rights so as to chill legitimate protest, President Clinton's statements condemning hatred
on the radio and on the Internet were entirely on the mark. Public disapproval may
ultimately have a salutary effect (as it recently did in the case of violent television shows),
even without the force of law.</p>
      <p>In addition, private institutions, such as broadcasting stations, should think
carefully about their own civic responsibilities. An owner of a station or a programming manager
is under no constitutional obligation to air speakers who encourage illegal violence.
Stations that deny airtime for such views do no harm to the First Amendment but on the
contrary exercise their own rights, and in just the right way. In recent months, public and
private concern about hate-mongering has encouraged some stations to cancel G. Gordon
Liddy's show; this is not a threat to free speech but an exercise of civic duties. Similarly,
private online networks, such as Prodigy and America Online, have not only a right but a
moral obligation to discourage speech that expressly counsels illegal killing.
al protection. Regulation of instructions on how to commit
terrorist acts does not place the government in a position where it does
not belong.5"</p>
      <sec id="sec-5-1">
        <title>III. QUALIFICATIONS</title>
        <p>None of this suggests that the First Amendment has no role
in cyberspace. I suggest that the Court should proceed
confidently in three kinds of cases. The first involves those in which the
government is discriminating on the basis of viewpoint. The
prohibition on viewpoint discrimination is a natural inference from
the First Amendment's ban on governmental favoritism. If the
government regulates the Internet so as to preclude or prefer
viewpoints of the government's liking, the First Amendment
requires invalidation.</p>
        <p>The second category includes cases in which government is
regulating political speech. The heart of the First Amendment
lies in democratic self-governance,5 9 and when the government
regulates political speech, there is special basis for suspicion. The
only qualification is that courts should probably uphold
viewpoint-neutral efforts to promote education and greater attention
to public issues."0</p>
        <p>Finally, courts should strike down palpably vague or
overbroad statutes."1 Nonpolitical speech may certainly be
regu50 Progressive,467 F Supp at 990, however, involved a distinctive issue: an effort to
show how easy it is to learn how to make a bomb.</p>
        <p>"9 See Alexander Meiklejohn, Free Speech and its Relation to Self-Government
(Harper &amp; Row, 1948); Cass R. Sunstein, Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech (Free
Press, 1993).</p>
        <p>o See Cass R. Sunstein, The First Amendment in Cyberspace, 104 Yale L J 1757
(1995).</p>
        <p>", For key cases on the overbreadth doctrine, see Gooding v Wilson, 405 US 518, 519
(1972) (holding a Georgia statute to be on its face unconstitutionally vague and overbroad
in providing that any person using to another "opprobrious words or abusive language,
tending to cause a breach of the peace.., shall be guilty of a misdemeanor," when
Georgia courts had held that the statute did not only apply to "fighting words"); Broadrick v
Oklahoma, 413 US 601 (1973) (holding that an Oklahoma statute which prohibited any
employee in the classified service from receiving or soliciting any assessment or
contribution for any political organization or candidacy, did not set out sufficiently explicit
standards, although it was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad on its face); City Council
of the City of Los Angeles v Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 US 789 (1984) (holding that an
ordinance prohibiting posting of signs on public property was not unconstitutional as
applied to expressive activities of a group of supporters of a political candidate); Board of
Airport Commissioners of the City of Los Angeles v Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 US 569 (1987)
(holding that a regulation banning all 'First Amendment activities" within the airport's
"Central Terminal Area" was facially unconstitutional under the overbreadth doctrine
because no conceivable governmental interest could justify this absolute prohibition of
lated in a constitutionally unacceptable manner. Statutes that
produce guessing games for regulated parties create an
unacceptable risk. Congress should be expected to regulate with at least a
reasonable degree of clarity.62 Thus lower courts were correct to
invalidate a vague and broad statute banning "indecent" speech
on the Internet. 3</p>

      <sec id="sec-5-2">
        <title>CONCLUSION</title>
        <p>When values and institutions are in flux, it is appropriate for
the Court to proceed casuistically and to avoid broad rulings. The
constitutional issues raised by cyberspace will turn on issues that
cannot be fully resolved in 1995, 1996, or even 1999. In some
ways, the First Amendment is, with respect to modern
communications markets, playing the same pernicious role as did the Due
Process Clause in the early part of the twentieth century with
respect to labor markets. Hard issues of value and fact-issues of
policy in which policy analysts should play a large role-are
displaced by reference to constitutional categories, some of them
quite arcane, and some of them likely to be ill-suited to a good
understanding of the underlying phenomena. In a period of rapid
change and technological uncertainty, in which those schooled in
law are likely to be ignorant, there is much room for tentative,
speech); Brockett v Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 US 491 (1985) (deferring to Court of
Appeal's conclusion that a Washington statute which included "lust" within its definition
of "prurient" was unconstitutionally overbroad, but reversing the decision on the ground
that the lower court should have partially invalidated the statute as to the portion
including "lust" rather than entirely invalidating it). But see New York v Ferber, 458 US 747
(1982) (holding that a child pornography statute which prohibited "lewd exhibition of the
genitals" was not overbroad).</p>
        <p>For key cases on the vagueness doctrine, see Connally v General Construction Co.,
269 US 385, 391 (1926) (holding that a law is facially void if it is vague enough that
people "of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its
application"); Grayned v Rockford, 408 US 104 (1972) (stating that it is a basic principle
that a law which fails to clearly define the conduct it proscribes is unconstitutional);
Kolender v Lawson, 461 US 352, 361 (1983) (holding that an antiloitering statute
requiring people to carry identification" and to account for their presence if questioned by a
police officer was unconstitutionally vague because the.law reached "a substantial amount
of [protected First Amendment] conduct").</p>
        <p>6 An example of a law that could (and should) be held to be overbroad is the
Communications Decency Act of 1996. Pub L No 104-104, 110 Stat 133 (1996), amending 47
USC § 223 (cited in note 16). This Act makes all telecommunications providers doing
business in the United States potentially liable for the content of anythingsent over their
networks including "indecent" or "filthy" speech. Id, amending 47 USC § 223(a)(1)(A)(ii)
(cited in note 16):</p>

be (at least relatively) cautious.
