      <p>Janet and I, and the others, have kept it secret for all these
years, and I must tell you that I'm pleased about that. But it's
time, I think.</p>
      <p>It was a warm spring morning when Justice Powell called
me into his office. "This is a hard case for me," he said,
"because I've never met a homosexual." Of course I was
stunnedhow could he possibly think that?-but at first I kept my silence,
even though several of Justice Powell's own law clerks had been
gay. I really wasn't sure what to do. But that afternoon I talked
to my co-clerk Janet, and after a lot of soul-searching and a
good, long, hard talk, we decided that the Justice (that's what we
1. Karl N. Llewellyn Professor of Jurisprudence, University of Chicago.
called him) could not be asked to decide this case without
knowing a little more.</p>
      <p>So we took a big risk. We called two of his gay clerks and
asked if we could tell the Justice that he had indeed met a
homosexual, or two, or more.</p>
      <p>Please don't be shocked that we did this, Helen. Maybe it
wasn't exactly ethical, but we didn't tell our predecessors
anything about the Hardwick case, or anything about our
discussions with Justice Powell about the legal issues involved. We
disclosed no inside information. We were just asking whether
the closet might be opened a little bit. (You might not know
what that means. The "closet" is the term that was used to mean
where gay people stayed, when they kept secret the fact that
they were gay. This must seem mysterious to you, I know.) We
wanted the Justice to know a bit more than he did. We actually
thought that it was relevant.</p>
      <p>Anyway we got their permission, and the next morning, at
10 am, we went into the Justice's office and said, in brief, "We
think you ought to know that you have met a homosexual, or
two, or more. In fact some of your own clerks have been
homosexuals." And then we named two of them. Well, the Justice
was stunned. For a while he was silent. Then he said, very
slowly, "Why didn't I know?" And then, a little angrily: "Why
didn't they tell me?" And then, with some grief, and quietly:
"Oh my." And then, very firmly: "I need to be alone now."</p>
      <p>I never knew what happened next. But I know that Justice
Powell stayed in his office, alone, for nearly three hours. We
were all told that he was "not to be disturbed." I believe that he
did a lot of thinking. I also suspect-though I'm not sure-that
he called the two clerks we mentioned.</p>
      <p>As you know, Justice Powell was a crucial vote in Bowers v.
Hardwick, striking down that Georgia sodomy statute. What
you don't know is the firmness with which he stood by his vote,
in the face of frequent, and sometimes severe, entreaties from
his conservative colleagues. But everyone respected Lewis
Powell. And I think that those famous passages about discrimination
and secrecy in Justice Blackmun's majority opinion had a lot to
do with Justice Powell's thinking about the case. And my
private hunch is that Justice O'Connor would have voted with
Justice White if not for Justice Powell's private eloquence, and
intense feelings, about the rights involved.</p>
      <p>SYMPOSIUM: SUNSTEIN</p>
      <p>Well, what happened next is on the public record; but it
must seem like ancient history to you! Many people celebrated
the outcome as a great day for civil rights, and Michael
Hardwick was on the cover of all the leading magazines, and he soon
became a hero and a celebrity. President Reagan denounced the
Court's decision and denounced the Court as a whole, and he
strongly supported the Defense of Marriage Amendment, which
became a focal point of public debate for the next decade.
President Hatch-what a firebrand! -had two pretty successful
terms, defeating a mealy-mouthed Southern Democrat (what
was his name?), who simply would not take a clear stand for, or
against, the Hardwick decision.</p>
      <p>You know, Helen, I actually thought the Defense of
Marriage Amendment would finally pass under President Quayle
(boy was he a canny politician). But the key states-New York,
California, New Jersey, Illinois, and Michigan-somehow stood
firm. Bless those framers; it's awfully hard to change the
Constitution.</p>
      <p>You're too young to know this, at least not in any detail, but
1990-2010 was a grim time for this wonderful country. There
was a lot of anti-gay violence, and some governors seemed to
think that that was just fine. Though the public would not
repudiate Hardwick, the whole cause of civil rights was on thin ice.
When President Quayle abolished affirmative action in 2003, the
country seemed to me in big trouble. And the deficit went
completely out of control; that was the most serious problem, I think.
People were awfully worried about the economy, and the
recession of the mid-1990s-some called it a depression-was bound
to make it a bad period for civil rights.</p>
      <p>It certainly took a while, but as this country always does, we
got back on track. Old Man Bradley finally made it to the White
House-the first Democrat since Jimmy Carter; imagine that!
and he certainly did a wonderful job. And now the Civil Rights
Act bars discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
Justice Powell certainly could not have imagined that-or that
Bowers v. Hardwick, his pride and joy, would be invoked in the
President's signing statement! And to think that now everyone
thinks that Hardwick was right, that it stands with Brown itself
as a symbol of constitutional justice-Helen, I have to tell you,
that's the hardest thing for your old grampa to believe.</p>
      <p>I don't know if you study this in law school, but Lewis
Powell did us proud. Before he died, he said in an interview that his
vote in Bowers v. Hardwickwas "the best vote I ever cast, and if
I had it to do over again, I would do exactly the same thing." I
don't know if he was a great man, Helen. But I do know that he
was a good man.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I wonder a bit about what would happened if I
hadn't talked to Janet and if we hadn't made those phone calls.
Would Justice Powell have voted the way he did? Maybe the
Court would have come out the other way; is that possible? And
if it had, would things have been different? You never know.</p>
      <p>Well, that's my story, my little graduation present for you.
It's your story now, not mine. Do with it as you wish.</p>
      <p>Helen, you're a woman now, and I don't have anything to
teach you, not any more. But maybe you'll forgive one small
plea from an old man. In the law, you'll have a lot of chances to
do something that might make a difference, small or large. Even
if you're not sure, maybe you'll make that phone call.
Much love,</p>
